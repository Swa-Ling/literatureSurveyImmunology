        <tr id="Immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment for a wide variety of cancers yet its use has been relatively limited in childhood malignancies. With the introduction of bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE®) and chimeric antigen T-cell receptor technologies, previously refractory patients have attained remission, including molecularly negative states of disease, thus providing the possibility of long-term cure. Blinatumomab is a widely available CD3-CD19 BiTE that has dramatically changed the landscape of therapy for some children with precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphomas. Challenges remain with using BiTE in a broader population although the appeal of now-confirmed reduced toxicity and deeper molecular remissions suggests that this approach will be an essential part of future treatment of childhood B-ALL. Herein, we review some of the pertinent literature covering clinical trials with blinatumomab and address future approaches and combination trials including BiTE.">

Autoreactive memory B cells contribute to chronic and progressive courses in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The efficacy of belimumab (BEL), the first approved biologic treatment for SLE and lupus nephritis (LN), is generally attributed to depletion of activated naïve B cells and inhibition of B cell activation. BEL's effect on memory B cells (MBCs) is currently unexplained. We performed an in-depth cellular and transcriptomic analysis of BEL's impact on the blood MBC compartment in patients with SLE.


METHODS
A retrospective meta-analysis was conducted, pooling flow cytometry data from four randomized trials involving 1245 patients with SLE treated with intravenous BEL or placebo. Then, extensive MBC phenotyping was performed using high-sensitivity flow cytometry in patients with mild/moderate SLE and severe SLE/LN treated with subcutaneous BEL. Finally, transcriptomic characterization of surging MBCs was performed by single-cell RNA sequencing.


RESULTS
In BEL-treated patients, a significant increase in circulating MBCs, in a broad range of MBC subsets, was established at week 2, gradually returning to baseline by week 52. The increase was most prominent in patients with higher SLE disease activity, serologically active patients, and patients aged ≤18 years. MBCs had a non-proliferating phenotype with a prominent decrease in activation status and downregulation of numerous migration genes.


CONCLUSION
Upon BEL initiation, an increase of MBCs was firmly established. In the small cohort investigated, circulating MBCs were de-activated, non-proliferative, and demonstrated characteristics of disrupted lymphocyte trafficking, expanding on our understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of B cell-activating factor inhibition by BEL.

To report safety and efficacy of CD19-targeting CAR T cells in a child with refractory juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We describe the case of a 12-year-old Caucasian boy with severe, chronically active JDM, refractory to multiple immunosuppressive treatment lines, including B-cell depletion with rituximab. The patient received a single infusion of fresh, autologous, second-generation anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product (lentiviral vector) manufactured on the Prodigy device (1x106 CAR T cells/kg), after lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m2 over 2 days) and fludarabine (90 mg/m2 over 3 days). Immunosuppressive and glucocorticoid treatment were withdrawn before leukapheresis and CAR T-cell infusion.


RESULTS
Before anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, the patient had persistent severe skin and muscular disease activity. CAR T cells expanded significantly (peak at day 7, 32.69 cells/μL). Complete B-cell depletion was documented on day 5 in blood and at week 2 in bone marrow. The patient presented fever as part of mild cytokine release syndrome (G1), transient anemia (G2) and neutropenia (G4). Neither infection nor neurotoxicity were observed. Laboratory tests, MRI imaging, Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA), Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) and Cutaneous Assessment Tool for myositis (CAT) were performed at baseline and follow-up to assess treatment response, showing remarkable progressive improvement that persists over time, even after B-cell recovery.


CONCLUSIONS
This JDM patient with severe chronic disease, refractory to multiple treatments, achieved sustained B-cell depletion and ongoing immunosuppressive drug-free clinical and radiological improvement eight months after a single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells.">

        <tr id="e19527 Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant plasma cells. Bispecific T Cell engagers (BiTEs) are a novel class of drugs currently assessed in the setting of relapsed/refractory MM. BiTEs are designed to target specific antigenic epitopes on the surface of plasma cells and CD3 on T cells. The plasma cell targets include B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), G protein coupled receptor, class C, group 5, member D (GPRC5D) and Fc receptor homolog 5 (FcRH5). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature including abstracts and full publications using PubMed/Scopus through Dec 31, 2023. We found 23 studies which include BCMA agents: teclistamab (Tec), elranatamab, linvoseltamab, pavurutamab, and alnuctamab; and non-BCMA targets including: GPRC5D, talquetamab (Tal) and FcRH5, cevostamab, as well as combination therapies including a BiTE, specifically Tec+Tal and Tal+daratumumab (Tal+D). A pooled analysis based on the Welch's test was then performed on all BiTEs to compare the safety profile of each agent. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was also applied to cluster 23 BiTEs based on their AEs. Results: We found a cohort of 1899 patients with MM across 23 studies. 1094 individuals underwent treatment involving BCMAs. 677 were subjected to non-BCMA anti-agents. 65 participants received Tec + Tal and 63 patients received Tal+D. The median follow-up duration for both BCMA BiTE and non-BCMA BiTE groups extended to 9 and 14 months. When analyzing hematological AEs of any grade, neutropenia and anemia affected 44% of patients and lymphopenia 40%. Respiratory infections manifested in 44%. CRS (Cytokine Release Syndrome) was reported in 64%. Dysgeusia was reported in only non-BCMA at 53%. Grade 3+ AEs were as follows: neutropenia at 40%, infections at 18%, CRS at 2%, anemia at 28%, and lymphopenia at 45%. Upon conducting a comprehensive pooled analysis, subtle disparities emerged between BCMA and non-BCMA BiTEs. More instances of CRS and CRS with Tocilizumab occurred with BCMA BiTEs vs non-BCMA BiTes, P < 0.024. Friedman's findings emphasized substantial distinctions between BCMA and non-BCMA agents for both overall and severe G3+ AEs (p < 0.0001). t-SNE was applied to examine the clustering patterns among agents across all grades and grades 3+ AEs. The findings revealed that agents with all grades and grades 3+ showed similar clustering patterns except for one agent. Conclusions: The use of BiTEs in MM has demonstrated remarkable efficacy; however, these have been linked to a unique AE profile. Our results showed that non-BCMA were associated with less hematotoxicity (combined G3+ AEs and hypogammaglobulinemia), whereas BCMA BiTEs were associated with less CRS rates. This is important information for treatment selection and mitigation strategy development aiming to optimize patient outcomes.">

B cell depletion therapy with rituximab is effective in most patients with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) but requires repeated cycles to prevent disease flares. We here aimed to assess B cells after rituximab to predict relapse of IgG4-RD and guide retreatment.


METHODS
Patients with active IgG4-RD included in this retrospective study fulfilled the ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria. Total CD19+ B cells, plasmablasts, naïve and memory B cells were measured on peripheral blood by flow-cytometry at baseline and six months after rituximab. All patients were treated with two 1 g infusions of rituximab 15 days apart and monitored for 48 months. Disease response was assessed using the IgG4-RD Responder Index.


RESULTS
Thirty-three patients were included. Six months after rituximab, disease response was observed in all patients. Complete depletion of CD19+ B cells, plasmablasts, naïve and memory B cell depletion was achieved in 30%, 55%, 39%, and 42% of cases, respectively. Twenty-three relapses (70%) were observed at a median time of 24 months after rituximab. Relapse rate was significantly higher in patients who failed to achieve complete depletion of CD19+ cells (60% vs 17%, p= 0.02), naïve B cells (54% vs 15%, p= 0.01), or memory B cells (50% vs 16%, p= 0.03) six months after rituximab. The median relapse free survival time was shorter in patients who failed to achieve complete depletion of CD19+ cells (19 vs 38 months, p= 0.02), naïve B cells (16 vs 38 months, p= 0.01), or memory B cells (19 vs 38 months, p= 0.03) six months after rituximab.


CONCLUSIONS
The degree of B cell depletion six months after rituximab may predict disease flare and may instruct on the pacing of B cell depletion therapy in IgG4-RD.">

        <tr id="While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies, many patients relapse and therefore strategies to improve antitumor immunity are needed. We previously designed a novel autologous bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and CD22 (CAR19-22), which was well tolerated and associated with high response rates but relapse was common. Interleukin-15 (IL15) induces proliferation of diverse immune cells and can augment lymphocyte trafficking. Here, we report the results of a phase 1 clinical trial of the first combination of a novel recombinant polymer-conjugated IL15 receptor agonist (NKTR-255), with CAR19-22, in adults with relapsed / refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Eleven patients were enrolled, nine of whom successfully received CAR19-22 followed by NKTR-255. There were no dose limiting toxicities, with transient fever and myelosuppression as the most common possibly related toxicities. We observed favorable efficacy with eight out of nine patients (89%) achieving measurable residual disease negative remission. At 12 months, progression-free survival for NKTR-255 was double that of historical controls (67% vs 38%). We performed correlative analyses to investigate the effects of IL15 receptor agonism. Cytokine profiling showed significant increases in IL15 and the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. The increase in chemokines was associated with decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts and CD8+ CAR T-cells in blood and ten-fold increases in CSF CAR-T cells, suggesting lymphocyte trafficking to tissue. Combining NKTR-255 with CAR19-22 was safe, feasible and associated with high rates of durable responses (NCT03233854).">

        <tr id="7040 Background: CN201 is a novel CD19-targeting T-cell-engager IgG4 bispecific antibody, designed to reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) while retaining potent T-cell mediated cytotoxicities. A silenced Fc fragment was used to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity while prolonging half-life of the molecule. Here, we report results of the phase I study of CN201 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06189391). Methods: The i3+3 dose-escalation design was used in adult patients with CD19+ R/R B-NHL to investigate safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Patients with R/R DLBCL who failed≧2 prior lines of therapy, or R/R indolent NHL(iNHL) who had at least 1 prior systemic therapy were eligible for enrollment. Patients received CAR-T therapy can be enrolled after 90 days washout periord provided that CD19 was still positive on tumor cells. Response were evaluated according to the Lugano 2014 criteria. Single-agent CN201 was administered intravenously once per week. Intial dose escalation was conducted in the patients at fixed ascending doses; later, a step-up dosing regimen was adopted, including a priming dose on cycle 1 Day 1 followed by an intermediate dose on Day 8 and the target dose administered on Day 15 and thereafter. Results: As of December 29, 2023, 58 adult patients received CN201, including 19 patients with fixed doses from 2.5μg to 600μg, 39 patients with step-up doses from 1.2mg to 40mg of the target doses. Maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. The most common treatment-related adverse effects (AEs) (≥20%) of any grade were white blood cell decreased (32%), neutropenia (30%), lymphopenia (29%), anemia (29%), pyrexia (25%) and platelet decreased (23%). The most common AEs (≥10%) of grade 3 or higher were lymphopenia (24%) and neutropenia (14%). CRS occurred in 4 (7%) patients, mainly occurred following the first dose. All of those CRS were low-grade, no ≥Grade 3. No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was observed. In patients with fixed doses up to 600 μg and target dose up to 2.5mg, stable diseases (SD) were observed. The best overall responses dramatically improved in patients received full doses ≥ 5mg, ranging from 5 mg to 40 mg investigated so far. Among 22 evaluable patients with full doses ≥ 5mg, the objective response rate (ORR) was 77% and the complete remission (CR) rate was 22%. Among 11 patients with indolent B-NHL, the ORR was 91%, CR rate was 45.5%, including one patient had failed previous CAR-T therapy. The responses at higher doses are still under evaluation, and additional data will be reported. Conclusions: CN201 has a well tolerable safety profile and promising anti-tumor activity in patients with R/R B-NHL. Clinical trial information: NCT06189391 .">

        <tr id="B cells have a pivotal function in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In autoimmune disease, B cells orchestrate antigen presentation, cytokine production and autoantibody production, the latter via their differentiation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells. This article addresses the current therapeutic strategies to deplete B cells in order to ameliorate or potentially even cure autoimmune disease. It addresses the main target antigens in the B-cell lineage that are used for therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, it summarises the current evidence for successful treatment of autoimmune disease with monoclonal antibodies targeting B cells and the limitations and challenges of these approaches. Finally, the concept of deep B-cell depletion and immunological reset by chimeric antigen receptor T cells is discussed, as well as the lessons from this approach for better understanding the role of B cells in autoimmune disease.">

        <tr id="6505 Background: Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) still need more and better treatment options. CN201 is a novel CD19-targeting T-cell-engaging IgG4 bispecific antibody. This phase I study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CN201 in B-ALL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05579132). The data from the dose escalation and expansion of the ongoing study is presented. Methods: The study is enrolling patients with B-ALL who are refractory to primary induction therapy or to salvage therapy, or relapse. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive after two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were eligible. Single-agent CN201 was administered intravenously once per week with a step-up dose approach during cycle 1, a priming dose on Day 1 followed by an intermediate dose on Day 8 and the target dose administered on Day 15 and thereafter. The patients will receive 2 cycles of CN201 for induction. Responders will continue to receive a further 3 cycles for consolidation, and up to an additional 7 cycles for maintenance treatment or until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Results: As of January 31, 2024, 42 adult patients received CN201 with full dose from 600 μg to 40mg. 37 patients were evaluable for efficacy (Table1). Maximum tolerated dose has not reached. The most common adverse events (≥20%) of grade 3 or higher were leukopenia (47.6%), lymphopenia (42.9%), neutropenia (38%), thrombopenia (33.3%) , anaemia (26.2%). 6 patients (14.3%) had infections of grade 3 or higher. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 13 (30.9%) patients, mainly occurred following the first dose, most were low-grade, except for one patient with grade 3. No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was observed. Overall, 11 (30%) of 37 patients had complete remission (CR), 1 (2.7%) patient had complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi), 75% of responders had MRD negativity. The CR rate significantly increased with dose descalation, reached 50% (4 of 8 patients) with 10mg target dose, two of those occurred within the first two weeks following CN201 treatment. Among those responders, 100% were MRD negative. The CR rate in patients with higher dose levels are under investigation. Conclusions: Preliminary data show CN201 has a well tolerable safety profile and promising activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Clinical trial information: NCT05579132 .

        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell Engagers (TCEs) are promising anti-cancer treatments that bind to both the CD3 receptors on T cells and an antigen on the surface of tumor cells, creating an immune synapse, leading to killing of malignant tumor cells. These novel therapies have unique development challenges, with specific safety risks of cytokine release syndrome. These on-target adverse events fortunately can be mitigated and deconvoluted from efficacy via innovative dosing strategies, making clinical pharmacology key in the development of these therapies. This review assesses dose selection and the role of quantitative clinical pharmacology in the development of the first eight approved TCEs. Model informed drug development (MIDD) strategies can be used at every stage to guide TCE development. Mechanistic modeling approaches allow for (1) efficacious yet safe first-in-human dose selection as compared with in vitro minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) approach; (2) rapid escalation and reducing number of patients with subtherapeutic doses through model-based adaptive design; (3) virtual testing of different step-up dosing regimens that may not be feasible to be evaluated in the clinic; and (4) selection and justification of the optimal clinical step-up and full treatment doses. As the knowledge base around TCEs continues to grow, the relevance and utilization of MIDD strategies for supporting the development and dose optimization of these molecules are expected to advance, optimizing the benefit-risk profile for cancer patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Novel T-cell immunotherapies such as bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are emerging as promising therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer. BiTEs are engineered bispecific antibodies containing two distinct binding domains that allow for concurrent binding to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as well as immune effector cells, thus promoting an immune response against cancer cells. Prostate cancer is rich in tumor associated antigens such as, but not limited to, PSMA, PSCA, hK2, and STEAP1 and there is strong biologic rationale for employment of T-cell redirecting BiTEs within the prostate cancer disease space. Early generation BiTE constructs employed in clinical study have demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity, but challenges related to drug delivery, immunogenicity, and treatment-associated adverse effects limited their success. The ongoing development of novel BiTE constructs continues to address these barriers and to yield promising results in terms of efficacy and safety. This review will highlight some of most recent developments of BiTE therapies for patients with advanced prostate cancer and the evolving data surrounding BiTE constructs undergoing clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="This article endeavors to navigate the clinical journey of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), from elucidating common toxicities and management strategies to examining novel agents and broadening access in community health care. These drugs, commonly through T-cell activation, result in shared adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Variations in target antigens and designs, however, might introduce unique toxicities for different BsAbs, warranting specific management approaches. Recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals of BsAbs targeting CD3+ T cells linked to CD20 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and to B-cell maturation antigen or GPRC5D for multiple myeloma have transformed the treatment landscape for hematologic malignancies. Emerging new agents promise further enhancement and safety, exploring novel antigen targets, innovative structures such as trispecific antibodies, and the engagement of diverse immune cells. Simultaneously, the expansion of BsAbs into community practices is underway, demanding a multifaceted strategy that encompasses educational initiatives, operational adaptations, and collaborative frameworks. This ensures comprehensive treatment access, allowing every patient, irrespective of geographical or socioeconomic status, to benefit from these advancements in cancer therapy.">

The dramatic response encompasses objective improvement across multiple clinical domains as well as seroconversion. Side effects of concern with CAR-T cell therapy are related to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The reported side effects of this therapy for autoimmune diseases were of low grade and were managed without any fatality. Several modifications in CAR-T cell therapy have been proposed to maximize the safety and improving the efficacy. This therapy has got the potential to be a major breakthrough in management of rheumatic diseases, especially wherein existing therapies have been refractory.">

        <tr id="TPS2687 Background: CF33-CD19 is a novel chimeric vaccinia virus that selectively replicates in tumor cells and can provoke anti-tumor immunity. CF33-CD19 expresses a truncated and non-signaling CD19 protein on the surface of infected tumor cells before virus-mediated tumor lysis, labeling them for CD19-targeted therapies. Preclinical studies with CF33-CD19 have shown that combination therapy with CD19 targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cells is more effective than either monotherapy in murine xenograft and syngeneic models [1]. Likewise, combination therapy with bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE)s that bind CD3-positive T cells and infected solid tumor cells that express de novo CD19, showed pronounced recruitment of T cells to the tumor microenvironment, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in mouse models. CD19xCD3 targeting BiTEs such as blinatumomab may offer an off-the-shelf alternative to adoptive cell therapies. This phase I study, called OASIS, dose escalates CF33-CD19 administered intravenously (IV) or intratumorally (IT) combined with blinatumomab in adults with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Methods: The OASIS study (NCT06063317) is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. Patients who have received prior treatment with a poxvirus based oncolytic virus or a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager are excluded. A safety run-in will evaluate the safety of CF33-CD19 monotherapy administered IT or IV before initiating the combination therapy regimen. Combination therapy will be administered in 28-day cycles with CF33-CD19 on days 1 and 15. Following viral transduction to promote de novo CD19 expression, blinatumomab is given on days 2-9 and 16-23 via a 7-day continuous infusion. Patients > 45 kg will receive 9 mcg of blinatumomab during the first week of cycle 1, then 28 mcg during the third week of cycle 1 and subsequent cycles. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 follows a 3+3 dose escalation scheme independently of each route of CF33-CD19 administration (IT and IV) with dose levels of CF33-CD19 ranging from 1.0x107 to 3.0x109 PFU. Part 2 is a cohort expansion in select indications at the optimal dose. The co-primary endpoints are safety and identification of the recommended phase 2 dose.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The management of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) has witnessed dramatic changes in the recent past. Despite the availability of multiple novel immunotherapies in R/R setting, there remains an unmet need for off-the-shelf therapies, particularly in patients with primary refractory, multiply relapsed disease or those experiencing cellular immunotherapy failure. To harness the power of the T-cell mediated immunity, a novel class of drugs called bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have been developed. These BsAbs are currently under investigation both in frontline and R/R setting and hold the potential to revolutionize the management of LBCL.


AREAS COVERED
This review article summarizes the currently available BsAbs, their mode of action, efficacy, and safety data for untreated and R/R LBCL. In addition, the role of these BsAbs in combination with currently available chemoimmunotherapy regimens is also discussed.


EXPERT OPINION
Two bispecific antibodies have secured FDA approval for R/R LBCL, with expected approval of more BsAbs (including in earlier treatment lines). These drugs provide a highly efficacious and relatively safe treatment option for patients with highly pre-treated disease including relapse after cellular immunotherapies. In addition, these BsAbs provide a platform for chemotherapy-free regimen for older/frail patients.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignant plasma cell diseases, the incidence of which is increasing year by year. The application of immunomodulators drugs, proteasome inhibitors, anti-CD38 antibodies, CAR-T, and HSCT have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with MM, however new therapeutic tools need to be developed to improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory after conventional regimens treatment. Bispecific antibodies are a novel immunotherapeutic approach that generates immune synapses by binding to targets on malignant plasma cells and cytotoxic immune effector cells (T cells/natural killer cells), leading to T/NK cells activation and malignant plasma cell lysis. Several preclinical and phase I clinical studies have shown good efficacy, bringing new possibilities for patients with relapsed/refractory MM to improve their prognosis in the future in combination with the rest of the treatment options. This article summarizes the classification of bispecific antibodies developed in recent years, and the results of preclinical and clinical trials, which will provide some reference for treating MM.">

        <tr id="e14509 Background: B7-H3 (CD276) is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in solid tumors but with limited expression in normal tissues. Its presence is strongly associated with the inhibition of T-cell activity, cancer progression, and invasion. Furthermore, B7-H3 is strongly associated with poor prognosis and reduced patient survival. Given its crucial role in tumor biology, B7-H3 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for drug development. We utilized ExMab heterodimer platform and common light chain technology to develop EX105, a next-generation B7-H3×CD3 bispecific antibody. This innovative T-cell engager exhibits excellent anti-tumor activity in mouse models and good safety profile in NHP tox study. Methods: EX105 was generated using ExMab heterodimer platform and common light chain technology to form a heterodimeric IgG1 structure. Preclinical pharmacology studies, efficacy, and safety were evaluated. Anti-tumor activity study of EX105 includes in vitro T-cell cytotoxicity assays and in vivo PBMC reconstituted xenograft mice models. Preclinical safety evaluation of EX105 was performed through GLP single-dose and repeat-dose tox studies in non-human primates (NHPs). Results: Based on ELISA and FACS analyses, EX105 can bind to both human and cynomolgus monkey B7-H3 and CD3 antigens. Furthermore, SPR data suggest that EX105 exhibits a high affinity to B7-H3 and a much lower affinity to CD3. In consistent with that, EX105 only induced relatively low cytokine release. Nevertheless, EX105 showed a potent in vitro T cell cytotoxicity against B7-H3+ tumor cell lines. The in vivo anti-tumor activity of EX105 was further determined in several tumor xenograft models. Treatment with EX105 resulted in remarkable tumor regression in both “hot” tumor model and “cold” tumor model, indicating its effectiveness across a range of tumor types. Tox study in NHPs showed minimal adverse effects and no liver impairment after EX105 administration, even at high doses. The cytokine release data observed in this study suggests a good safety profile of EX105, with much lower cytokine release compared to other T cell engagers. Conclusions: These findings collectively indicate that EX105 has the potential to become a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various B7-H3 positive cancers. The first-in-human clinical trial for patients with advanced B7-H3 positive cancers is due to start.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) presents a significant global health burden, with disparities in incidence and outcomes reflecting challenges in recognition and treatment. Talquetamab, a bispecific CD3 T-cell engager targeting G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), has emerged as a promising immunotherapy for relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). In August 2023, talquetamab received accelerated approval from the US FDA for RRMM treatment, followed by conditional marketing authorization from the EMA. Clinical trials demonstrated talquetamab's efficacy, with overall response rates (ORR) of 69% and 76% in heavily pretreated RRMM patients. The phase I monumenTAL-1 trial showcased talquetamab's effectiveness, particularly in high-risk MM and extramedullary disease, with ORRs around 71-74%. Subsequent phase 2 results reaffirmed its efficacy, even in patients with prior T-cell redirection therapies. Combination therapy with daratumumab further enhanced talquetamab's efficacy, addressing concerns of T cell exhaustion. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed sustained responses and manageable adverse events with subcutaneous administration, facilitating convenient dosing regimens. However, talquetamab carries risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity, necessitating close monitoring and prompt management. Common adverse events included fever, CRS, musculoskeletal pain, and infections, although severe events were infrequent. Vigilant management strategies, including prophylactic measures and supportive care, mitigate these risks. In conclusion, talquetamab represents a significant advancement in RRMM treatment, offering a promising avenue for T-cell redirection therapy. Ongoing research aims to optimize treatment sequencing and combination strategies, fostering improved outcomes for MM patients. Continued investigation will refine the strategic integration of talquetamab and other immunotherapies, paving the way for enhanced treatment efficacy and patient care in RRMM.">

        <tr id="7532  Background: ABBV-383 is a BCMA x CD3 bispecific antibody with 2 high-affinity BCMA-binding domains and a low-affinity CD3 engaging arm that has been shown to decrease the negative impact of soluble BCMA (sBCMA) and drive sustained T-cell activation with reduced cytokine release in preclinical models of MM. Here, we describe correlative biomarker results of baseline and longitudinal sBCMA levels and immune profiles in the ongoing first-in-human trial that supports 60 mg Q4W as the optimal therapeutic dose of ABBV-383 monotherapy. Methods: Peripheral blood and serum samples from patients with RRMM enrolled in the phase 1 open-label, dose-expansion study (NCT03933735) who received ABBV-383 at 20, 40, or 60 mg Q3W or 60 mg Q4W were collected at baseline (post-dexamethasone, pre–ABBV-383), on treatment, and at disease progression. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for immune cell populations, Luminex for cytokines, and electrochemiluminescence ligand binding for sBCMA. Results: Median sBCMA levels at baseline were highly variable among patients, but did not associate with clinical response (≥ partial response [PR]) to ABBV-383 at the selected optimal dose level of 60 mg Q4W (<PR: 244.7 ng/mL; ≥PR: 52.2 ng/mL; P=0.13). Reduction in sBCMA levels over time associated with clinical response (Cmin at cycle 5: <PR, 244.7 ng/mL; ≥PR, 4.7 ng/mL; P=0.04). ABBV-383 treatment led to a rapid and transient increase of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α (Cmax within cycle 1: 29, 349.5, 1375, 456.5 pg/mL, respectively), and promoted T-cell redistribution (89% reduction of CD8+ T cells from periphery), activation (1.9-fold increase in CD69+CD8+ T cells), and proliferation (2-fold increase in Ki67+CD8+ T cells) within cycle 1 in 60-mg Q4W-treated patients. The frequency of baseline CD8+ T-cell exhaustion (PD-1/TIM3) did not impact clinical response at the optimal dose level of 60 mg Q4W ABBV-383 (<PR: 3.5%; ≥PR: 3.9%; P=0.9). Peak induction levels of proinflammatory cytokines during cycle 1 correlated with occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (≥G1) as well as clinical response across dose levels. Conclusions: High-avidity BCMA binding coupled to low-affinity T-cell engagement distinguishes the resulting mechanism of action for ABBV-383. Responses to 60 mg Q4W ABBV-383 were independent of baseline sBCMA levels and resulted in rapid and transient proinflammatory cytokine production that promoted robust T-cell redistribution, activation, and proliferation, indicating that the optimal dose of ABBV-383 maximizes its clinical potential as a convenient, safe, and effective therapy for MM.

        <tr id="Bispecific antibodies, by enabling the targeting of more than one disease-associated antigen or engaging immune effector cells, have both advantages and challenges compared with a combination of two different biological products. As of December 2023, there are 11 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved BsAb products on the market. Among these, 9 have been approved for oncology indications, and 8 of these are CD3 T-cell engagers. Clinical pharmacology strategies, including dose-related strategies, are critical for bispecific antibody development. This analysis reviewed clinical studies of all approved bispecific antibodies in oncology and identified dose-related perspectives to support clinical dose optimization and regulatory approvals, particularly in the context of the Food and Drug Administration's Project Optimus: (1) starting doses and dose ranges in first-in-human studies; (2) dose strategies including step-up doses or full doses for recommended phase 2 doses or dose level(s) used for registrational intent; (3) restarting therapy after dose delay; (4) considerations for the introduction of subcutaneous doses; (5) body weight vs. flat dosing strategy; and (6) management of immunogenicity.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a new and effective treatment for patients with hematologic malignancies. Clinical responses to CAR T cells in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma have provided strong evidence of the antitumor activity of these cells. In patients with refractory or relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the infusion of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells is rapidly gaining standard-of-care status and might eventually be incorporated into frontline treatment. In T-ALL, however, leukemic cells generally lack surface molecules recognized by established CAR, such as CD19 and CD22. Such deficiency is particularly important, as outcome is dismal for patients with T-ALL that is refractory to standard chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recently, CAR T-cell technologies directed against T-cell malignancies have been developed and are beginning to be tested clinically. The main technical obstacles stem from the fact that malignant and normal T cells share most surface antigens. Therefore, CAR T cells directed against T-ALL targets might be susceptible to self-elimination during manufacturing and/or have suboptimal activity after infusion. Moreover, removing leukemic cells that might be present in the cell source used for CAR T-cell manufacturing might be problematic. Finally, reconstitution of T cells and natural killer cells after CAR T-cell infusion might be impaired. In this article, we discuss potential targets for CAR T-cell therapy of T-ALL with an emphasis on CD7, and review CAR configurations as well as early clinical results.">

        <tr id="6534 Background: CD19-targeted therapies have shown remarkable efficacy in patients with B-cell malignancies. However, relapse with CD19 loss as a mechanism of tumor escape is common and represents a serious challenge. Patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior CD19-directed therapy have limited salvage options and a very poor prognosis. The B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) is functionally expressed in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including in patients with CD19-negative relapse (Qin et al., Sci Transl Med. 2019). As a critical regulator of B-cell function and survival, BAFF-R may be less prone to downregulation by tumors as a mechanism of antigen escape. Methods: We are conducting two phase 1 clinical trials of BAFFR-CAR T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-ALL (NCT04690595) and NHL (NCT05370430). Primary endpoints are dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and all other toxicities. Secondary endpoints include response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, PFS and OS. Response is evaluated using European LeukemiaNet criteria for B-ALL and Lugano 2014 for NHL. Results: As of Feb. 1st, 2024, 1 B-ALL and 3 NHL patients have completed treatment and post-treatment evaluations. Each received 50M BAFFR CAR T cells (starting dose level in both trials). The B-ALL patient had CD19/CD20/CD22-negative disease, and had received prior blinatumomab. NHL patients #1 and #2 both had CD19-expressing mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and had received prior CD19 CAR T cells. Patient #2 had also received a CD3/CD20 bispecific antibody. NHL patient #3 had CD19/CD20-negative T cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRBCL) and had not received prior CD19 CAR T cells. There were no DLTs, all patients had Gr. 1 cytokine release syndrome, and 2/3 NHL patients had Gr. 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Robust CAR T cell expansion was seen in all patients with a peak on days 12-14 post-infusion. The B-ALL and the 2 MCL patients reached MRD-negative complete response (CR) at 1 month post-treatment. The THRBCL patient had partial response (PR) at 1 month that converted to CR at 3 months. The B-ALL patient successfully transitioned to allogeneic HCT while in CR at 3 months post-infusion. Responses are ongoing in all NHL patients at 14, 10, and 8 months for patients #1, #2 and #3, respectively. Additional patients have been enrolled at the next dose level (200M CAR T cells). Results for these patients will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: With a 100% CR rate at 3 months in the first 4 patients and durable responses at dose level 1, BAFFR-CAR T cells are a promising therapeutic option for patients with r/r B-cell malignancies who are ineligible or failed prior CD19-targeted therapy, including with CD19 antigen loss.

        <tr id="Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive malignancy that has historically been associated with a very poor prognosis. Despite large co-operative international trials and incremental increases in intensity of therapy, there has been no significant improvement in outcome over the last 3 decades. Using representative cases, we highlight the key differences between KMT2A-rearranged and KMT2A-germline infant ALL, and how advances in molecular diagnostics are unpicking KMT2A-germline genetics and guiding treatment reduction. We focus on KM2TA-rearranged infant B-cell ALL where the last few years have seen the emergence of novel therapies which both are more effective and less toxic than conventional chemotherapy. Of these, there is promising early data on the efficacy and tolerability of the bi-specific T-cell engager monoclonal antibody, blinatumomab, as well as the use of autologous and allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. We discuss how we can improve risk stratification and incorporate these new agents to replace the most toxic elements of currently deployed intensive chemotherapy schedules with their associated unacceptable toxicity.">

        <tr id="Objectives Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) maintains peripheral immune tolerance by preventing T cell continuous activation. Aiming to understand the extent of PD-1 expression in inflammatory arthritis beyond its involvement with T cells, we assess its presence on various circulating single cells. Methods Mass cytometry analysis of patients with active seropositive/seronegative rheumatoid (RA; n=9/8) and psoriatic (PsA; n=9) arthritis versus healthy controls (HC; n=13), re-evaluating patients after 3 months of anti-rheumatic treatment. Results PD-1 was expressed in all leukocyte subpopulations, with the highest PD-1+ cell frequencies in eosinophils (59-73%) and T cells (50–60%), and the lowest in natural-killer cells (1–3%). PD-1+ cell frequencies and PD-1 median expression were comparable between patient subgroups and HC, in the majority of cell subsets. Exceptions included increases in certain T cell/B cell subsets of seropositive RA and specific monocyte subsets and dendritic cells of PsA; an expanded PD-1+CD4+CD45RA+CD27+CD28+ T subset, denoting exhausted T cells, was common across patient subgroups. Strikingly, significant inverse correlations between individual biomarkers of systemic inflammation (ESR and/or serum CRP) and PD-1+ cell frequencies and/or median expression were evident in several innate and adaptive immunity cell subsets of RA and PsA patients. Furthermore, all inverse correlations noted in individuals with active arthritis were no longer discernible in those who attained remission/low disease activity post-treatment. Conclusion PD-1 expression may be insufficient, relative to the magnitude of the concomitant systemic inflammatory response on distinct leukocyte subsets, varying between RA and PsA. Our results point to the potential therapeutic benefits of pharmacological PD-1 activation, to rebalance the autoimmune response and reduce inflammation.">

        <tr id="Objectives This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCMA-CD19 compound chimeric antigen receptor T cells (cCAR) to dual reset the humoral and B cell immune system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis (LN). Methods This is a single-arm open-label multicentre phase 1 study of BCMA and CD19-directed cCAR in patients suffering from SLE/LN with autoantibodies produced by B cells and plasma/long-lived plasma cells. In this clinical trial, we sequentially assigned biopsy-confirmed (classes III–V) LN patients to receive 3×106 cCAR cells/kg postcessation of all SLE medications and conditioning. The primary endpoint of safety and toxicity was assessed. Complete immune reset was indicated by B cell receptor (BCR) deep sequencing and flow cytometry analysis. Patient 11 (P11) had insufficient lymphocyte counts and was underdosed as compassionate use. Results P1 and P2 achieved symptom and medication-free remission (MFR) from SLE and complete remission from lymphoma. P3–P13 (excluding P11) received an initial dose of 3×106 cCAR cells /kg and were negative for all autoantibodies, including those derived from long-lived plasma cells, 3 months post-cCAR and the complement returned to normal levels. These patients achieved symptom and MFR with post-cCAR follow-up to 46 months. Complete recovery of B cells was seen in 2–6 months post-cCAR. Mean SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 reduced from 10.6 (baseline) to 2.7 (3 months), and renal function significantly improved in 10 LN patients ≤90 days post-cCAR. cCAR T therapy was well tolerant with mild cytokine-release syndrome. Conclusions Data suggest that cCAR therapy was safe and effective in inducing MFR and depleting disease-causing autoantibodies in patients with SLE.">

        <tr id="Objectives B-cell depletion time after rituximab (RTX) treatment is prolonged in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) compared with other autoimmune diseases. We investigated central and peripheral B-cell development to identify the causes for the defect in B-cell reconstitution after RTX therapy. Methods We recruited 91 patients with AAV and performed deep phenotyping of the peripheral and bone marrow B-cell compartment by spectral flow and mass cytometry. B-cell development was studied by in vitro modelling and the role of BAFF receptor by quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and in vitro assays. Results Treatment-naïve patients with AAV showed low transitional B-cell numbers, suggesting impaired B-lymphopoiesis. We analysed bone marrow of treatment-naïve and RTX-treated patients with AAV and found reduced B-lymphoid precursors. In vitro modelling of B-lymphopoiesis from AAV haematopoietic stem cells showed intact, but slower and reduced immature B-cell development. In a subgroup of patients, after RTX treatment, the presence of transitional B cells did not translate in replenishment of naïve B cells, suggesting an impairment in peripheral B-cell maturation. We found low BAFF-receptor expression on B cells of RTX-treated patients with AAV, resulting in reduced survival in response to BAFF in vitro. Conclusions Prolonged depletion of B cells in patients with AAV after RTX therapy indicates a B-cell defect that is unmasked by RTX treatment. Our data indicate that impaired bone marrow B-lymphopoiesis results in a delayed recovery of peripheral B cells that may be further aggravated by a survival defect of B cells. Our findings contribute to the understanding of AAV pathogenesis and may have clinical implications regarding RTX retreatment schedules and immunomonitoring after RTX therapy.">

        <tr id="TPS2672 Background: LAVA-1207 is a humanized bispecific antibody that binds with high affinity to the Vδ2 chain of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). It comprises a heterodimer of two fusion proteins, each consisting of a VHH linked to a human IgG1 Fc domain. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that, upon binding both targets, LAVA-1207 leads to potent Vγ9Vδ2-T cell degranulation and cytolytic activity against PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells. IL-2 is an immune modulator which has been shown to support expansion of activated Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. PD-1 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor that can dampen (Vγ9Vδ2-) T cell reactivity, suggesting that pembrolizumab could potentiate the effect of LAVA-1207. Methods: This trial is a phase 1/2a open label study with a 3+3 design in patients with refractory mCRPC to assess the safety of LAVA-1207 alone or with low dose IL-2 or with pembrolizumab, and to determine the recommended Phase 2a dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives include evaluation of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity. Exploratory endpoints include evaluation of the effect of study treatment on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). LAVA-1207 is administered IV every two weeks. Two parallel cohorts assessing LAVA-1207 with low dose subcutaneous IL-2 have been implemented: (1) single IL-2 administration and (2) three IL-2 administrations on consecutive days per cycle for up to four cycles. An additional dose escalation arm evaluates LAVA-1207 in combination with pembrolizumab, 400mg Q6W, IV. Patients with mCRPC that have failed at least one prior AR therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy (unless deemed medically unsuitable to receive a taxane) will be enrolled on the study. Patients should have progressive disease either by PSA or by RECIST 1.1 or appearance of 2 or more bone metastases. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-1. PSMA-PET is performed at baseline. Paired biopsies are requested to further assess LAVA-1207 activity. Dose escalation is ongoing. Expansion arm(s) will be included based on available data from part 1 of the study and may include one or more of LAVA-1207, LAVA-1207 with low dose IL-2, or LAVA-1207 in combination with pembrolizumab.

        <tr id="7030 Background: The therapeutic landscape for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is evolving to include targeted T-cell based immunotherapies, including CD19-targeted CAR-T and CD3xCD20 T-cell engaging (TCE) bispecific antibodies. Yet, there remains an unmet medical need for patients who are refractory to, or ineligible for these treatments. Leveraging natural killer (NK) cells emerges as a promising strategy in hematological malignancies, as shown in a Phase 1 study with IPH6101/SAR’579 in R/R AML (Stein, ASCO 2023; Bajel, ASH 2023). Methods: We developed IPH6501, a tetraspecific antibody-based NK cell engager that simultaneously targets on NK cells the CD16a and NKp46 receptors, the IL-2 receptor with an engineered IL-2 variant (IL2v) and on B-NHL cells the CD20 antigen. This approach boosts NK cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, and cytokine production. The IL-2 variant is designed with mutations that prevent binding to CD25 (IL-2Rα), limiting Treg activation and potential IL-2-related side effects. IPH6501 has been evaluated in mouse, non-human primate, and human-derived models, including cells from R/R B-NHL patients. Results: In vivo studies in non-human primates and tumor mouse models revealed that IPH6501, at well-tolerated doses, significantly boosted peripheral NK cell proliferation, drove their accumulation at tumor locations, and effectively eradicated CD20+ cells in blood and tissues. In human derived-models, IPH6501 significantly induced NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Notably, IPH6501 showed potent activity against a range of B-NHL cell lines, including those with low CD20 expression. In addition, IPH6501 upregulated the expression of activating receptors on NK cells, such as NKG2D, essential for the recognition and killing of malignant cells, thereby introducing another mode of action enabling the elimination of CD20-negative tumor cells. In a comparative analysis with a CD3xCD20 TCE, IPH6501 induced lower cytokine secretion, suggesting a potentially safer profile. Additionally, IPH6501 showed higher killing efficacy compared to the TCE in samples from healthy individuals as well as R/R B-NHL patients, underscoring its therapeutic potential. Conclusions: The preclinical demonstrations of IPH6501 activities across various in vivo models and its effectiveness in ex vivo assays using cells from R/R B-NHL patients provide compelling evidence of its therapeutic potential and tolerability. IPH6501 is emerging as a promising new candidate within the treatment landscape for R/R B-NHL and is currently being investigated in a global, first-in-human phase 1/2 study (NCT 06088654).">

        <tr id="7022 Background: T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody (TCB) had emerged as a promising therapy for blood malignancies, including relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-NHL. However, severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains to be a significant challenge in TCB treatment. To overcome this setback, we re-designed a new CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody (EX103) with a lower affinity to CD3. Clinical data from an ongoing first-in-human phase I/II study demonstrates that EX103 has an encouraging safety and promising single-agent antitumor activity in heavily pretreated R/R B-NHL patients. We present updated safety and efficacy data from the ongoing trial (CTR20212096). Methods: Eligible patients received EX103 with 3 step-up doses followed by target doses in 28-day cycles (iv, QW: cycle 1-2; Q2W thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At data cut off (Dec 24, 2023), a total of 23 patients were evaluated, including 18 patients in dose-escalation part and 5 patients in dose-expansion part. Results: Among 23 evaluable patients (median age: 51 years [range 42-70]; median prior lines of treatment: 4 [range 2-10]), 13 patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 4 had FL 1-3a, 2 had FL grade 3B, 1 had marginal zone lymphoma, 1 had mantle cell lymphoma, and 2 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Median time since last therapy was 2.5 (range 0.3-39.2) months. No DLT and treatment-related death were observed. CRS was the most common treatment related adverse event. All CRS events were grade (Gr) 1-2 (Gr 1: 78.3%, Gr 2: 13.0%), no Gr 3 or higher events. Most CRS events occurred in the first or second treatment cycle, and all CRS-related clinical symptoms were resolved within 48 hours. No cases of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome or other clinically significant neurologic AEs were observed. For dose ≥ 6 mg cohorts, the overall response rate (ORR) for aggressive B-NHL is 78.6% and the complete response (CR) rate is 50.0% (14 patients). Meanwhile, the ORR for indolent B-NHL is 100%, and CR rate is 25.0% (4 patients). The overall DCR is 89.5%. Currently, treatment is ongoing for 18 patients. The longest duration of response is 14 months. Patients who were refractory to previous therapies achieved impressive responses to EX103 treatment. 3 patients who failed CAR-T therapy achieved either CR or partial response (PR) (2 CR and 1 PR), 2 patients who failed CD19×CD3 bispecific antibody treatment both achieved PR, and 4 patients who failed ASCT achieved either CR or PR (2 CR and 2 PR). Conclusions: EX103 can induce deep and durable responses in heavily pretreated patients with R/R B-NHL, such as those patients who failed CAR-T treatment (3 cases), CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody treatment (2 cases) and ASCT (4 cases).

        <tr id="The treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma has improved substantially in the last 5–10 years based on the development and use of several novel classes of drugs and drug combinations. These advances have led to improvements in progression-free and overall survival as well as quality of life. The general tendency has been to advance drugs/combinations that have performed well in advanced disease to the earlier line settings (frontline, first/early relapse). There are several triplet drug combinations that, when used as part of first or early relapse, can provide remission durations of 3 years or longer. More recently, impressive responses have been seen with the use of targeted immunotherapeutics (chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and bispecific antibodies) in heavily pretreated patients with MM. These treatments, however, have been associated with some new and occasionally severe toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and severe infections, including opportunistic infections and profound cytopenias. These potential toxicities bring into question whether these immune-targeting drugs should remain as late-line therapeutics or whether the high single-agent overall response rates mandate that these agents be used in earlier line settings. Herein, the authors provide a point and counterpoint about the future use of these agents.">

        <tr id="7549 Background: While CART and BiTE have led to unprecedented responses in RRMM, some patients (pts) do not respond or have short-lived responses. Currently no predictive markers exist to identify these pts. This study explored pretreatment T-cell fitness and efficacy/toxicity in RRMM using a novel single-cell secretome analysis. We hypothesized that pretreatment Polyfunctional Strength Index (PSI) may predict efficacy to BCMA-directed T-cell therapies. Methods: We included 14 RRMM pts treated with idecabtagene vicleucel or teclistamab at Yale Cancer Center with ≥6 mos post-treatment follow-up. Peripheral blood prior to treatment was frozen and then PBMC’s thawed for analysis. PSI, a metric for T-cell fitness combining polyfunctional T-cells % with the intensity of secreted cytokines, was obtained using the IsoPlexis’ Single-Cell Secretome Platform. The overall PSI was an average of CD4+ and CD8+ PSIs. Response was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group criteria and response duration was defined as time from response to disease progression. Responder (R) was defined as ≥very good partial response for ≥6 mos. Non-responder (NR) was defined as stable or progressive disease ≤3 mos. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded using the American Society for Transplantation & Cellular Therapy system. Statistics were performed with Mann-Whitney U test using GraphPad PRISM v.9. Results: There were 7 pts in R group (2 BiTE & 5 CART) and 7 pts in NR group (3 BiTE & 4 CART). Median follow-up time was 13.5 mos(range, 7-27). Median age at treatment was 64 yrs in R and 63 yrs in NR. Extramedullary disease (EM) was present in 14.3%(n=1) in R and 71.4%(n=5) in NR. High-risk cytogenetics, defined as del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), 1q gain/amplification and del1p, were seen in 42.9%(n=3) in R and 85.7%(n=6) in NR. Median prior lines of therapy was 6(range, 4-9) in R and 8(range, 4-10) in NR. CRS/ICANS occurred 85.7%(n=6) in R and 28.6%(n=2) in NR. Overall PSI was 184 in R and 91 in NR(p=0.1649). CD4+ PSI was 160 in R and 75 in NR(p=0.1649). CD8+ PSI was 207 in R and 108 in NR(p=0.1981). Overall PSI was 143 in CRS/ICANS and 130 in no CRS/ICANS(p=0.7546). Conclusions: Overall PSI, CD4+ PSI and CD8+ PSI were 1.9-2.1 times higher in R compared to NR and overall PSI was slightly higher in CRS/ICANS compared to no CRS/ICANS though the difference was not statistically significant. One limitation was a small sample size and thus testing PSI in a larger cohort might yield statistically significant results. The NR group had more high-risk cytogenetics and higher EM. One confounder could be that measuring peripheral T-cell fitness may not be sufficient to predict response in EM where spatial determinants of T-cell influx play a role.">

        <tr id="Objective Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is an emerging and effective therapy for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). The characteristic toxicities of CAR T cell therapy include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and prolonged cytopenia. We investigated the factors associated with these complications after CAR T cell therapy by analyzing lymphocyte subsets following CAR T cell infusion. Methods We retrospectively analyzed peripheral blood samples on days 7, 14, and 28 after tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) infusion by flow cytometry at our institution between June 2020 and September 2022. Patients Thirty-five patients with R/R DLBCL who received tisa-cel therapy were included. Results A flow cytometry-based analysis of blood samples from these patients revealed that the proportion of CD4+CD25+CD127+ T cells (hereafter referred to as "activated CD4+ T cells" ) among the total CD4+ T cells on day 7 after tisa-cel infusion correlated with the duration of CRS (r=0.79, p<0.01). In addition, a prognostic analysis of the overall survival (OS) using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves indicated a significantly more favorable OS and progression-free survival of patients with a proportion of activated CD4+ T cells among the total CD4+ T cells <0.73 (p=0.01, and p<0.01, respectively). Conclusion These results suggest that the proportion of activated CD4+ T cells on day 7 after tisa-cel infusion correlates with the CRS duration and predicts clinical outcomes after CAR T cell therapy. Further studies with a larger number of patients are required to validate these observations.">

        <tr id="Autoimmunity is a pathological process associated with a violation of immunological tolerance to normal structural components of the body (autoantigens), associated with the predominance of active (adaptive) immunity and manifested by hyperproduction of autoantibodies. Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) are among the most common and severe nosological forms of this pathology associated with autoimmunity. Problems of pharmacotherapy of SARDs are the subject of intensive research. At the beginning of the 21st century, more than 20 biologic agents were developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis – monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recombinant proteins that control inflammation associated with the overproduction of “pro-inflammatory” cytokines, the use of which has dramatically improved the results of pharmacotherapy. However, much less research has been devoted to studying the possibilities of pharmacotherapy aimed at selective suppression of the “autoimmune” component of the pathogenesis of SADRs associated with uncontrolled activation of B cells and restoration of immunological tolerance to autoantigens. In the spectrum of drugs whose mechanism of action is associated with the suppression of pathological activation of B cells, the leading place is occupied by rituximab (RTM). It is noteworthy that 20 years ago (2004), a group of researchers led by prof. J.C. Edwards first demonstrated the effectiveness of RTM in patients with RA, which was soon successfully repositioned to treat a wide range of SARDs. A major achievement in the pharmacotherapy of SARDs is associated with the use of CAR (сhimeric antigen receptor) T cell therapy, developed for the treatment of refractory hematological tumors. The main component of CART-cells is a genetically engineered T-cell receptor that recognizes the target antigen without the participation of the major histocompatibility complex. Although limited, extremely impressive data regarding high remission rates have been obtained by adapting CD19 CART-cell therapy to treat patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other SARDs refractory to standard immunosuppressive medications. The article discusses the results of the use of CART-cell therapy in SLE and other SARDs and prospects for further research.">

        <tr id="The conventional clinical therapies for autoimmune diseases (ADs) lack specificity, necessitating long-term medication that can lead to serious side effects. In contrast, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for ADs, characterized by fewer side effects and longer-lasting therapeutic effects, represents a new direction for the specific treatment of ADs. T cells modified with CAR genes possess the ability to not only secrete perforin, granzymes, and other molecules that target autoreactive immune cells but also to lead effector and regulatory T cells into autoimmune environments, thereby exerting transport, proliferation, and immune regulatory functions. Chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells can recognize and kill autoreactive cells expressing target autoantibodies through their specific antigens. In this article, we comprehensively expound on the application of CAR-T cell therapy in different ADs and summarize the current research progress in this regard. This review aims to enhance the application of CAR-T therapy in AD treatment and facilitate further studies aimed at addressing the existing gaps in CAR-T therapy for ADs.">

        <tr id="Introduction and Objectives: In healthy individuals, activation and expansion of CD8 regulatory T cells (CD8 Treg) leads to selective killing of pathogenic CD4 T cells without broad immunosuppression. In patients with autoimmunity, CD8 Treg appear dysfunctional, allowing pathogenic CD4 T cell expansion and downstream inflammatory events, causing damage to healthy tissues. MTX-101 is a bispecific CD8 Treg modulator targeting CD8 and KIR2DL(1/2/3), co-expressed on CD8 Treg. MTX-101 targets CD8 Treg to restore their function and reduce inflammation without unwanted immune cell activation or global immune suppression. By targeting a root cause of CD4-driven autoimmune diseases, our data suggest that MTX-101 is a promising CD8 Treg-specific therapeutic to restore immune balance for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
 Methods: We evaluated MTX-101 binding, mechanism of action, and specificity in vitro using human PBMCs and in vivo using a human CD4 T cell-driven GVHD model. Pharmacology and early tolerability were evaluated in humanized CD34+-engrafted NSG(IL-15Tg) mice.
 Results: MTX-101 increased the activation and functions of CD8 Treg without activating other immune cells or affecting global immune responses in vitro, and improved outcomes in the acute GVHD model. In Balb/c and humanized mice, MTX-101 pharmacokinetics were consistent with antibody-like molecules. In humanized mice, MTX-101 bound CD8 Treg in peripheral blood and terminal tissues, with no resulting activation of immune cells. No induction of proinflammatory serum cytokines were observed following MTX-101 dosing at concentrations up to 50 mg/kg.
 Conclusion: MTX-101 restores CD8 Treg functions and may provide durable resistance to autoimmune disease progression.

        <tr id="2550 Background: Antigen-specific cancer immunotherapies, based on engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or the systemic administration of bispecific T cell-engagers (TCEs), have a significant impact on relapsed/refractory (R/R) B cell malignancies. However, a significant percentage of patients relapse following CAR-T or TCE therapy, with antigen loss accounting for up to one third of relapses/progressions. To avoid antigen loss after administration of single-targeted CAR-T cells and to minimize tumor escape, strategies targeting two antigens simultaneously have been developed and validated in both preclinical models and clinical trials. Nevertheless, despite lowering the risk of antigen loss, these strategies still have some limitations, mainly related to design and manufacturing challenges. Methods: In this context, we have generated the first dual-target strategy for hematological malignancies based on T cells bearing an anti-CD22 CAR and secreting an anti-CD19 T-cell engager antibody (CAR-STAb-T cells) and conducted a comprehensive preclinical study comparing its therapeutic potential with a previously validated anti-CD19/CD22 tandem CAR therapy (TanCAR-T) for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Results: We have demonstrated in both short- and long-term assays, using contact and non-contact co-culture systems, that CAR-STAb-T cells efficiently redirect bystander T cells, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic activity compared to that exhibited by TanCAR-T cells at very low E:T ratios. In addition, CAR-STAb-T cells induce more potent and faster cytotoxic responses than TanCAR-T cells in both short- and long-term co-culture assays when reproducing antigen-downmodulated conditions in vitro. In vivo assays conducted in NSG mice transplanted with a B-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX), followed by intravenous injection of CAR-STAb-T or TanCAR-T cells under a T cell-limiting experimental setting, also showed that CAR-STAb-T cells maintained a tighter control of tumor progression than TanCAR-T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the combination of a cell surface CAR and a soluble TCE recognizing different antigens may be advantageous over the use of conventional multi-targeted strategies based on cell surface-anchored receptors. Furthermore, we have proven that a small number of transduced CAR-STAb-T cells is sufficient to redirect non-transduced bystander T cells specifically and efficiently in the presence of leukemia cells, providing a significant advantage over current dual-targeted CAR-T cell therapies. CAR-STAb-T cells could therefore become an alternative to CAR-T therapies for the treatment of R/R B cell malignancies, especially in lymphodepleted patients with low T cell counts.">

        <tr id="6515 Background: Patients with relapsed/refractory T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (r/r T-ALL/LBL) are clinically manifested by rapid disease progression, poor prognosis and lack of therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to develop other effective modalities. Apart from its expression in normal T and NK cells and no expression in other tissue cells, CD7 is highly expressed in T-ALL/LBL cells. Therefore, CD7 is considered a potential target for the development of CAR-T therapy for T-ALL/LBL. The challenge, however, is to avoid fratricide caused by the expression of CD7 in T cells. We developed a CAR-T cell injection based on CD7 nano antibodies, named PA3-17 injection, by blocking the expression of CD7 molecule on the surface of T cells through anti-CD7 protein expression blocker (PEBL) and evaluate the safety, efficacy and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of PA3-17 Injection in patients with r/r T-ALL/LBL in a phase I clinical study. Methods: The clinical study (NCT05170568) adopted a "3+3" dose escalation schema and proceed cohort expansion. T-ALL/LBL patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were deployed by entering three dose groups (DL: 0.5×106, 2×106, 4×106 CAR-T/kg) to evaluate the initial safety, efficacy and dose-limited toxicities (DLTs). All patients were treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy pre-treatment before CAR-T cell infusion. The primary endpoints were DLTs and maximum tolerable dose (MTD). Results: As of Nov 28th, 2023, a total of 12 patients were enrolled (3 patients in dose 1, 2, 3 group, 3 patients in RP2D group), all of whom received a single infusion of PA3-17 injection and completed a 28- day DLTs assessment. The median age of enrolled patients was 33.5 years (range 20-64), and 25.0% (3/12) of patients had previously received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No DLTs occurred. The RP2D was 2×106 CAR-T/kg. The safety analysis showed that 83.3% (10/12) of patients developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS), of which 25% (3/12) had grade 3, and no grade 4 CRS occurred, 16.7% (2/12) of patients experienced 1-2 grade of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and no grade 3 or higher ICANS occurred. The efficacy data showed that the best ORR was 83.3% (10/12) and the CR rate was 75% (9/12). The median follow-up time was 213.5 days. Five patients (Pt 1/5/6/7/9) maintained CR for more than 6 months. One patient (Pt6) had a tumor mass with a diameter greater than 7cm at baseline prior CAR-T infusion but achieved CR 28 days after infusion, then she underwent transplantation at sixth month but died at eighth month because of heart problems, which is unrelated with PA3-17 infusion. Conclusions: PA3-17 injection has shown a good safety profile and encouraging efficacy in r/r T-ALL/LBL patients. RP2D has been determined and the key Phase II clinical study is about to begin.

        <tr id="2536 Background: While being efficient in hematological malignancies, bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), like CAR T cells, are not yet established in solid tumors. Moreover, all T cell-mobilizing strategies cause side effects that endanger patients and may limit applicable doses and thus efficacy. We report on the clinical development of CC-1, a PSMAxCD3 bsAb in an IgG-based format that induces fully target cell-restricted T cell activity against prostate cancer (1). Targeting PSMA, which is expressed on both the malignant cells and the neovasculature, improves accessibility of the tumor site for immune effector cells as critical prerequisite for therapeutic success in solid tumors. Methods: A FIH trial evaluating CC-1 included patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC) (NCT04104607) and consisted of two parts: Dose escalation (n=10-66) using a novel intra-individual dose escalation design to rapidly reach the target dose of 826µg to determine safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (2), and Dose expansion, which exposed patients to CC-1 at MTD and explored efficacy to define RP2D (n=14). Currently, subcutaneous (SC) application as different application mode is being evaluated. Based on very favorable safety and preliminary efficacy data, another phase I trial was initiated where CC-1 is evaluated as first line treatment in patients with hormone sensitive biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PC (NCT05646550), where tumor burden is low and accordingly lower side effects and long-lasting efficacy are expected. Results: Recruitment in the FIH trial in mCRPC has been completed. 28 patients completed treatment with the most frequently observed (86%) toxicity being cytokine release syndrome (CRS, max. 2°). Other adverse events (all ≤2°) included hematologic events (93%) as well as elevated liver enzymes (61%), hypertension (18%) and xerostomia (7%). A rapid and profound decline of PSA levels with up to 62% reduction compared to baseline was documented in all but one of the heavily pretreated patients that received the target dose. Twelve patients received multiple treatment cycles. Recruitment of patients to receive SC application of CC-1 is currently ongoing. In the phase I trial in BCR of PC, the first four dose cohorts have so far been completed. CC-1 application was well tolerated in all patients. In all but one of so far treated patients, mild CRS (transiently elevated temperature) that ceased within 24h upon dosing with antipyretics was observed. No other CC-1 related toxicities were observed and recruitment is ongoing. Conclusions: CC-1 is a promising compound with a favourable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity. Details on study designs and updated data from the clinical trials will be presented at the meeting. 1. Zekri et al, EMBO Mol Med, 2020. 2. Labrenz et al, Pharm Stat, 2022.

        <tr id="Blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) are both active in relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and improve outcomes compared with conventional chemotherapy in this setting. Several prospective clinical trials have explored the use of these agents in adults with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL, with promising outcomes observed in younger and older adults and in both Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative ALL. These novel regimens result in high rates of deep measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity and may improve survival compared with chemotherapy-only approaches, allowing for less reliance on intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This review discusses novel approaches to integrating INO and/or blinatumomab into frontline ALL regimens, including the potential role of chemotherapy-free regimens in some subgroups. The role of MRD monitoring is also discussed, including how this can inform decisions for consolidative allogeneic HSCT or investigational approaches with CD19 CAR T-cells.">

        <tr id="The treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has reached overall survival rates exceeding 90%. The present and future challenges are to cure the remainder of patients still dying from disease, and to reduce morbidity and mortality in those who can be cured with standard-of-care chemotherapy by replacing toxic chemotherapy elements while retaining cure rates. With the novel therapeutic options introduced in the last years, including immunotherapies and targeted antibodies, the treatment of ALL is undergoing major changes. For B-cell precursor ALL, blinatumomab, an anti-CD19 bispecific antibody, has established its role in the consolidation treatment for both high- and standard-risk first relapse of ALL, in the presence of bone marrow involvement, and may also have an impact on the outcome of high-risk subsets such as infant ALL and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 drug conjugated antibody, has demonstrated high efficacy in inducing complete remission in relapsed ALL, even in the presence of high tumor burden, but randomized phase III trials are still ongoing. For T-ALL the role of CD38-directed treatment, such as daratumumab, is gaining interest, but randomized data are needed to assess its specific benefit. These antibodies are currently being tested in patients with newly diagnosed ALL and may lead to major changes in the present paradigm of treatment of pediatric ALL. Unlike the past, lessons may be learned from innovations in adult ALL, in which more drastic changes are piloted that may need to be translated to pediatrics.">

        <tr id="The advent of targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies, adoptive T-cell therapies, and antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) dramatically changed the treatment landscape of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) over the last two decades. Rituximab was the first one approved. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells are currently approved as second-line treatment in patients with DLBCL refractory to first-line chemo-immunotherapy. Polatuzumab, a CD79b-targeting ADC, is approved as first-line treatment in high-risk patients in combination with chemo-immunotherapy. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are a novel category of drugs that are also changing the treatment paradigm of patients with DLBCL. They are engineered to bind to two different targets at the same time. To date, two BsAbs (glofitamab and epcoritamab) are approved as monotherapy in third-line treatment in DLBCL. Combination strategies with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ADCs are currently under investigation with encouraging results in first-line or subsequent lines of treatment. In the following review, we focus on the structure of BsAbs, the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, and the mechanisms of resistance to BsAbs.">

        <tr id="In the last decade, there has been a surge in developing immunotherapies to enhance the immune system's ability to eliminate tumor cells. Bispecific antibodies known as T cell engagers (TCEs) present an attractive strategy in this pursuit. TCEs aim to guide cytotoxic T cells toward tumor cells, thereby inducing a strong activation and subsequent tumor cell lysis. In this study, we investigated the activity of different TCEs on both conventional alpha-beta (αβ) T cells and unconventional gamma delta (γδ) T cells. TCEs were built using camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs) targeting the tumor-associated antigen CEACAM5 (CEA), together with T cell receptor chains or a CD3 domain. We show that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells display stronger in vitro antitumor activity than αβ T cells when stimulated with a CD3xCEA TCE. Furthermore, restricting the activation of fresh human peripheral T cells to Vγ9Vδ2 T cells limited the production of protumor factors and proinflammatory cytokines, commonly associated with toxicity in patients. Taken together, our findings provide further insights that γδ T cell-specific TCEs hold promise as specific, effective, and potentially safe molecules to improve antitumor immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="7546 Background: Elranatamab is a BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody with an accelerated approval in the US and EU for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Elranatamab binds to CD3 on T cells and BCMA on MM tumor cells; this dual binding results in T cell activation, cytokine release, and tumor cell killing. Engagement of the BCMA surface receptor by its ligands, APRIL and BAFF, mediates plasma cell proliferation and survival. Elevated BCMA, as well as BAFF and APRIL are present in MM patients, yet in vitro functional assays have shown physiologically relevant soluble APRIL or BAFF concentrations did not significantly impact elranatamab activity. Moreover, emerging clinical data from relapsed patients has identified novel, yet relatively rare BCMA protein mutations that may impact BCMA ligand or targeted modality binding. Here we characterized the BCMA binding affinity, evaluated the impact on BCMA binding to BAFF and APRIL interactions, and identified the BCMA binding epitope. We also generated a model from crystal structure data to map reported BCMA mutations identified in patients. Methods: Elranatamab binding affinity to recombinant human BCMA and characterization of BAFF and APRIL interactions with elranatamab-bound BCMA were calculated via SPR at 37˚C with a classical sandwich format. The elranatamab BCMA binding epitope was identified by a co-crystal structure with a parental anti-BCMA Fab that has identical CDR sequences to elranatamab. Alpha-fold modeling was used to map identified BCMA mutations on the antibody/BCMA interface. Results: Elranatamab binds to BCMA with higher affinity (~38 pM) compared to reported binding affinities of BAFF (μM range) and APRIL (nM range) ligands. The identified elranatamab epitope largely overlaps with known ligand epitopes, supporting that elranatamab higher affinity BCMA binding blocks ligand binding. Alpha fold modeling of four recently reported rare BCMA mutations shows that they lie along the binding interface. Conclusions: Due to its high affinity for BCMA, elranatamab potency is unlikely to be impacted by elevated levels of soluble BAFF or APRIL in RRMM patients. Future studies are needed to characterize the impact of emerging MM patient BCMA mutations on the binding and function of anti-BCMA targeting modalities, particularly given the small extracellular domain of BCMA available for therapeutic targeting and the highly overlapping binding epitopes reported for approved BCMA agents.">

        <tr id="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an orphan neurodegenerative disease. Immune system dysregulation plays an essential role in ALS onset and progression. Our preclinical studies have shown that the administration of exogenous allogeneic B cells improves outcomes in murine models of skin and brain injury through a process termed pligodraxis, in which B cells adopt an immunoregulatory and neuroprotective phenotype in an injured environment. Here, we investigated the effects of B-cell therapy in the SOD1G93A mouse preclinical model of ALS and in a person living with ALS. Purified splenic mature naïve B cells from haploidentical donor mice were administered intravenously in SOD1G93A mice for a total of 10 weekly doses. For the clinical study in a person with advanced ALS, IgA gammopathy of unclear significance, and B lymphopenia, CD19+ B cells were positively selected from a healthy haploidentical donor and infused intravenously twice, at a 60-day interval. Repeated intravenous B-cell administration was safe and significantly delayed disease onset, extended survival, reduced cellular apoptosis, and decreased astrogliosis in SOD1G93A mice. Repeated B-cell infusion in a person with ALS was safe and did not appear to generate a clinically evident inflammatory response. An improvement of 5 points on the ALSFRS-R scale was observed after the first infusion. Levels of inflammatory markers showed persistent reduction post-infusion. This represents a first demonstration of the efficacy of haploidentical B-cell infusion in the SOD1G93A mouse and the safety and feasibility of using purified haploidentical B lymphocytes as a cell-based therapeutic strategy for a person with ALS.">

In contrast to directly acting traditional antiviral drugs, such as ganciclovir, we aim to emulate a physiological infection control using T cells. For this, we constructed several bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) constructs targeting different viral glycoproteins of the murine cytomegalovirus and evaluated them in vitro for their efficacy. To isolate the target specific effect without viral immune evasion, we established stable reporter cell lines expressing the viral target glycoprotein B, and the glycoprotein complexes gN-gM and gH-gL, as well as nano-luciferase (nLuc). First, we evaluated binding capacities using flow cytometry and established killing assays, measuring nLuc-release upon cell lysis. All BiTE constructs proved to be functional mediators for T-cell recruitment and will allow a proof of concept for this treatment option. This might pave the way for strikingly safer immunosuppression in vulnerable patient groups.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a breakthrough cancer therapy over the past decade. Remarkable outcomes in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and multiple myeloma have been reported in both pivotal trials and real-word studies. Traditionally, the use of a patient’s own (autologous) T cells to manufacture CAR products has been the standard practice. Nevertheless, this approach has some drawbacks, including manufacturing delays, dependence on the functional fitness of the patient’s T cells, which can be compromised by both the disease and prior therapies, and contamination of the product with blasts. A promising alternative is offered by the development of allogeneic CAR-cell products. This approach has the potential to yield more efficient drug products and enables the use of effector cells with negligible alloreactive potential and a significant CAR-independent antitumor activity through their innate receptors (i.e., natural killer cells, γδ T cells and cytokine induced killer cells). In addition, recent advances in genome editing tools offer the potential to overcome the primary challenges associated with allogeneic CAR T-cell products, namely graft-versus-host disease and host allo-rejection, generating universal, off-the-shelf products. In this review, we summarize the current pre-clinical and clinical approaches based on allogeneic CAR T cells, as well as on alternative effector cells, which represent exciting opportunities for multivalent approaches and optimized antitumor activity.">

        <tr id="e19008 Background: Bispecific antibodies (BsAb) have emerged as a new treatment modality for relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas (R/R NHL). They exert their effect by binding to CD3 on T-cells and CD19 or CD20 on lymphoma cells, activating the T-cell to exert cytotoxic effects against the tumor and normal B-cells. Treatment related adverse events (TRAE) include infections, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS). This meta-analysis was conducted to assess prevalence of TRAEs from prospective clinical trials that evaluated BsAb in R/R NHL. Methods: A systematic review was conducted through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane to identify BsAb clinical trials in NHL through October 2023. Eligible studies included phase I-III trials evaluating BsAb in any type of NHL, either as monotherapy or combination therapy irrespective of prior lines of treatment. Primary outcomes of interest include infection, neutropenia, CRS, and ICANS. All studies were weighted equally. Pooled prevalence estimates of TRAE were calculated using common and random effects models. Heterogeneity tests were performed using Cochran’s Q test. Subgroup analysis examined infection rates in monotherapy versus combination therapy cohorts. Results: After screening 1039 studies, 36 clinical trials with 2162 patients were included. The lymphoma subtypes were diffuse-large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. The BsAbs included mosunetuzumab (13 studies), epcoritamab (10 studies), blinatumomab (5 studies), glofitamab (5 studies), odronextamab (2 studies), and AFM11 (1 study). The median age of patients was 66 years, and patients had received a median of two prior lines of therapy. Median follow-up duration was 9.1 months. The prevalence of all-grade infections was 35% (95% CI: 0.33-0.38; I2 = 79%). For grade ≥3 infections, the prevalence was 16% (95% CI: 0.14-0.18, (I2 = 77%). There were higher rates of all-grade infections in the combination therapy cohort (41%, 95% CI: 0.36-0.47) compared with the monotherapy cohort (33%, 95% CI: 0.30-0.36). All-grade and grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 31% (95% CI: 0.29-0.34; I2 = 80%) and 22% (95% CI: 0.20-0.24, I2 = 61%) of patients. CRS was observed in 45% of patients (95% CI: 0.43-0.48, I2 = 85%). Grade ≥3 CRS occurred in only 2% of patients (95% CI: 0.02-0.03, I2 = 0%, p = 0.99). ICANS occurred in 12% (95% CI: 0.10-0.14, I2 = 90%) while grade ≥3 ICANS was rare, at 3% (95% CI: 0.02-0.03, I2 = 0%, p = 0.99). Conclusions: BsAb is associated with nontrivial rates of infections and neutropenia. The rates of high grade CRS and ICANS are low. The heterogeneity of the findings could be attributed by an underreporting of TRAE and small sample sizes from various studies. These results highlight the need for vigilant practices to diagnose and treat infections early and consideration for antibacterial prophylaxis in this immunocompromised population.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) provide a new mode of targeting multiple myeloma (MM) plasma cells (PCs), basing their action on the activation and redirection of the T-cell compartment against neoplastic cells. Two BCMA-targeting (teclistamab and elranatamab) plus one GPRC5D-targeting (talquetamab) BsAbs are available for the management of heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) MM. Novel strategies to augment potency, reduce toxicity, and improve management are under investigation. This review summarizes the clinical applications of BsAbs and discusses the current challenges of the treatment and opportunities for optimization. Abstract Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are artificially engineered antibodies that can bind simultaneously to the CD3 subunit within the T-cell receptor complex and an antigen on tumor cells, leading to T-cell activation and tumor cell killing. BsAbs against BCMA or GPRC5D have shown impressive clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), with some agents having already received regulatory approval after the third (by the European Medicines Agency, EMA) or fourth (by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA) line of therapy; the results of early-phase clinical trials targeting FcRH5 are also promising. Overall, BsAbs as monotherapy correlated with an ORR that exceeded 60%, with a high CR rate ranging between 25% and 50% and a median PFS of around 1 year among patients with a median of 4–6 prior lines of therapy. The main toxicities include cytokine release syndrome, cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections; on-target off-tumor adverse events involving the skin, mucosa, hair, and nails may also occur with anti-GPRC5D BsAbs. Active research to increase their efficacy and improve their tolerance is still in progress, including combination therapies and application in earlier treatment lines and the development of novel agents. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance is a challenge and could lead to more personalized approaches.">

        <tr id=": Recently, bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are evolving the landscape of cancer treatment and have significantly improved the outcomes of relapsed or refractory cancer patients. As increasing BsAbs entered clinical practice, specific toxicities have emerged, and renal side-effects have been described. However, there are a lack of studies analyzing the nephrotoxicity in the anti-cancer BsAbs recipients systematically. In this review, we demonstrate the etiologies, mechanisms, other risk factors and treatment options of kidney injury in the BsAbs recipients to provide a more comprehensive insight into the nephrotoxicity post-BsAbs therapy. Significantly, due to the limited clinical trial data on each subject, we mainly conclude the related etiologies, mechanisms, and risk factors of nephrotoxicity that occur in T-cell-engaging BsAbs recipients. Nephrotoxicity associated with non-T-cell BsAbs may be associated with adverse nephrotoxicity of related monoclonal antibodies to two specific antigens. The aim of this paper is to provide nephrologists and oncologists with theoretical knowledge to provide better medical management for recipients who receive BsAbs, especially T-cell-engaging BsAbs treatment.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Interleukin-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6R Abs), including satralizumab, are increasingly used to prevent relapse for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, the detailed mechanism of action of this treatment on the lymphocyte phenotype remains unclear. This study focused on B cells in patients with NMOSD, hypothesizing that IL-6R Ab enables B cells to acquire regulatory functions by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro to induce the expansion of B-cell subsets, double-negative B cells (DNs; CD19+ IgD−, CD27−) and plasmablasts (PBs; CD19+, CD27hi, CD38hi). Whole B cells, DNs, or PBs were isolated after culture with IL-6R Ab, and IL-10 expression was quantified using quantitative PCR and a cytometric bead array. RNA sequencing was performed to identify the marker of regulatory PBs induced by IL-6R Ab. Results DNs and PBs were observed to expand in patients with NMSOD during the acute attacks. In the in vitro model, IL-6R Ab increased IL-10 expression in B cells. Notably, IL-10 expression increased in PBs but not in DNs. Using RNA sequencing, CD200 was identified as a marker of regulatory PBs among the differentially expressed upregulated genes. CD200+ PBs produced more IL-10 than CD200− PBs. Furthermore, patients with NMOSD who received satralizumab had a higher proportion of CD200+ PBs than patients during the acute attacks. Discussion Treatment with IL-6 signaling blockade elicited a regulatory phenotype in B cells and PBs. CD200+ PBs may be a marker of treatment responsiveness in the context of NMOSD pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="7066 Background: Despite advanced treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T), a significant proportion of patients succumb to relapsed and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). In vitro experiments suggest synergism between BTK inhibitor (BTKi) and T-cell engager, we initiated a multicenter trial of poseltinib and glofitamab in combination with lenalidomide in R/R DLBCL. Methods: This is a phase II, open label, single arm study aiming to enroll 76 participants with adult R/R DLBCL patients (NCT05335018). Patients refractory to frontline therapy or those who failed more than two lines of therapies were enrolled. Previous anti-CD19 CAR-T was allowed, while previous CD20 T-cell engager was not permitted. Participants received glofitamab (In cycle 1, dose is increased weekly from 2.5mg to 10mg, and after cycle 2, 30mg is administered on Day 1), lenalidomide (20mg daily from Day 1-14), and poseltinib (40mg twice daily from Day 1-21) (GPL) every 3 weeks for a total of 12 cycles(induction). Maintenance with poseltinib and lenalidomide for 17 cycles were given to patients after induction period. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR), with secondary endpoints including duration of response (DoR), complete response rate (CRR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of treatment related adverse events. Results: No safety signals were observed in the safety cohort (n=6, 3+3 design). As of November 2023, 37 patients (median age 71) have been treated with GPL, with a median follow up duration of 3.6 months. In prior lines of therapy, 13 patients (35.1%) received treatment more than 2, and 26 patients (70.3%) were with Ann Arbor stage III/IV and 7 patients (18.9%) were refractory to frontline treatment. Previously, 3 patients (8.1%) received CAR-T. Out of 28 evaluable patients, ORR was 89.3%, with CRR of 42.9%. Six-month OS and PFS rate were 81% and 55%. DoR at 6 months was 66%. Neutropenia (45.9%) was the most common grade(gr) 3-4. Three patients (8.1%) died of gr5. There was 1 case (2.7%) of gr3 atrial fibrillation and gr1 bleeding. No incidence of gr3 or above liver/renal toxicity were observed. Overall, 3 patients (8.1%) discontinued GPL treatment due to toxicity, and cytokine release syndrome was observed in 7 patients (18.9%) and only 2 patients (5.4%) were gr3-4. Conclusions: Interim analysis indicates that the GPL regimen is an effective and safe regimen for R/R DLBCL patients. High response rates observed support further investigation of GPL for potential synergism between T-cell engagers and BTKi. This multicenter study is actively recruiting patients and is set to complete enrollment within this year. Clinical trial information: NCT05335018 . [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment for various hematological malignancies. Still, its remarkable efficacy is accompanied by unique adverse events that must be carefully managed. This comprehensive literature review evaluates the safety profile of CAR T-cell therapy, focusing on cytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and other potential complications. Cytopenia, characterized by reduced blood cell counts, affects a significant proportion of patients, with rates of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia reaching up to 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. Risk factors include high tumor burden, prior chemotherapy, and bone marrow involvement. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs in 13% to 77% of patients and is linked to the cytokine storm induced by CAR T cells, target antigen expression, and preexisting immune dysregulation. Other notable adverse events discussed are cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and infections. Understanding the mechanisms, risk factors, and management strategies for these adverse events is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and unlocking the full potential of this revolutionary therapy. The review highlights the need for continued research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evidence-based approaches to enhance the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="7567 Background: BCMA targeting bispecific Antibody (bsAb) therapy has shown unprecedented response and survival rates in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The clinical activity of bsAb therapy has been shown to depend on T-cell function, yet clinical parameters, such as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) have not been found to be associated with response to bsAbs. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether distinct T cell subsets, such as CD4 and CD8 counts as well as their proportion within the ALC are associated with outcome of BCMA targeting bsAb therapy. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on 79 patients who had been treated with at least one full dose of a BCMA targeting bsAb. T cell subsets, including ALC, total CD3, CD4 and CD8, were measured from peripheral blood within 7 days prior to bsAb therapy initiation. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4 using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Median age of the patient cohort was 72 (31-84) years with 40/79 (51%) being male and 15/79 (19%) being African American. Median lines of therapy was 5 (2-12) with 78/79 (99%) patients being triple class refractory and 50/79 (63%) being penta-drug refractory. 59/79 (75%) of patients had at least one prior stem cell transplant (SCT) with 35/79 (44%) having had at least two SCTs. 26/79 (33%) patients had prior exposure to BCMA targeting therapy, with 18/79 (23%) and 8/79 (10%) previously having received belantamab mafodotin or BCMA targeting Car-T cell therapy respectively. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 38/79 (48%) of patients with the majority (92%) being grade 1 with the remainder being grade 2. Median ALC was 1.02 (0.25-5) x103/mL, median CD4 count was 0.27 (0.04-1.13) x103/mL while median CD8 count was 0.5 (0.07-2.97) x103/mL. Overall response (OR) rate of the whole cohort was 82% (69/79) with best responders (³very good partial response) comprising 51% (40/79). While total ALC, CD4 and CD8 counts did not appear to impact response to BCMA targeting bsAb therapy, the ratio of CD4 to ALC proved to be significantly associated with OR (univariate p=0.04) and best response (univariate p= 0.004, multivariate p=0.01) . The CD8 to ALC ratio had no significant impact in this patient population. The only other factor to show a significant association with response was the number of prior lines of therapy with higher numbers being associated with worse response (p=0.046). Conclusions: Our study suggests that an increased proportion of CD4 cells within the ALC is significantly associated with better response to BCMA targeting bsAb. While future studies are needed to elaborate on CD4 function in bsAB therapy, our findings imply that therapeutic strategies to increase the CD4 proportion could lead to improved bsAb therapy effectiveness.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells and Bispecific Antibodies (BsAb) are the leading platforms for redirecting the immune system against cells expressing the specific antigen, revolutionizing the treatment of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). In MM, drug-resistant relapses are the main therapy-limiting factor and the leading cause of why the disease is still considered incurable. T-cell-engaging therapies hold promise in improving the treatment of MM. However, the effectiveness of these treatments may be hindered by T-cell fitness. T-cell exhaustion is a condition of a gradual decline in effector function, reduced cytokine secretion, and increased expression of inhibitory receptors due to chronic antigen stimulation. Areas covered This review examines findings about T-cell exhaustion in MM in the context of T-cell redirecting BsAbs and CAR-T treatment. Expert opinion The fitness of T-cells has become an important factor in the development of T-cell redirecting therapies. The way T-cell exhaustion relates to these therapies could affect the further development of CAR and BsAbs technologies, as well as the strategies used for clinical use. Therefore, this review aims to explore the current understanding of T-cell exhaustion in MM and its relationship to these therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T-cell engaging (TCE) bispecific antibodies are potent drugs that trigger the immune system to eliminate cancer cells, but administration can be accompanied by toxic side effects that limit dosing. TCEs function by binding to cell surface receptors on T cells, frequently CD3, with one arm of the bispecific antibody while the other arm binds to cell surface antigens on cancer cells. On-target, off-tumor toxicity can arise when the target antigen is also present on healthy cells. The toxicity of TCEs may be ameliorated through the use of pro-drug forms of the TCE, which are not fully functional until recruited to the tumor microenvironment. This can be accomplished by masking the anti-CD3 arm of the TCE with an autoinhibitory motif that is released by tumor-enriched proteases. Here, we solve the crystal structure of the antigen-binding fragment of a novel anti-CD3 antibody, E10, in complex with its epitope from CD3 and use this information to engineer a masked form of the antibody that can activate by the tumor-enriched protease matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). We demonstrate with binding experiments and in vitro T-cell activation and killing assays that our designed prodrug TCE is capable of tumor-selective T-cell activity that is dependent upon MMP-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a similar masking strategy can be used to create a pro-drug form of the frequently used anti-CD3 antibody SP34. This study showcases an approach to developing immune-modulating therapeutics that prioritizes safety and has the potential to advance cancer immunotherapy treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a prevalent kidney cancer for which long-term survival rates are abysmal, though immunotherapies are showing potential. Not yet clinically vetted are bispecific T cell engagers (BTEs) that activate T cell-mediated cancer killing through intercellular synapsing. Multiple BTE formats exist, however, with limited cross-characterizations to help optimize new drug design. Here, we developed BTEs to treat ccRCC by targeting carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) while characterizing the persistent BTE (PBTE) format and comparing it to a new format, the persistent multivalent T cell engager (PMTE). These antibody therapies against ccRCC are developed as both recombinant and synthetic DNA (synDNA) medicines. Methods Antibody formatting effects on binding kinetics were assessed by flow cytometry and intercellular synaptic strength assays while potency was tested using T-cell activation and cytotoxicity assays. Mouse models were used to study antibody plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics, as well as antitumor efficacy as both recombinant and synDNA medicines. Specifically, three models using ccRCC cell line xenografts and human donor T cells in immunodeficient mice were used to support this study. Results Compared with a first-generation BTE, we show that the PBTE reduced avidity, intercellular synaptic strength, cytotoxic potency by as much as 33-fold, and ultimately efficacy against ccRCC tumors in vivo. However, compared with the PBTE, we demonstrate that the PMTE improved cell avidity, restored intercellular synapses, augmented cytotoxic potency by 40-fold, improved tumor distribution pharmacokinetics by 2-fold, and recovered synDNA efficacy in mouse tumor models by 20-fold. All the while, the PMTE displayed a desirable half-life of 4 days in mice compared with the conventional BTE’s 2 hours. Conclusions With impressive efficacy, the CA9-targeted PMTE is a promising new therapy for advanced ccRCC, which can be effectively delivered through synDNA. The highly potent PMTE format itself is a promising new tool for future applications in the multispecific antibody space.">

        <tr id="Leveraging endogenous tumor-resident T-cells for immunotherapy using bispecific antibodies (BsAb) targeting CD20 and CD3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, features associated with treatment response or resistance are unknown. To this end, we analyzed data from patients treated with epcoritamab-containing regimens in the EPCORE NHL-2 trial (NCT04663347). We observed downregulation of CD20 expression on B-cells following treatment initiation both in progressing patients and in patients achieving durable complete responses (CR), suggesting that CD20 downregulation does not universally predict resistance to BsAb-based therapy. Single-cell immune profiling of tumor biopsies obtained following one cycle of therapy revealed substantial clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in patients achieving CR, and an expansion of follicular helper and regulatory CD4+ T-cells in patients whose disease progressed. These results identify distinct tumor-resident T-cell profiles associated with response or resistance to BsAb therapy.">

CD33 CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory (r/r) AML have reported limited or no significant anti-leukemic effects (Tambaro FP, et al. Leukemia. 2021 Nov;35(11):3282-3286; Wang QS, et al. Mol Ther. 2015 Jan;23(1):184-91). CD123 CAR T-cell therapy has weak proliferation and low CR rates (Wermke M, et al. Blood. 2021 Jun 3;137(22):3145-3148; Cummins, Katherine D. et al. Blood. 2017; 130: 1359), while CLL1 CAR T-cell therapy has induced anti-leukemic responses in a small subset of patients without sustained expansion (Pei K, et al. Cancer Med. 2023 Apr;12(8):9655-9661; Jin X, et al. J Hematol Oncol. 2022 Jul 7;15(1):88). Here, we present early safety and efficacy of functionally enhanced CD33 CAR T cells in AML. Methods: We improved the performance of CD33 CAR T cells by adding a potentiating molecule linked to human CD33 scFv by P2A. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04835519). The trial used the “3+3” approach, starting with an initial dose of 5×105 (±20%)/kg. The primary endpoint was safety with efficacy secondary. Results: Four relapsed patients, including three who underwent stem cell transplantation, were enrolled and received initial dose of CAR T cells between April 13, and July 28, 2021. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee approved the preliminary report. Three patients (75%) experienced grade 1−2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while one (25%) had grade 4 CRS. One developed grade 2 CRS after the second infusion. One patient had dose-limiting toxicity. Two patients (50%) had grade 1 neurotoxicity, and two (50%) developed grade 1–2 graft-versus-host disease. All patients experienced grade 2–4 neutropenia, monocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. One patient developed sepsis. Two patients achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and were MRD-negative at day 30, while two had no response. Of these, one patient received a second infusion and achieved MRD+ CRi. Two patients have remained disease free for over two years. One patient remained disease free for one year before CD33+ relapse. The two patients with CRi had peak CAR T cell counts of 192 and 23.5 cells/μl, while the two without CRi had lower peak counts of 2.12 and 10.3 cells/μl. One patient peaked at 1.73 cells/μl after the second infusion. The two patients with CRi also had a higher proportion of CAR T cells among the lymphocytes (46.8% and 53.0%). As expected, peripheral blood CD33+ cells decreased. Conclusions: We report the safety and efficacy of functionally enhanced CD33 CAR T cells. While some patients had CRi, there was also depletion of CD33-positive normal cells. Thus, further research is needed to address the issue of normal cell depletion.

        <tr id="HBI0101 is an academic chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) targeted to BCMA for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and light chain amyloidosis. Herein, we present the Phase Ib/II results of fifty heavily pre-treated RRMM patients dosed with 800x106 CART cells (NCT04720313). Inclusion criteria were relatively permissive (i.e., performance status and baseline organ function) and consequently, about half of the enrolled patients would have been ineligible for pivotal clinical trials. The median time elapsed from patient enrolment until CART delivery was 25 days (range, 14-65). HBI0101-related toxicities included grade 1-3 cytokine-release syndrome, grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities and grade 1-2 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Responses were achieved in 90% of the patients, 56% achieved stringent and complete response (sCR/CR), and 70% reached a minimal residual disease negativity. Within a median follow-up of 12.3 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.0 months; (95% CI, 6.2-14.6), and the overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 13.3-not reached). Multivariable analysis on patient/disease and CART cell-related characteristics revealed that high-risk cytogenetic, extramedullary disease, and increased number of effector-memory T-cells in CART products were independently associated with inferior PFS. In conclusion, comprehensive analyses of the parameters affecting the response to CART therapy are essential for improving patients' outcome.">

Evidence of immune evasion during AML progression, such as HLA loss and T-cell exhaustion, suggests that antileukemic immune responses contribute to disease control and could be harnessed by immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss a spectrum of AML immunotherapy targets, encompassing cancer cell-intrinsic and surface antigens as well as targeting in the leukemic milieu, and how they can be tailored for personalized approaches. These targets are overviewed across major immunotherapy modalities applied to AML: immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, therapeutic vaccines, bispecific/trispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and CAR-NK cells. Significance: Immune therapies in AML treatment show evolving promise. Ongoing research aims to customize approaches for varied patient profiles and clinical scenarios. This review covers immune surveillance mechanisms, therapy options like checkpoint inhibitors, antibodies, CAR-T/NK cells, and vaccines, as well as resistance mechanisms and microenvironment considerations.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for eradicating human cancers. Their therapeutic success and durability of clinical responses hinges, in large part, on their functional capacity, including the ability of these engineered cells to simultaneously expand and persist after infusion into patients. CD19 CAR T-cell polyfunctionality, assessing the simultaneous functions of cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxicity has been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes. Assay optimization is potentially limited by the heterogeneous nature of CAR T-cell infusion products and target specificity. We optimized a single-cell platform for polyfunctionality using CAR T cell products manufactured from healthy donors, engineered against a novel target, BAFF-R, and validated the protocol using CD19 CAR T cells. We observed distinct qualitative differences between BAFF-R and CD19 CAR T cells relative to the proportions of stimulatory vs. effector cytokines, based on target antigen density, and generally, CD19 CAR T cells exhibited lower indices of polyfunctionality. Finally, we applied our assay to the autologous BAFF-R CAR T-cell product generated from the first NHL patient treated on an ongoing clinical trial who had progressed after prior CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. We observed robust indicators of polyfunctionality, which correlated with successful CAR T cell expansion after infusion and achievement of durable complete remission ongoing after 18 months. The precise identification of factors determining the role of BAFF-R CAR T-cell fitness on toxicity and clinical outcome will require the application of this robust assay in the analysis of additional treated patients.">

        <tr id="7058 Background: Follicular and marginal zone B cell lymphoma (FL; MZL) demonstrate an indolent course with heterogeneous outcomes anda potential for spontaneous remissions indicating immune system intervention. Therapeutic immunization is therefore an attractive approach but new antigens that evoke a strong immune response are needed. EO2463 expands pre-existing memory CD8+ T cells recognizing non-self protein sequences from gut bacteria which cross-react with B cell antigens and can kill HLA-A2 restricted cells (T2) loaded with target peptides. EO2463 includes 4 HLA-A2 synthetically produced epitopes which exhibit molecular mimicry with the B cell markers CD20, CD22, CD37, and CD268 (BAFF-receptor), as well as a the CD4 helper-epitope UCP2 derived from hTERT. EO2463 is being used to drive anti-tumor activity against B cell malignancies. Methods: Patients (pts) with FL and MZL, stage 1-3A, and HLA-A2, are eligible. In the safety lead-in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease were given EO2463 SC q2 weeks (w) x 4, then q4w, for a max of 12 months; at w7 lenalidomide (20 mg/day for 21/28 days up to 12 cycles) is added (EL), and if no complete remission (CR) at w19, rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV, q1w x 4, then q4w x 4) is also added (ER2). Doses evaluated: 150 μg and 300μg/peptide. Results: 3 pts received 150 μg/peptide and 6 pts 300 μg/peptide (EO2463 1 pat, EL 2 pts, ER2 6 pts): 2 MZL, 7 FL pts with median 2 lines (range 1-4) of prior systemic therapy. No related grade ≥3 adverse events were seen with EO2463 monotherapy. Most common related events were grade 1 to 2 local administration site reactions in 5/9 pts. Adverse events during combination treatment were as expected for R2. PET-CT on w6 after EO2463 monotherapy suggested clinical activity in 4/9 pts (1 PR, 1 pt size reduction 15%, 1 pt 20% reduced tracer uptake, 1 pt 5/6 target lesions reduced metabolic activity). Overall objective responses (OR) were seen in 6/9 pts (67%; 1st OR on EO2463 1 pat, EL 4 pts, ER2 1 pat), with CR in 5/9 (56%) pts; median time to response was 18w (range 8-43w), response ongoing in 5 pts, range 24-76w. Expansion of specific CD8+ T cells against mimic peptides and targeted B cell antigens were detected in all responding pts, incl. 2 pts with no measurable B cells at baseline (prior anti-CD20). Expansion of specific T cells was detected at w5 in 5/6 pts and was maintained as long as currently tested (up to w94, 43w after last EO2463 dose). No decline in expansions were seen after start rituximab. Conclusions: EO2463 (300 μg/peptide) monotherapy, EL, and ER2 are well tolerated, with encouraging clinical activity with EO2463 monotherapy and with subsequent CR in 5/9 pts on combo. Rapid and durable expansion of specific CD8+ T cells was seen in all responding pts, consistent with the preclinical hypothesis. Additional cohorts investigate EO2463 alone or in combination in newly diagnosed or R/R pts. Results will be reported at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT04669171 .">

Owing to the rapidly progressing field of CAR-T cell therapy and the lack of generally accepted treatment guidelines, we hypothesized significant differences between European centers in prevention, diagnosis and management of short- and long-term complications. To capture the current CAR-T cell management among EBMT centers and to determine the medical need and specific areas for future clinical research the EBMT Transplant Complications Working Party performed a survey among 227 EBMT CAR-T cell centers. We received complete servey answers from 106 centers (47%) addressing questions in the areas of product selection, CAR-T cell logistics, management of cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome as well as management in later phases including prolonged cytopenias. We identified common patterns in complication management, but also significant variety in clinical management of the centers in important aspects. Our results demonstrate a high medical need for treatment harmonization and future clinical research in the following areas: treatment of steroid-refractory and very severe CRS/neurotoxicity, treatment of cytopenia, early discharge and outpatient management, as well as immunoglobulin substitution.">

Several clinical trials over the past decade have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of certain Treg cell‐based therapies against autoimmune diseases, inspiring optimism among patients. Studies have indicated that targeted cell pharmaceuticals are significantly promising, offering superior targeting, improved biocompatibility, and prolonged blood circulation. Thus, Treg cell‐based delivery systems are also extensively studied.

        <tr id="Although preclinical investigations have shown notable efficacy in solid tumor models utilizing in vitro-differentiated Th17 cells for adoptive cell therapy (ACT), the potential benefits of this strategy in enhancing ACT efficacy in hematological malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), remain unexplored. CLL is a B-cell malignancy with a clinical challenge of increased resistance to targeted therapies. T-cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have demonstrated limited success in CLL, which is attributed to CLL-mediated T-cell dysfunction and skewing toward immunosuppressive phenotypes. Herein, we illustrate the feasibility of polarizing CD4+ T cells from the Eμ-TCL1 murine model, the most representative model for human CLL, into Th17 phenotype, employing a protocol of T-cell activation through the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) alongside a polarizing cytokine mixture. We demonstrate augmented memory properties of in vitro-polarized IL-17-producing T cells, and preliminary in vivo persistence in leukemia-bearing mice. Our findings gain translational relevance through successful viral transduction of Eμ-TCL1 CD4+ T cells with a CD19-targeted CAR construct during in vitro Th17 polarization. Th17 CAR T cells exhibited remarkable persistence upon encountering antigen-expressing target cells. This study represents the first demonstration of the potential of in vitro-differentiated Th17 cells to enhance ACT efficacy in CLL.">

        <tr id="e14589 Background: MAGEA1, identified as a cancer/testis antigen, is highly expression in various solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, but absent in normal tissues except male germ cells and placenta, both of which lacking HLA class molecules. This selective expression of HLA-MAGEA1 epitope makes it a promising target for cancer therapy. However, its intracellular localization poses a challenge for conventional antibodies designed to target surface-expressed antigens. TCR-based T-cell engagers, such as Tebentafusp, overcome this hurdle by targeting intracellular protein-derived peptides presented on cancer cell surfaces via HLA, enabling precise cytotoxic T cell attacks. Notably, Tebentafusp has shown significant clinical benefits by improving survival rates in metastatic uveal melanoma, underscoring the efficacy of TCR-based T-cell engagers in treating MAGEA1-positive tumors. Methods: We have developed an advanced structural format, CR62, consisting of a anti-CD3 single chain fragment, a soluble modified TCR, and an Fc region. Additionally, the use of CorreGene's SMART-TCR system has facilitated the acquisition of TCRs with high affinities in the pico-molar range. By leveraging CR62 and a high-affinity TCR, we have conceptualized the TCR-based T-cell engager, CRPA1A2. Comprehensive preclinical assessments have been conducted to evaluate CRPA1A2's safety and efficacy. Results: CRPA1A2 is designed to specifically target the HLA-A*02:01-restricted MAGEA1 epitope, effectively inhibiting tumor growth. CRPA1A2 is characterized by its exceptional soluble expression in CHO cells, minimal homodimer miss-assembly and simplifying purification. It is strategically engineered with a high-affinity TCR and a low-affinity anti-CD3 scFv to optimize the efficacy and safety. In vitro studies, CRPA1A2 showed strong ability to eliminate tumor cells and induce IFN-γ release, effective even at low MAGEA1 epitope densities, with a therapeutic window that spans over three orders of magnitude, suggesting a 1000-fold greater activity against antigen-positive cancer cells compared to antigen-negative cells. In vivo, using a tumor-bearing mouse model, CRPA1A2 has been shown to recruit T cells into subcutaneous solid tumors, expand CD8+ T cell populations, and significantly reduce tumor mass. Notably, CRPA1A2 has an extended half-life of 120 hours and demonstrates preferential accumulation in tumor tissues, thereby enhancing its therapeutic potential. Moreover, the safety assessments for CRPA1A2 highlight its exceptional specificity, with in vitro studies showing no evidence of off-target toxicity, on-target off-tumor toxicity, or alloreactivity and favorable tolerance in mice during in vivo studies. Conclusions: CRPA1A2 has emerged as a superior TCR-based T-cell engager with exceptional antitumor efficacy and promising safety profile.">

FS222 is a novel affinity optimized, tetravalent bispecific PD-L1/CD137 antibody. FS222’s structure allows for potent, PD-L1-dependent, CD137 activation across a wide range of dose levels, and is designed to provide selective CD137 agonism in the tumor. We present data from the ongoing, FIH, open-label, phase I trial of FS222 in advanced solid tumors. Methods: Pts with pretreated advanced solid tumors received increasing doses of FS222 in an accelerated dose titration and 3+3 design intravenously every 3 or 4 weeks (Q4W) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was safety. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included pharmacokinetics, PD and antitumor activity (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1). Results: As of data cut off (DCO) on 05Dec2023, a total of 104 pts had been treated across a range of doses and schedules in the FIH study (NCT04740424). We report interim results from the Q4W cohorts (N=90). Patients had a median age of 61 years (31-88 years) and had received a median of 2 (1-7) regimens of prior treatments. The median duration of exposure to FS222 was 82.5 days (24 – 529 days). The most common treatment-related AEs (TRAEs; >20% of pts) were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, and neutropenia. The most common TRAEs grade ≥3 (≥10% of pts) were increased AST (13.3%) and ALT (11.1%). The most common treatment related serious AEs (≥3 pts) were febrile neutropenia (5 pts, 5.6%); and pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, increased ALT, increased AST (all in 3 pts, 3.3%). On-target FS222 pharmacology was confirmed by the presence of dose-dependent target engagement, significant peripheral CD8+ T cell modulation and increased tumor CD3+ CD8+ T cells at multiple dose levels. At the DCO, 20 (22.2%) pts remained on treatment. Objective responses (CR, PR) were observed in pts with melanoma, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, TNBC, liposarcoma and colon cancer, for an ORR of 15.7% with evidence of further enrichment by dose. In post-PD-1 treated metastatic/advanced cutaneous melanoma the ORR was 60% (9/15, all PRs - 7 confirmed) and the disease control rate was 86.7% (13/15). Conclusions: The novel PD-L1/CD137 bispecific antibody FS222 demonstrated PD activity across a broad range of doses. The safety profile was acceptable and manageable. Encouraging anti-tumor activity was observed, including in patients with PD-1 refractory cutaneous melanoma. Next steps include further dose optimization and further evaluation of FS222 in patients with melanoma and other tumor types. Clinical trial information: NCT04740424 .">

        <tr id="TPS7100 Background: Despite the promising efficacy of CAR-T for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphomas (LBCL), more than 60% of patients will relapse, the majority of which occur in the first 6 months. Approximately 30% of patients with LBCL treated with CAR-T achieve a partial response (PR) on day 30 (D30) PET-CT assessment. Of patients in a D30 PR, 70% will eventually progress, yet the standard of care remains close observation. Early consolidative treatment strategies utilizing therapies with a different mechanism of action may improve outcomes, but there are currently no reliable biomarkers. Epcoritamab (Epco), a bispecific antibody directed against CD20 and CD3, has been approved by the FDA for LBCL patients who relapse after at least 2 lines of therapy. In the phase 2 study, Epco was associated with an overall response rate (ORR) of 63% and a complete response (CR) rate of 39%, including similar responses in a subset of patients who were relapsed 100 days post CAR-T. This study is a trial-in-progress that will evaluate the efficacy of epco compared to observation for patients with LBCLs achieving a PR on D30 post CAR-T PET-CT assessment. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated, randomized, phase II, multicenter, open-label study (NCT06238648) evaluating epco monotherapy for a fixed duration of 12 cycles compared to observation for LBCL patients with D30 PR after standard of care CAR-T. A maximum of 120 patients will be randomized 1:1 to epco or observation across 10 academic centers. Stratification factors include line of CAR-T (second vs third line) and costimulatory domain (CD28 vs 4-1BB). Key inclusion criteria include PET evidence of a D30 PR. non-bulky disease ( <7.5cm), ANC of >1000, hemoglobin >7 g/dL if asymptomatic or >8 if symptomatic, platelet count >50,000. G-CSF, pRBCs and platelet transfusions are allowed. Key exclusion criteria include prior anti CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody therapy, ongoing or uncontrolled CRS or ICANS, and active or symptomatic CNS disease. Epco is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.16mg on day 1, 0.8mg on day 8, prior to full dose of 48mg on day 15. Epco is administered weekly in 28 day cycles (C) for C1-3, on day 1 and 15 of C4-9 and on day 1 of C10-12. PET-CT response is assessed by the 2014 Lugano criteria after 2 cycles, and then every 3 months during active treatment. The primary objective is efficacy, measured as conversion from D30 PR to CR. The secondary endpoints include frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events, ORR, duration of response, duration of complete response, progression free survival, event free survival, and overall survival. Peripheral blood samples will be collected pre-treatment and during treatment to assess for biomarkers of response and resistance. The study was activated in January 2024 and recruitment is ongoing.

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by a systemic dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems, leading to an attack on healthy tissues of the body. During the development of SLE, pathogenic features, such as the formation of autoantibodies to self-nuclear antigens, caused tissue damage including necrosis and fibrosis, with an increased expression of type Ⅰ interferon (IFN) regulated genes. Treatment of lupus with immunosuppressants and glucocorticoids, which are used as the standard therapy, is not effective enough and causes side effects. As an alternative, more effective immunotherapies have been developed, including monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that target B cells, T cells, co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines or their receptors, and signaling molecules. Encouraging results have been observed in clinical trials with some of these therapies. Furthermore, a chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as the most effective, safe, and promising treatment option for SLE, as demonstrated by successful pilot studies. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play a significant role in the severity of SLE, and the use of methods to normalize the gut microbiota, particularly fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), opens up new opportunities for effective treatment of SLE.">

        <tr id="Objectives The tuning effects of JAK/TYK2 inhibitors on the imbalance between T follicular helper (Tfh) and T regulatory (Treg) cells, related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis, were investigated using human peripheral blood samples. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from untreated patients with SLE and healthy controls were analysed. Tfh1 cells were identified in nephritis tissue, and the effect of Tfh1 cells on B-cell differentiation was examined by coculturing naïve B cells with Tfh1 cells. Results Tfh1 cell numbers were increased in the peripheral blood of patients, and activated Treg cell counts were decreased relative to Tfh1 cell counts. This imbalance in the Tfh to Treg ratio was remarkably pronounced in cases of lupus nephritis, especially in types III and IV active nephritis. Immunohistochemistry revealed Tfh1 cell infiltration in lupus nephritis tissues. Co-culture of Tfh1 cells (isolated from healthy individuals) with naïve B cells elicited greater induction of T-bet+ B cells than controls. In JAK/TYK2-dependent STAT phosphorylation assays using memory CD4+ T cells, IL-12-induced STAT1/4 phosphorylation and Tfh1 cell differentiation were inhibited by both JAK and TYK2 inhibitors. However, phosphorylation of STAT5 by IL-2 and induction of Treg cell differentiation by IL-2+TGFβ were inhibited by JAK inhibitors but not by TYK2 inhibitors, suggesting that TYK2 does not mediate the IL-2 signalling pathway. Conclusions Tfh1 cells can induce T-bet+ B cell production and may contribute to SLE pathogenesis-associated processes. TYK2 inhibitor may fine-tune the immune imbalance by suppressing Tfh1 differentiation and maintaining Treg cell differentiation, thereby preserving IL-2 signalling, unlike other JAK inhibitors.">

        <tr id="e14695 Background: PM1009 is an anti-TIGIT x PVRIG bispecific antibody containing a fully human anti-TIGIT IgG1 fused with a fully human anti-PVRIG scFv at the C terminus. PM1009 can potently block the TIGIT/CD155/CD112 and PVRIG/CD112 signaling pathways, and supports the depletion of TIGIT-positive Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment through FcγR engagement. This leads to the enhancement of T cell and NK cell activity towards the killing of tumor cells. PM1009 showed robust in vitro and in vivo efficacy with good safety in preclinical studies. Methods: This is the first-in-human study of PM1009, which includes a dose escalation stage (accelerated titration & 3+3 design) followed by dose expansion. In the dose escalation stage, PM1009 was administered as flat doses of 120, 300, 600 and 1200 mg for DLT evaluation after 3 weeks followed by administration Q2W. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, and the secondary endpoints were PK, ORR and DCR (per RECIST 1.1). Results: As of February 1, 2024, a total of 12 patients were enrolled for dose escalation and received at least one dose of PM1009, with 3 patients in each of the 120, 300, 600 and 1200 mg dose-levels. Median number of prior therapies was 5 lines (range 1- 9). No DLTs were observed up to 1200 mg. Any-grade TRAEs occurred in 11 patients (91.7%), and ≥ Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 2 patients (16.7%). Any-Grade irAEs occurred in 7 patients (58.3%), and ≥ Grade 3 irAEs occurred in 1 patient (8.3%). Treatment interruption due to TRAE occurred in 2 patients (16.7%), with infusion related reaction (the main symptom was nausea, and the single infusion was eventually completed), and neutrophil count decrease respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to TRAE occurred in 2 patients (16.7%), with acute myocardial infarction, and neutrophil count decrease respectively. The most common TRAEs were ALP elevation (33.3%) and AST elevation (25.0%). 12 patients completed at least one tumor evaluation. The DCR per RECIST 1.1 by investigator was 33.3% (4/12; 95% CI: 9.92 - 65.11), best overall response was SD. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional with a terminal half-life of 5.2-7.4 days across the dose range of 120-1200 mg. Conclusions: PM1009 was well-tolerated up to 1200 mg with signs of anti-tumor activity. These findings support further clinical investigation of PM1009 especially for the combination with chemotherapy or PD-1/L1-based checkpoint inhibitors. Clinical trial information: NCT05607563 .">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR T-cell) therapy has revolutionized the management of hematological malignancies. In addition to impressive malignancy-related outcomes, CAR T-cell therapy has significant toxicity-related adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), and opportunistic infections. Different CAR T-cell targets have different epidemiology and risk factors for infection, and these targets result in different long-term immunodeficiency states due to their distinct on-target and off- tumor effects. These effects are exacerbated by the use of multimodal immunosuppression in the management of CRS and ICANS. The most effective course of action for managing infectious complications involves determining screening, prophylactic, and monitoring strategies and understanding the role of immunoglobulin replacement and re-vaccination strategies. This involves considering the nature of prior immunomodulating therapies, underlying malignancy, the CAR T-cell target, and the development and management of related adverse events. In conclusion, we now have an increasing understanding of infection management for CAR T-cell recipients. As additional effector cells and CAR T-cell targets become available, infection management strategies will continue to evolve.">

        <tr id="e19060 Background: The current treatment regimen for DLBCL consisting of rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (RCHOP), is challenged by molecular and prognostic characterization of DLBCL. Activated B-cell (ABC) lymphoma has a significantly worse prognosis (5 yr OS rate: 45% - 56%) than germinal center B-cell (GCB) lymphoma (78% - 80%) after RCHOP treatment. Around 40% of patients ultimately relapse and/or develop primary refractory disease, cardiotoxicity and long-term secondary malignancies. Efforts are being made to improve the RCHOP backbone by including dose intensification and by the addition of new agents to increase the efficacy and reduced toxicity of RCHOP (McKelvey EM Cancer 1976; Wilson WH Blood 2002; Molina TJ JCO 2014; Coiffier B Hematology 2016). AVM0703, an immunomodulatory drug, mobilizes bispecific γδ and inv-TCR double-positive novel T and NKT cells. In a previous study employing an aggressive, immune resistant A20 mouse lymphoma model (Bascuas T J Transl Med. 2016), neoadjuvant AVM0703 was additive/synergistic, when cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (CyFlu) was dosed 3 and 24 hr later, with no additional toxicities. In the present study we combined AVM0703 with RCHOP to evaluate the efficacy in A20 mice model. Methods: 10 week old Balb/c mice were injected with 2x106 murine A20 B-cells in the flank and were randomized (1:1 male: female) into 1) Placebo 2) 3 cycles RCHOP 3) 3 cycles AVM0703 (18mg/kg HED) 4) 3 cycles AVM0703+RCHOP, when tumor size reached ~100 mm3. Mice who achieved complete remission (CR) were re-challenged at 21-25 wks later. Pre and post re-challenge, presence of memory cells was analyzed using flow cytometer. All mice were monitored continuously as per the IACUC protocol. Results: Mice treated with the combination of AVM0703+RCHOP achieved superior CR compared to RCHOP alone, which was not curative in any mice. In first phase of the study, 3 out of 11 AVM0703 +RCHOP treated mice showed CR after only 1-cycle. In second phase, 2 of 12 mice survived in CR for >150 days after 3 cycles, whereas no RCHOP mice survived beyond 2 cycles. AVM0703+RCHOP treated mice in long-term CR, had memory cells (CD44hi-Cd62low) pre- and post re-challenge, and no A20 engraftment, suggesting strong immunological memory induced by AVM0703+RCHOP. Conclusions: AVM+RCHOP demonstrated anti-tumor activity in A20 lymphoma mice, with reduced toxicity, compared to RCHOP. Larger preclinical studies are underway to confirm the activity of AVM0703+RCHOP against RCHOP resistant ABC DLBCL, and the potential to reduce total RCHOP exposure to only 3 cycles while maintaining or improving efficacy.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in treating various B-cell malignancies, redirecting T-cell cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. Despite its efficacy, CAR-T therapy is associated with potential risks, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and cytopenia. We present a case of a 69-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene-ciloleucel CAR-T therapy, who developed a rare and severe cutaneous toxicity resembling toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The patient exhibited persistent fevers, CRS, and subsequent development of a widespread erythematous macular eruption, progressing to vesiculation with bullae. Notably, allopurinol-induced TEN was considered with the patient's recent exposure to allopurinol, although the onset and minimal mucosal involvement did not align with typical presentations of allopurinol-induced cases. The cutaneous reaction, distinct from typical SJS/TEN, showed minimal mucosal involvement and coincided with the cytokine release storm, differing from allopurinol-induced TEN. Despite the absence of guidelines, the patient was managed with systemic steroids, achieving significant improvement. This case expands the spectrum of CAR-T therapy-related cutaneous toxicities, highlighting the need for early recognition of histopathology and tailored management by dermatologists. Further understanding of these reactions is crucial for optimizing the safety profile of this groundbreaking immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Despite significant advancements, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still remains characterized by a dismal prognosis in too many patients, and oftentimes, a cure can be achieved only after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), a procedure hampered by severe treatment-related complications. Despite this, new technologies have made it possible to harness the activity of the immune system against AML and use it as a new form of therapy, and intense research in the field has been made in recent years. This review aims to summarize the main concepts and strategies under study, considered from the point of view of the practicing hematologist, with special interest in the underlying biological principles and on treatment safety and efficacy. It will hopefully provide physicians, as well as the curious enthusiasts, with an updated, critically assessed description of immunotherapy as part of a more precise oncology approach to the treatment of AML. Abstract The potential of the immune system to eradicate leukemic cells has been consistently demonstrated by the Graft vs. Leukemia effect occurring after allo-HSCT and in the context of donor leukocyte infusions. Various immunotherapeutic approaches, ranging from the use of antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific T-cell engagers, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, and therapeutic infusions of NK cells, are thus currently being tested with promising, yet conflicting, results. This review will concentrate on various types of immunotherapies in preclinical and clinical development, from the point of view of a clinical hematologist. The most promising therapies for clinical translation are the use of bispecific T-cell engagers and CAR-T cells aimed at lineage-restricted antigens, where overall responses (ORR) ranging from 20 to 40% can be achieved in a small series of heavily pretreated patients affected by refractory or relapsing leukemia. Toxicity consists mainly in the occurrence of cytokine-release syndrome, which is mostly manageable with step-up dosing, the early use of cytokine-blocking agents and corticosteroids, and myelosuppression. Various cytokine-enhanced natural killer products are also being tested, mainly as allogeneic off-the-shelf therapies, with a good tolerability profile and promising results (ORR: 20–37.5% in small trials). The in vivo activation of T lymphocytes and NK cells via the inhibition of their immune checkpoints also yielded interesting, yet limited, results (ORR: 33–59%) but with an increased risk of severe Graft vs. Host disease in transplanted patients. Therefore, there are still several hurdles to overcome before the widespread clinical use of these novel compounds.">

        <tr id="e14508 Background: Despite significant advancements in cancer immunotherapy through the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, there remains a need for more robust strategies to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. This study introduces and characterizes OriA631-B, an innovative CD39/PD-L1 bispecific antibody. By simultaneously targeting the metabolic checkpoint CD39 and the immune checkpoint PD-L1, this novel antibody has the potential to significantly augment anti-tumor efficacy, particularly in cold tumors characterized by a scarcity of infiltrating immune cells. The development of OriA631-B marks a breakthrough in concurrently addressing two crucial immunosuppressive pathways. Methods: The creation of OriA631-B involved cutting-edge antibody engineering methodologies to guarantee optimal binding affinity and specificity for its target antigens, CD39 and PD-L1. With meticulous design and refinement, OriA631-B was developed to exhibit robust binding capabilities to both CD39 and PD-L1, enabling simultaneous and precise recognition. Leveraging advanced antibody engineering techniques was instrumental in crafting OriA631-B as a potent tool with heightened binding properties, broadening its potential applications across diverse therapeutic contexts. Results: In vitro investigations revealed the efficacy of OriA631-B, derived from the foundation of a clinically validated in-house generated PD-L1 antibody (YN035). This innovative antibody effectively thwarted CD39-mediated adenosine production, resulting in heightened effector T cell function and proliferation. In vivo efficacy assessments conducted on syngeneic hot tumor models MC38 and Hepa1-6 underscored the remarkable effectiveness of OriA631, the CD39 monoclonal antibody (mAb), in controlling tumor growth. Notably, OriA631-B, the CD39/PD-L1 bispecific antibody, exhibited even more profound impacts, significantly restraining tumor growth beyond the effects observed with single-target treatments in the hot tumor model or combination therapies in both the hot tumor model MC38 and the cold tumor model CT26. These findings underscore the potent therapeutic potential of OriA631-B and its capacity to exert robust anti-tumor activity by concurrently targeting CD39 and PD-L1. Additionally, safety profiling revealed an acceptable toxicity profile for OriA631-B, with no significant adverse events observed during the study. Conclusions: In summary, OriA631-B demonstrates potential as an innovative immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment by concurrently targeting CD39-mediated immune suppression and PD-L1-mediated T cell exhaustion. Further exploration, including clinical trials, is imperative to fully uncover the therapeutic capabilities of this groundbreaking bispecific antibody in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Therapeutic strategies against multiple myeloma (MM) have evolved dramatically in recent decades, with unprecedent results in the treatment landscape, culminating in the recent incorporation of novel agents in the anti-myeloma armamentarium. Areas covered BCMA represents one of the most promising targets in MM and currently available immune approaches, either approved or under active investigation, are clearly showing their greater potential over standard regimens. In this context, immunotherapies based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T-cells and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have taken center stage, being the ones that are yielding the most promising results in clinical trials. This review focuses on the current landscape of BsAbs and CAR-T, summarizing the latest advances and possible future developments. Expert opinion CAR-T and BsAbs anti-BCMA strategies represent breakthrough therapies against MM. However, their inclusion in clinical practice is almost feared, due to the associated limitations, some of which have been addressed here. Meanwhile, all the efforts should be focused on individualizing and choosing the most suitable candidates for each treatment and to understand how to combine, or sequence, these therapies to improve efficacy and minimize toxicity, especially for those patients with limited available treatment options.">

        <tr id="Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell and bispecific antibody (bsAb) therapies have been approved, demonstrating impressive clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Currently, these treatment share overlapping approval indications in the relapsed/refractory space, highlighting the importance of optimal selection and sequencing to maximize clinical efficacy. For patients previously unexposed to T-cell-directed therapies, several factors should be weighed when both options are available. These factors include access and logistical challenges associated with CAR T-cell therapy, disease-specific factors such as tempo of disease relapse, in addition to patient-specific factors such as frailty, and distinct toxicity profiles across these agents. Sequential therapy, whether it involves CAR T-cell therapy followed by bsAb or vice versa, has demonstrated clinical efficacy. When sequencing these agents, it is crucial to consider various factors that contribute to treatment resistance with careful selection of treatments for subsequent therapy in order to achieve favorable long-term patient outcomes.">

Autoimmune blistering diseases have a high morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic apheresis is an essential supportive treatment for severe and refractory dermatological diseases with an immunologic origin, particularly autoimmune blistering diseases. This approach has been shown to significantly improve the prognosis of these diseases. Therapeutic apheresis, combined with immunosuppressive therapy and/or human monoclonal antibodies, has treated successfully autoimmune blistering skin disorders. These diseases are caused by the immune system’s targeting of structural proteins in the skin and/or mucous membranes. Improved diagnostic methods have allowed to determine that the incidence and prevalence of these disorders have doubled in the last 15 years to 25 new cases per million people per year owing to an aging population. Over the last 45 years, therapeutic apheresis, in combination with immunosuppression and/or human monoclonal antibodies, has significantly increased survival rates. Therapeutic apheresis using hollow fiber modules is safe and highly effective in eliminating autoantibodies and other toxins from the bloodstream, leading to rapid clinical improvement in dermatological conditions.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptors are synthetically produced receptors engineered to engage with target cells with high specificity. These cells are created by inserting an artificial T-cell receptor into an immunoglobulin’s antigen-binding region, allowing the cells to combine and target specific antigens. The use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been a remarkable achievement in the field of immunotherapy, particularly in the treatment of ophthalmic tumors like retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma. However, there are some documented side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immunological effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Additionally, ocular side effects such as blurred vision, vision impairment, and intraocular infections are also concerning and require further evaluation. This review highlights the advances made in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy, including its structure and manufacture, as well as relevant clinical discoveries and associated adverse effects. By identifying the gaps in current research, this analysis provides insights into potential strategies and solutions for addressing some of the most severe side effects.">

        <tr id="11146 Background: Teclistamab (Tec) is the first B-Cell Maturation antigen (BCMA)xCD3 bispecific antibody FDA approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) in patients who have received ≥4 prior lines of therapy. The phase 1-2 MajesTec-1 study raised concerns for cytokine release syndrome (CRS)/immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). 48-hour inpatient observation is recommended for step-up dosing, which imposes financial and logistical burdens. We report our institutional experience with ambulatory Tec administration. Methods: Our inpatient/outpatient (IPOP) hybrid nursing unit is staffed with specialized nurses, advanced practice providers, and attending physicians. Our patients treated in IPOP must live within 1 hour of the hospital and have a 24-hour caregiver. Patients were treated with the recommended step-up dosing schedule. CRS grading and ICE scoring were performed daily. Both CRS and ICANS were graded according to the ASTCT grading systems. We collected toxicities until the second full treatment dose, at which point hospitalization is no longer recommended. Results: In total, 25 patients were treated with Tec between January 2023 to December 2023. The median age was 70 years old (range 59-89), with a median of 6 prior lines of therapy. One patient was dialysis dependent prior to starting Tec. All patients were triple class refractory. Thirteen patients (52%) received prior bone marrow transplant. One (4%) patient received prior anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy. Seventeen patients (68%) required admission during the Tec ramp-up period. CRS was observed in 15 (60 %) patients, all of which were grade I/II events. Fourteen of these patients were hospitalized for CRS. They were admitted for median number of 2 hospital days (range 1-6). Tocilizumab was administered for Grade 2 CRS in 3 patients (12%). ICANS was reported in 4 (16%) patients. Two of those patients developed Grade 2 ICANS which completely resolved with dexamethasone. The median number of admitted hospital days for these patients was 3 days (range 2-49). Neutropenia with ANC < 500 was seen in only 1 (4%) patient. Grade 3/4 infections were seen in 3 (12%) patients during the ramp-up period. Conclusions: Tec administration through an inpatient/outpatient hybrid model is safe and feasible. CRS was common but low grade and short lived. ICANS was observed, but remained low grade and may be attributable to our older patient population. As our center gained experience with the Tec management, we noticed lower rates of admission for low grade CRS. Lower incidences of infections and neutropenia demonstrate that these complications emerge in the months after starting therapy. Future studies will help identify patients who are higher risk for CRS and ICANS during ramp-up treatment and may pave the way for prophylactic interventions and outpatient administration.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across diverse malignancies. Notably, in patients with advanced gastric cancer, the use of programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade has significantly prolonged overall survival, marking a pivotal advancement comparable to the impact of Herceptin over the past two decades. While the therapeutic benefits of ICIs are evident, the increasing use of immunotherapy has led to an increase in immune-related adverse events. CASE SUMMARY This article presents the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer and chronic plaque psoriasis. Following sintilimab therapy, the patient developed severe rashes accompanied by cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Fortunately, effective management was achieved through the administration of glucocorticoid, tocilizumab, and acitretin, which resulted in favorable outcomes. CONCLUSION Glucocorticoid and tocilizumab therapy was effective in managing CRS after PD-1 blockade therapy for gastric cancer in a patient with chronic plaque psoriasis.">

        <tr id="Infections are increasingly recognized as a common complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. The incidence of clinically-defined infection after CD19.CAR T-cell therapy for relapsed/refractory lymphoma ranges from 60-90% in the first year after CAR T-cell therapy and is the most common cause for non-relapse mortality. However, infectious risk after CAR T-cell therapy targeting other malignancies is not well understood. Herein, we report for the first time, infectious complications after CD30.CAR T-cell treatment for patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Since CD30 is only expressed on a subset of activated T and B-cells, we hypothesized that CD30.CAR T-cell patients would have reduced incidence and severity of infections after infusion compared to CD19.CAR T-cell patients. We retrospectively evaluated all 64 patients who received CD30.CAR T-cells at a single institution between 2016-2021, and assessed infections within one year after cell infusion, comparing these data to a contemporary cohort of 50 patients who received CD19.CAR T-cells at the same institution between 2018-2021. 23 CD30.CAR T-cell patients (36%) and 18 CD19.CAR T-cell patients (36%) developed a microbiologically confirmed infection. Infection severity and bacterial infections were higher in the CD19.CAR T-cell group compared to CD30.CAR T-cell recipients who more commonly had grade 1 respiratory viral infections. Our data reflect expected outcomes for severity and infection type in CD19.CAR T-cell patients and provide a benchmark for comparison with the novel CD30.CAR T-cell product. Although our findings require replication in a larger cohort, they have implications for antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines after CD30.CAR T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="TPS5632 Background: Mucin 16 (MUC16) is a cell surface glycoprotein that is overexpressed in ovarian cancer (OC) and endometrial cancer (EC). Ubamatamab is a MUC16 × cluster of differentiation 3 (MUC16×CD3) bispecific antibody that bridges MUC16 on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells to promote T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Cemiplimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor, enhanced MUC16×CD3 activity in preclinical models. In Phase 1 of this first-in-human study (NCT03564340), ubamatamab alone and in combination with cemiplimab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, durable clinical activity across a range of doses, and linear pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients (pts) with recurrent OC (Liu et al. IGCS 2023. Plenary 03). Phase 2 will assess the efficacy of ubamatamab alone and in combination with cemiplimab in pts with recurrent OC. Ubamatamab will also be evaluated for recurrent advanced or metastatic EC that is MUC16+. Methods: For individuals with recurrent OC, elevated serum cancer antigen (CA)-125 ≥2× the upper limit of normal, and up to four prior lines of cytotoxic therapy, weekly dosing of ubamatamab alone or in combination with cemiplimab will be evaluated in monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts. A Phase 2 cohort will also be randomized 1:1:1 to receive ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W or 800 mg IV Q3W or ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W + cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W. For the EC cohort (≥25% of tumor cells MUC16+, as assessed by immunohistochemistry [IHC]) pts with advanced or metastatic EC that has progressed or is recurrent after prior anti–PD-1 therapy and prior platinum-based chemotherapy will be enrolled. The initial EC cohort will receive ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W. Based upon observed safety and activity, additional cohorts may be enrolled to receive ubamatamab 800 mg IV Q3W and/or ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W + cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W. To limit the risk of cytokine release syndrome, all pts will receive ubamatamab once-weekly step-up dosing prior to addition of cemiplimab and/or Q3W dosing. Expansion cohorts will use a Simon 2-stage study design, with an interim analysis after the first 20 pts. Any treatment arm with ≥3 objective responses may be expanded to 50 pts. In Phase 2, the primary endpoint will be the objective response rate for each arm (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints include duration of response and progression-free survival, safety, PK, and change from baseline in quality of life. Exploratory objectives include clinical correlation with serum CA-125, MUC16 IHC, and immune markers. The study is currently enrolling to these OC and EC expansion cohorts.

        <tr id="Bispecific and multispecific agents have become increasingly utilized in cancer treatment and immunotherapy, yet their complex design parameters present a challenge in developing successful therapeutics. Bispecifics that crosslink receptors on two opposing cells can provide specific activation of a receptor only when these cells are in close spatial proximity, such as an immune cell and cancer cell in a tumor. These agents, including T cell activating bispecifics, can avoid off-tumor toxicity through activation only in the tumor microenvironment by utilizing a tumor target to cluster T-cell receptors for a selective costimulatory signal. Here, we investigate a panel of PD-1/CD137 targeted Humabody VH domains to determine the key factors for T cell activation, such as affinity, valency, expression level, domain orientation, and epitope location. Target expression is a dominant factor determining both specificity and potency of T cell activation. Given an intrinsic expression level, the affinity can be tuned to modulate the level of activation and IC50 and achieve specificity between low and high expression levels. Changing the epitope location and linker length showed minor improvements to activation at low expression levels, but increasing the valency for the target decreased activation at all expression levels. By combining non-overlapping epitopes for the target, we achieved higher receptor activation at low expression levels. A kinetic model was able to capture these trends, offering support for the mechanistic interpretation. This work provides a framework to quantify factors for T cell activation by cell-crosslinking bispecific agents and guiding principles for the design of new agents.">

We investigated the effect of CNIs on immune tolerance after stem cell transplantation with discovery-based single-cell gene expression and T cell receptor (TCR) assays of clonal immunity in tandem with traditional protein-based approaches and preclinical modeling. While cyclosporin and tacrolimus suppressed the clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells during GVHD, alloreactive CD4+ T cell clusters were preferentially expanded. Moreover, CNIs mediated reversible dose-dependent suppression of T cell activation and all stages of donor T cell exhaustion. Critically, CNIs promoted the expansion of both polyclonal and TCR-specific alloreactive central memory CD4+ T cells (TCM) with high self-renewal capacity that mediated cGVHD following drug withdrawal. In contrast to posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), CSA was ineffective in eliminating IL-17A–secreting alloreactive T cell clones that play an important role in the pathogenesis of cGVHD. Collectively, we have shown that, although CNIs attenuate aGVHD, they paradoxically rescue alloantigen-specific TCM, especially within the CD4+ compartment in lymphoid and GVHD target tissues, thus predisposing patients to cGVHD. These data provide further evidence to caution against CNI-based immune suppression without concurrent approaches that eliminate alloreactive T cell clones.">

        <tr id="Aim – to evaluate myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subset counts and their suppressor potential in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) patients, as well as to analyze changes in the studied parameters in biological therapy (BT).Materials and methods. The study included 50 axSpA patients receiving 1st line therapy (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ±sulfasalazine/methotrexate) and 44 ageand sex-related healthy donors. Eight patients were initiated with BT (TNFαor IL-17 inhibitors). Peripheral blood granulocytic (G-MDSC), monocytic (M-MDSC) MDSCs, early-stage differentiation MDSCs (E-MDSC), and inhibitory molecule expression (PDL1, Arg-1, and IDO) were evaluated by flow cytometry.Results. The axSpA patients were characterized by increased G-MDSC counts (р<0.01), particularly manifested with high disease activity. Axial manifestation was associated with a combination of increased G-MDSC and E-MDSC numbers (р<0.05). The extra-axial group showed an isolated increase in G-MDSC (р<0.05), whereas coxitis was associated with an increase in both G-MDSC and M-MDSC (р<0.05). Low activity was associated with an isolated M-MDSC increase (р=0.045). Patients had reduced expression of majority of the studied suppressor molecules in MDSCs. Axial manifestation was characterized by a decreased expression of PDL1 and IDO in G-MDSCs and E-MDSCs (р<0.05), as well as Arg-1 in E-MDSCs and M-MDSCs (р<0.05). Patients with extra-axial manifestations (including coxitis) exhibited the most significant reduction in the expression of all three inhibitory molecules in M-MDSCs. High activity was associated with a decrease in PDL1+ G-MDSCs and E-MDSCs (р<0.05), as well as Arg-1and IDO-expressing M-MDSCs (р<0.05). In low disease activity, most of the analyzed parameters did not differ significantly from donor values, with the exception of a reduced Arg-1+ M-MDSC frequency (р=0.04). BT reduced G-MDSC counts in 75% of patients to levels comparable to those of healthy donors.Conclusion. Despite the reduced suppressor potential of MDSCs, patients undergoing first-line therapy with high activity demonstrated increased G-MDSC counts, while low activity axSpA was characterized by an isolated increase in M-MDSCs. The BT administration blocked G-MDSC accumulation.">

        <tr id="5096 Background: High-risk prostate cancer (HR-PCa) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Previous studies reported that a high density of immunosuppressive B cells in HR-PCa resection specimens was found to correlate with biochemical failure. In this context, a single arm prospective study assessing neoadjuvant rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody used to deplete B cells, was previously conducted on patients with HR-PCa eligible for radical prostatectomy (“PROTUX”). Here, we performed deep TCR sequencing to elucidate the impact of B cell depletion on T cells in prostate cancer patients. Methods: A single arm study enrolled patients with HR-PCa to receive neoadjuvant rituximab prior to radical prostatectomy (NCT: 01804712). Patients were treated with rituximab 375 mg/m2 once weekly for 4 treatments followed by prostatectomy within 14 days of the final treatment of rituximab. A matched cohort of patients with HR-PCa who underwent prostatectomy without any prior therapy were used as controls. Specimens from 14 patients were retrieved and genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Advanced UNG kit. TCR sequencing was performed with Adaptive Biotechnologies using the Ultradeep TCRB v4b assay. Data were then analyzed using the Adaptive immunoSEQ Analyzer. Groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis and graphing were done in Prism 10 and R. Results: We observed that patients treated with rituximab had higher TCRb productive clonality (0.080 vs 0.026, p = 0.03). Strikingly, the calculated number of T cells present in prostatectomy samples was significantly greater in patients receiving rituximab compared to controls (1.18 cells/ng DNA input vs 0.10 cells/ng, p = 0.002). Maximum productive frequency and the cumulative frequency of the top 10 clones were not significantly different between the two cohorts. However, we found that the T cells from patients who received rituximab had longer TCRb CDR3 regions (proportion CDR3 ≥16 amino acids of 0.232 vs 0.197, p = 0.007), suggesting a less antigen-experienced phenotype. Conclusions: Using specimens from a clinical trial assessing the use of neoadjuvant rituximab in HR-PCa, we found that B cell depletion can significantly affect T cell infiltration, clonality, and phenotype. Given the increasing appreciation for crosstalk between T cells and B cells in mediating anti-tumor immune responses, these findings suggest a context dependent role of B-cells in patients with HR-PCa.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Mogamulizumab is an anti-C-C chemokine receptor 4 antibody that is increasingly being used to treat T-cell malignancies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Because CCR4 is expressed on both malignant T-cells and regulatory T-cells (Tregs), mogamulizumab can be associated with increased immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While there is abundant literature on mogamulizumab-associated rash (MAR) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), other reported irAEs have not been collated into a single review.


AREAS COVERED
This narrative review covers irAEs associated with mogamulizumab in patients with T-cell lymphomas, focusing on events other than MAR and GVHD. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for case reports, case series, chart reviews, and clinical trials published from inception to March 2024. Identified events include alopecia, vitiligo, arthritis, psoriasis, myocarditis, myositis/polymyositis, hepatitis, and others.


EXPERT OPINION
Mogamulizumab's ability to augment the host immune response through Treg depletion adds to its efficacy but has wide-ranging implications for autoimmunity across multiple organ systems, similar to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Occurrence of irAEs may be associated with improved overall clinical response, although long-term follow-up studies are needed.">

CAR-T cell therapy, emerging as an efficient treatment option for patients with secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, is frequently complicated with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).


CASE PRESENTATION
We report a case of a 64-year-old woman with transformed follicular lymphoma, developing high-grade ICANS with eosinophilic pleocytosis following third-line therapy with CAR-T cells (tisagenlecleucel). During bridging therapy, she declined neurologically and was diagnosed with secondary CNS lymphoma. She received methotrexate-cytarabine-thiotepa-rituximab regimen with clinical and radiological improvement. Post-CAR-T cell infusion she developed cytokine release syndrome grade II and ICANS grade III. Given the lack of response to steroids, anakinra was initiated with complete ICANS resolution. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, performed only on day +10 due to thrombocytopenia, revealed eosinophils, while infections were excluded.


CONCLUSION
This report emphasizes the importance of CSF analysis in individuals with CAR-T-related neurotoxicity for elucidating the role of specific immune cells in such complications.">

        <tr id="7027 Background: Approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies targeting CD19 with a single co-stimulatory domain in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL) may face challenges including drug resistance and disease recurrence. This Phase 1 study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY007, a novel CD20-targeting CAR-T cell containing both OX40 and 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains to enhance CAR-T cell proliferation and anti-cancer cytotoxicity, for the treatment of r/r B-NHL pts. Methods: In this open-label, single-arm phase 1 trial, r/r B-NHL pts were infused with LY007 in 3 dose levels (DLs) (DL1, 0.5 x 106 cells/ kg; DL2, 1.5 x 106 cells/ kg; DL3, 5.0 x 106 cells/ kg) based on a standard 3+3 dose escalation design after cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion. The main objectives were to determine the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of LY007. The key eligibility criteria included pts with cytologically or histologically confirmed CD20 positive r/r B-NHL according to WHO 2016 including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL). Results: As of December 25th, 2023, 9 pts were treated with single LY007 infusions at 3 dose levels with a median follow-up of 5.09 (range 0.92-18.10) months. The median age of treated pts was 65 years (range, 44 to 69), and 44% (4/9) of pts had received three prior lines of therapy. Their B-NHL subtypes were all DLBCL. Among the treated pts, 78% (7/9) relapsed after prior lines of treatment, 89% (8/9) had extranodal involvement, 78% (7/9) had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of ≥ 2, and 44% (4/9) had a maximum tumor length of ≥ 5 cm. The overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) were 67% (6/9) and 33% (3/9) at day28, 83% (5/6), and 67% (4/6) at month 3 of the pts evaluable for efficacy. Among all study participants, the best reported ORR was 89% (8/9). The longest duration of remission was 12.3 months to date. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 100% and 88.9% at 6 months, respectively. The LY007 was generally well tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. And no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or G3+ cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported. The most common G3+ AEs were lymphopenia (9/9), leukopenia (9/9), and neutropenia (7/9). No pts discontinued, withdrew, or died due to AE. 6 pts experienced G1/2 CRS. Pts at all 3 dose levels had good CAR-T expansion and long-term persistence, particularly in the LD3 cohort, where the highest mean cell copy number of 93,750 copies/μg DNA was achieved at day 11 and was still detectable to date. Conclusions: This phase 1 trial demonstrated that LY007 was well tolerated at the dose levels up to 5.0 x 106 cells/ kg and showed a favorable dose-response relationship for the treatment of r/r B-NHL.

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy caused by the clonal expansion of immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary sites. Common manifestations of MM include anemia, renal dysfunction, infection, bone pain, hypercalcemia, and fatigue. Despite numerous recent advancements in the MM treatment paradigm, current therapies demonstrate limited long-term effectiveness and eventual disease relapse remains exceedingly common. Myeloma cells often develop drug resistance through clonal evolution and alterations of cellular signaling pathways. Therefore, continued research of new targets in MM is crucial to circumvent cumulative drug resistance, overcome treatment-limiting toxicities, and improve outcomes in this incurable disease. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the landscape of novel treatments and emerging therapies for MM grouped by molecular target. Molecular targets outlined include BCMA, GPRC5D, FcRH5, CD38, SLAMF7, BCL-2, kinesin spindle protein, protein disulfide isomerase 1, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, Sec61 translocon, and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. Immunomodulatory drugs, NK cell therapy, and proteolysis-targeting chimera are described as well.">

        <tr id="TPS5112 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies but application of CAR T cell therapy in solid malignancies remains a high priority. We previously demonstrated initial safety of a PSCA CAR T cells in patients with mCRPC following a reduced lymphodepletion regimen (LD) in a phase 1 trial (NCT03873805). There was preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity (Dorff 2023) but escalation was not pursued due to concerns of toxicity. Additional dose exploration is needed. Preclinical work suggests that radiation therapy directed to tumor sites modifies the tumor microenvironment providing rationale for combining metastasis directed radiation therapy (MDRT) with CAR T cell therapy. The phase 1b dose exploration study aims to test a multi-dose strategy and whether the addition of MDRT could further enhance response. Methods: This is a single-center, open-label, phase Ib trial for patients with PSCA+ mCRPC. Key inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of mCRPC with evaluable disease, at least one area of metastasis amenable for radiation (for the MDRT cohort), PSCA expression by immunohistochemistry on archival tissue, and prior progression on abiraterone or enzalutamide or both; prior taxane chemotherapy is allowed. The primary objective will be to assess the feasibility, safety, and activity of PSCA CAR T cell therapy. Primary endpoints will include evaluation of toxicity through DLT’s and activity through rate of PSA50 and objective responses. Secondary endpoints will include overall survival, progression-free survival (PCWG3 criteria), measurement of CAR T cell and cytokine kinetics, and T cell infiltration in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies. Exploratory endpoints will include phenotypes and frequencies of immune cell subsets in peripheral blood pre- and post-therapy, gene expression of CTCs, CAR immunogenicity by the presence of anti CAR antibodies or T cell mediated immune responses, urine analysis, cfDNA whole exome sequencing, and phenotype tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This study includes 2 treatment plans (TP). The participants on TP 1 will receive 50 million PSCA CAR T cells every 2 weeks for up to 6 doses after LD chemotherapy. Based on these results, the number of cycles of CAR T will be determined for TP2. Participants on TP 2 will receive PSCA CAR T therapy after MDRT and LD. The first 3 participants on each TP will be staggered, all further participants will be treated in cohorts of 3. Toxicities will be monitored based on a Wald sequential probability ratio test. Rates and associated 90% Clopper and Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated for DLTs within the DLT period, disease response based on PSA50/RECIST/PCWG3 criteria, PFS at 6 months, and OS at 1 year. The results will be used to identify the optimal strategy to move to phase 2. The study is currently open to enrollment. Clinical trial information: NCT05805371 .">

        <tr id="Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO), a novel therapeutic drug for relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RR)‑(ALL), is a humanized anti‑cluster of differentiation (CD) 22 monoclonal antibody conjugated with calicheamicin that causes DNA single‑ and double‑strand breaks. Although the efficacy of IO is significantly improved compared with that of conventional chemotherapies, the prognosis for RR‑ALL remains poor, highlighting the need for more effective treatment strategies. The present study examined the role of DNA damage repair inhibition using the poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib or talazoparib on the enhancement of the antitumor effects of IO on B‑ALL cells in vitro. The Reh, Philadelphia (Ph)‑B‑ALL and the SUP‑B15 Ph+ B‑ALL cell lines were used for experiments. Both cell lines were ~90% CD22+. The half‑maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of IO were 5.3 and 49.7 ng/ml for Reh and SUP‑B15 cells, respectively. The IC50 values of IO combined with minimally toxic concentrations of olaparib or talazoparib were 0.8 and 2.9 ng/ml for Reh cells, respectively, and 36.1 and 39.6 ng/ml for SUP‑B15 cells, respectively. The combination index of IO with olaparib and talazoparib were 0.19 and 0.56 for Reh cells and 0.76 and 0.89 for SUP‑B15 cells, demonstrating synergistic effects in all combinations. Moreover, the addition of minimally toxic concentrations of PARP inhibitors augmented IO‑induced apoptosis. The alkaline comet assay, which quantitates the amount of DNA strand breaks, was used to investigate the degree to which DNA damage observed 1 h after IO administration was repaired 6 h later, reflecting successful repair of DNA strand breaks. However, DNA strand breaks persisted 6 h after IO administration combined with olaparib or talazoparib, suggesting inhibition of the repair processes by PARP inhibitors. Adding olaparib or talazoparib thus synergized the antitumor effects of IO by inhibiting DNA strand break repair via the inhibition of PARP.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective first-line therapy for solid cancers. However, low response rate and acquired resistance over time has led to the need for additional therapeutic options. Here, we evaluated synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of EGFR x MET targeting bispecific antibody, amivantamab with PD-L1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tumor bearing humanized PDX models. We demonstrated that pembrolizumab or amivantamab alone was ineffective and that combination treatment induced a significant reduction of tumor growth in both models (p<0.0001 and p<0.01, respectively). It appeared that combination of amivantamab and pembrolizumab significantly enhanced infiltration of granzyme B-producing CD8 T cells was in the TME of HNSCC PDX (p<0.01), and enhanced neoantigen-associated central memory CD8 T cells in circulating immune cells. Analysis of single cell RNA transcriptomics suggested that the tumor cells dramatically upregulated EGFR and MET in response to PD-L1 immunotherapy, potentially creating a metabolic state fit for tumor persistence in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and rendered pembrolizumab ineffective. We demonstrated that EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster displayed an increased expression of genes implicated in production of lactate (SLC16A3 and LDHA) compared to the EGFRLOWMETLOW cluster. Accumulation of lactate in the TME has been associated with immunosuppression by hindering the infiltration of tumor killing CD8 T and NK cells. This study proved that amivantamab reduced glycolytic markers in the EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster including SLC16A3 and LDHA and highlighted remodeling of the TME by combination treatment, providing rationale for additional therapy of amivantamab with PD-1 immunotherapy.">

We report a case of successful anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory stiff-person syndrome (SPS). To investigate clinical and immunological effects of anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory SPS, a 69-y-old female with a 9-y history of treatment-refractory SPS with deteriorating episodes of stiffness received an infusion of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells (KYV-101) and was monitored clinically and immunologically for more than 6 mo. CAR T cell infusion resulted in reduced leg stiffness, drastic improvement in gait, walking speed increase over 100%, and daily walking distance improvement from less than 50 m to over 6 km within 3 mo. GABAergic medication (benzodiazepines) was reduced by 40%. KYV-101 CAR T cells were well tolerated with only low-grade cytokine release syndrome. This report of successful use of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in treatment-refractory SPS supports continued exploration of this approach in SPS and other B cell–related autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed by most immune cells, playing a role in negatively regulating immune responses. Studies in MRL/lpr lupus mice deficient for BTLA, indicate that BTLA has a protective role in lupus. We have previously shown an altered BTLA expression by regulatory T cells and an impaired capacity of BTLA to inhibit CD4+ T cell activation in lupus patients. In this study, we thoroughly analyzed BTLA expression and function in the NZB/W lupus-mouse model. We found that diseased NZB/W mice exhibit a BTLA expression and function pattern similar to that observed in lupus patients, emphasizing the importance of this mouse model in evaluating the therapeutic potential of targeting BTLA. Administration of a monoclonal anti-BTLA antibody (clone 6F7, which displays agonist properties ex vivo) into pre-diseased NZB/W mice resulted in a delayed onset of proteinuria, limited kidney damages and an increased survival rate compared to isotype-treated mice. This beneficial effect was associated with a decrease in circulating B cell frequency and required continuous exposure to the antibody. Regarding its mode of action, we demonstrated that the 6F7 antibody is not a depleting antibody and does not block HVEM binding to BTLA, but instead induces BTLA down modulation, leading to a selective reduction of follicular B cell numbers, and exhibits in vivo agonist activity. Overall, our data confirm the involvement of BTLA in lupus pathogenesis and provide the first evidence that BTLA is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of lupus.">

This study evaluates the role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) pathophysiology. The study included 133 untreated JDM children with an NK cell count evaluation before treatment. NK cell subsets (CD56low/dim vs. CD 56bright) were examined in 9 untreated children. CD56 and perforin were evaluated in situ in six untreated JDM and three orthopedic, pediatric controls. 56% of treatment-naive JDM had reduced circulating NK cell counts, designated “low NK cell”. This low NK group had more active muscle disease compared to the normal NK cell group. The percentage of circulating CD56low/dim NK cells was significantly lower in the NK low group than in controls (0.55% vs. 4.6% p < 0.001). Examination of the untreated JDM diagnostic muscle biopsy documented an increased infiltration of CD56 and perforin-positive cells (p = 0.023, p = 0.038, respectively). Treatment-naive JDM with reduced circulating NK cell counts exhibited more muscle weakness and higher levels of serum muscle enzymes. Muscle biopsies from treatment-naive JDM displayed increased NK cell infiltration, with increased CD56 and perforin-positive cells.">

        <tr id="e19015 Background: Anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin moxetumomab pasudotox (Moxe) was FDA-approved for relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL) but is now unavailable due to vial expiration until a company resumes development. The phase 3 complete remission (CR) rate was 41%, higher in patients with lower anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Minimal residual disease (MRD) eradication led to longer CR duration. HCL and the poorer prognosis variant HCLv strongly express CD22 and CD20. A clinical trial was done to determine if Rituximab could decrease immunogenicity by killing normal B-cells in HCL patients receiving Moxe and hasten MRD-free CR by reducing HCL tumor burden. Methods: To permit Rituximab enough time to reduce ADA and tumor burden, it was administered 3 days before cycle 1 day 1 at 375 mg/m2, and Moxe was given by 30-minute infusion days 1, 3 and 5. On subsequent 28-day cycles, patients received Moxe days 1, 3 and 5, and Rituximab prior to Moxe on day 1. Patients received up to 4 cycles past MRD-free CR, or up to 8 total cycles if MRD-free CR was achieved after cycle 4. The ADA assay determined percent neutralization by serum of the cytotoxicity of Moxe on CD22+ Raji cells. Results: After 13 patients received Moxe-Rituximab (MoxeR) without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), meeting the phase 1 endpoint, 5 additional patients received Moxe with the biosimilar Ruxience (MoxeR). The first 3 patients received Moxe at 30 mcg/Kg/dose and subsequent patients 40 mcg/Kg/dose. All 18 were evaluable for toxicity and response. Although no DLT, one patient had transient grade 3 hemolytic uremic syndrome during cycle 3 without significant symptoms or need for therapy. Of the 18 patients, 15 (83%) responded, 14 (78%) achieved CR and 13 (72%) MRD-free CR by blood and bone marrow (BM) aspirate flow cytometry and BM biopsy immunohistochemistry. MRD-free CRs included one with HCLv. Even though Moxe vial expiration prevented enrollment of the 26 planned patients needed for a 1-sided p-value <0.025 compared to Moxe alone where 30 (47%) of 64 phase 1-3 patients achieved MRD-free CR, the 53% relative improvement with MoxeR achieved a 1-sided p-value of 0.05. Compared to 29 (48%) of 61 evaluable phase 1-3 patients who received Moxe alone with high ADA levels, 4 (29%) of 18 patients had high ADA levels to MoxeR (p=0.048). At 14-51 (median 35.3) months of follow-up, all but 2 of 13 MRD-free CRs are continuing, with relapse-free survival 14-45 (median 34.5) months. Conclusions: Despite enrolling slightly fewer patients than planned, MoxeR was safe and more effective than Moxe alone at achieving MRD-free CR, probably due to lower immunogenicity and faster reduction of HCL/HCLv tumor burden. Since non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cells from patients are sensitive to Moxe like HCL, MoxeR could be tested after NHL treatment to convert MRD+ to MRD-free CRs.

        <tr id="Introduction Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) can simultaneously target two epitopes of different antigenic targets, bringing possibilities for diversity in antibody drug design and are promising tools for the treatment of cancers and other diseases. T-cell engaging bsAb is an important application of the bispecific antibody, which could promote T cell-mediated tumor cell killing by targeting tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and CD3 at the same time. Methods This study comprised antibodies purification, Elisa assay for antigen binding, cytotoxicity assays, T cell activation by flow cytometry in vitro and xenogenic tumor model in vivo. Results We present a novel bsAb platform named PHE-Ig technique to promote cognate heavy chain (HC)-light chain (LC) pairing by replacing the CH1/CL regions of different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the natural A and B chains of PHE1 fragment of Integrin β2 based on the knob-in-hole (KIH) technology. We had also verified that PHE-Ig technology can be effectively used as a platform to synthesize different desired bsAbs for T-cell immunotherapy. Especially, BCMA×CD3 PHE-Ig bsAbs exhibited robust anti-multiple myeloma (MM) activity in vitro and in vivo. Discussion Moreover, PHE1 domain was further shortened with D14G and R41S mutations, named PHE-S, and the PHE-S-based BCMA×CD3 bsAbs also showed anti BCMA+ tumor effect in vitro and in vivo, bringing more possibilities for the development and optimization of different bsAbs. To sum up, PHE1-based IgG-like antibody platform for bsAb construction provides a novel strategy for enhanced T-cell immunotherapy.">

Although standard treatment options such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), glucocorticoids (GCs), and other immunosuppressive or immune-modulating agents can help to manage symptoms, they do not offer a cure. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapies. In recent decades, cell therapies have been used for the treatment of SLE with encouraging results. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, mesenchymal stem cells, regulatory T (Treg) cell, natural killer cells, and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells are advanced cell therapies which have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials in humans. In clinical application, each of these approaches has shown advantages and disadvantages. In addition, further studies are necessary to conclusively establish the safety and efficacy of these therapies. This review provides a summary of recent clinical trials investigating cell therapies for SLE treatment, along with a discussion on the potential of other cell-based therapies. The factors influencing the selection of common cell therapies for individual patients are also highlighted.">

        <tr id="TPS7095 Background: The therapeutic landscape for relapsed and/or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is evolving to include targeted T-cell based immunotherapies. However, there remains an unmet medical need for patients who are refractory to, relapsing from, or are ineligible for these therapies. Leveraging natural killer (NK) cells emerges as a promising strategy, as demonstrated in a Phase 1 study with IPH6101/SAR’579 in R/R AML (Stein, ASCO 2023; Bajel, ASH 2023), and offers a novel approach that could complement or provide an alternative to T-cell therapies. IPH6501 is a first-in-class tetraspecific antibody-based NK cell engager that simultaneously targets the CD16a and NKp46 receptors on NK cells and CD20 on B-NHL cells. It also includes an engineered IL-2 variant designed with mutations to avoid binding to CD25 (IL-2Rα), limiting Treg activation and potential IL-2 related side effects, whilst inducing NK proliferation. In preclinical animal models, IPH6501 boosted NK cell proliferation and activation, and CD20+ target cell elimination in peripheral blood and tissues, at well-tolerated doses. In samples obtained from R/R B-NHL patients, IPH6501 demonstrated greater killing efficacy compared to a CD3xCD20 T-cell engager, and yet lower cytokine secretion, suggesting a potentially safer profile. Methods: This is a global first-in-human, multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety profile (DLTs and MTD), tolerability according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 and to determine the RP2D of IPH6501 for patients with B-NHL (NCT06088654). Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and evaluate the immunogenicity of IPH6501. Eligible subjects are aged ≥18 years with advanced, histologically confirmed, CD20+ B-NHL with an ECOG PS ≤2, and without established alternative therapy. Subjects must have received ≥2 prior systemic therapies which may have included astem cell transplant or CAR-T cell therapy. The Phase 1 part of the study will consist of a dose escalation part which will follow a3+3 design to determine the MTD or the highest dose to be tested as defined in protocol if the MTD has not been reached, and a dose assessment part to randomize ≥2 dose levels to determine the RP2D. The Phase 2 part will enroll one or more cohorts of selected B-cell NHL subtypes to be determined at a later stage. Up to 184 subjects will be enrolled, and the study is open in the United States, Australia and Europe. Clinical trial information: NCT06088654 .">

        <tr id="TPS6115 Background: Despite the excitement and approval of anti-PD1 therapy in first line setting of patients with aHNSCC, prognosis remains poor, with the majority experiencing disease progression after therapy. Consequently, novel strategies to improve treatment activity represent a critical and unmet need for this patient population. Cell therapies offer the advantage of a more personalized therapy for patients over standard immune checkpoint inhibitors. Historically, cell therapies have relied on bulk products that may not effectively select a tumor-reactive T cell population. TBio-4101 is produced by an industrialized manufacturing approach leveraging single-cell sorting of patient-specific neoepitope-reactive TIL with the potential to address immunologically ‘cold’ tumors. The TBio-4101 process specifically enriches polyclonal, polyfunctional, tumor-reactive T cells with an endogenous neoantigen-reactive T cell receptor repertoire that can target multiple tumor antigens. Non-tumor-reactive bystander T cells, which may negatively impact treatment efficacy via product dilution, and typically account for ≥90% of bulk TIL, are substantially reduced by this process. Inspired by the early academic clinically efficacious NCI selection and enrichment strategies (Tran et al 2014, 2016; Zacharakis et al, 2022), TBio-4101 is refined to better identify and potentially enrich to >70% tumor-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (median < 3% in bulk TIL). Methods: This is a Phase 1b, open-label, single-center study of TBio-4101 and pembrolizumab. Eligible patients are 18 to 75 years of age with aHNSCC. Prior to receiving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy as first line standard-of-care (SOC), these patients undergo tumor harvest for TILs followed by apheresis to collect monocytes. TILs are isolated from the tumor and expanded in vitro. Patient-specific neoepitopes are defined by whole exome and RNA sequencing of tumor versus germline to manufacture a peptide pool representing potential tumor-specific mutations. Monocytes isolated from apheresis are differentiated into dendritic cells, pulsed with the neoepitope peptides, and co-cultured with the TILs. Tumor-reactive T cells are specifically activated and selected based on upregulation of activation markers prior to expansion in culture.

        <tr id="Rituximab, targeting CD20, is one of the first-line treatments against Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Follicular Lymphoma, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (LPL), and other B cell mutations. As the patent on Rituximab expires and a large number of biosimilars are on the market, Rituximab is an important milestone in the era of immunotherapy as the first monoclonal antibody to be approved for oncology treatment. The mechanisms of its anticancer effects include Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC), Antibody-Dependent Phagocytosis (ADCP), direct signaling-induced cell death, etc. The biosimilar Truxima, which is now used worldwide, is also tending to surpass it by the expiration of the original Rituximab patent. This paper focuses on the working principle and clinical effects of Rituximab, the characteristics and pathway principles of the drug target CD20, as well as the physical and chemical properties of reference drugs and biosimilars. This review also summarizes the importance of monoclonal antibody technologies such as Rituximab and CD20 antibodies in the treatment of related cancers. Further studies are required for clinical applications of Truxima as a substitute for Rituximab.">

        <tr id="The treatment of CLL has evolved from traditional chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) to an increasing number of targeted and biologic approaches. Randomized trials have demonstrated superiority of covalent bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cBTKis) over CIT, and second-generation compounds such as acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib appear to have a more favorable efficacy/safety profile than ibrutinib. The noncovalent BTKi, pirtobrutinib, has shown impressive activity after failure of the cBTKis and is quite tolerable. The Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax plus a CD20, generally obinutuzumab, provides a high level of efficacy as initial treatment or after failure on a cBTKi, with many patients achieving a state of undetectable minimal residual disease. Promising novel approaches include BTK degraders, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T)-cell therapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common type of B cell neoplasm, and can be cured by traditional chemoimmunotherapy in 60–70% of cases. Relapsed/refractory patients usually have a dismal prognosis and most of them finally succumb to lymphoma. In the last decade, several new innovative therapies have been approved against DLBCL, targeting both surface antigens and the intracellular pathways of neoplastic B cells. Compared to standard chemotherapy, new monoclonal antibodies and engineered T cells have shown an increased response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival, but, on the other side of the coin, patients have been experiencing new kinds of toxicities, previously unknown, that clinicians have been learning to manage. Here, we review new drugs that are already approved or under investigation for DLBCL and the corresponding molecular target on lymphoma cells. Abstract Since the introduction of rituximab in the late 1990s, significant progress has been made in advancing targeted therapies for B cell lymphomas, improving patients’ chance of being cured and clinicians’ therapeutic armamentarium. A better understanding of disease biology and pathogenic pathways, coupled with refinements in immunophenotypic and molecular diagnostics, have been instrumental in these achievements. While traditional chemotherapy remains fundamental in most cases, concerns surrounding chemorefractoriness and cumulative toxicities, particularly the depletion of the hemopoietic reserve, underscore the imperative for personalized treatment approaches. Integrating targeted agents, notably monoclonal antibodies, alongside chemotherapy has yielded heightened response rates and prolonged survival. A notable paradigm shift is underway with innovative-targeted therapies replacing cytotoxic drugs, challenging conventional salvage strategies like stem cell transplantation. This review examines the landscape of emerging targets for lymphoma cells and explores innovative therapies for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). From Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cells to more potent monoclonal antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, and small molecules targeting intracellular pathways, each modality offers promising avenues for therapeutic advancement. This review aims to furnish insights into their potential implications for the future of DLBCL treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="TPS7093 Background: Approximately 30–40% of patients (pts) with high-risk, aggressive B-NHL are refractory to or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy. Although autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are available in the second line, access, eligibility, tolerability, and cost pose limitations for pts, and there remains a need for well-tolerated, effective off-the-shelf therapies in this setting. Odronextamab, a CD20×CD3 bispecific antibody, demonstrated encouraging clinical activity (complete response [CR] rate 31.5%; median duration of CR 17.9 months) and a generally manageable safety profile as monotherapy in pts with heavily pretreated R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the Phase 2 ELM-2 study (Ayyappan, et al. ASH 2023). This study will evaluate odronextamab versus SOC treatment in pts with DLBCL who have relapsed early (within 1 year) or were refractory to first-line therapy. Methods: OLYMPIA-4 (EudraCT 2022-502783-21-00) is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of odronextamab versus SOC in pts with previously treated aggressive B-NHL. Odronextamab will be administered intravenously in 21-day cycles, with step-up dosing during Cycle (C) 1 to mitigate the risk of cytokine release syndrome, at 160 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of C2–4, then as maintenance at 320 mg Q2W until one year from the start of treatment, progressive disease, or death. Treatment in the SOC arm consists of physician’s choice of salvage therapy with intent to proceed to ASCT. SOC regimens are: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE); dexamethasone, cisplatin, and cytarabine (DHAP); or gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP), ± rituximab. Pts will receive up to three 21-day cycles of salvage therapy, followed by ASCT. Pts without an optimal response to salvage therapy or ASCT may cross over to receive one year of odronextamab treatment. Key inclusion criteria: ≥18 years of age; aggressive B-NHL that is primary refractory or relapsed within one year of first-line treatment initiation; intent to proceed to ASCT; measurable disease; ECOG performance status 0–1; and adequate organ and hematologic function. Pts with central nervous system lymphoma or active infection are excluded. The primary endpoint is event-free survival, as assessed by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, best overall response, and change from baseline in physical function, as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30. Other secondary endpoints include CR rate, duration of response, overall survival, minimal residual disease, pharmacokinetics, and incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. The trial is currently recruiting and is expected to enroll ~216 pts at ~200 global sites. Clinical trial information: 2022-502783-21-00.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is a life-threatening, autosomal recessive syndrome caused by autoimmune regulator (AIRE) deficiency. In APS-1, self-reactive T cells escape thymic negative selection, infiltrate organs, and drive autoimmune injury. The effector mechanisms governing T-cell-mediated damage in APS-1 remain poorly understood.


METHODS
We examined whether APS-1 could be classified as a disease mediated by interferon-γ. We first assessed patients with APS-1 who were participating in a prospective natural history study and evaluated mRNA and protein expression in blood and tissues. We then examined the pathogenic role of interferon-γ using Aire-/-Ifng-/- mice and Aire-/- mice treated with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib. On the basis of our findings, we used ruxolitinib to treat five patients with APS-1 and assessed clinical, immunologic, histologic, transcriptional, and autoantibody responses.


RESULTS
Patients with APS-1 had enhanced interferon-γ responses in blood and in all examined autoimmunity-affected tissues. Aire-/- mice had selectively increased interferon-γ production by T cells and enhanced interferon-γ, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1), and CXCL9 signals in multiple organs. Ifng ablation or ruxolitinib-induced JAK-STAT blockade in Aire-/- mice normalized interferon-γ responses and averted T-cell infiltration and damage in organs. Ruxolitinib treatment of five patients with APS-1 led to decreased levels of T-cell-derived interferon-γ, normalized interferon-γ and CXCL9 levels, and remission of alopecia, oral candidiasis, nail dystrophy, gastritis, enteritis, arthritis, Sjögren's-like syndrome, urticaria, and thyroiditis. No serious adverse effects from ruxolitinib were identified in these patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that APS-1, which is caused by AIRE deficiency, is characterized by excessive, multiorgan interferon-γ-mediated responses. JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib in five patients showed promising results. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.).">

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers are molecular agents, usually antibody-based constructs, engineered to recruit immune cells against cancer cells and kill them. They represent a versatile and powerful tool for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the multiplication of new engagers tested and accepted in the clinics, how molecular and cellular parameters influence their action is poorly understood. In particular, disentangling the respective role of host immune cells and engager biophysical characteristics is needed to improve their design and efficiency. Focusing here on harnessing antibody dependent Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity, we measure the efficiency of 6 original bispecific antibodies (bsAb), associating an anti-HER2 nanobody and an anti-CD16 nanobody. In vitro cytotoxicity data using primary human NK cells on different target cell lines exposing different antigen densities were collected, exhibiting a wide range of bsAb dose response. In order to rationalize our observations, we introduce a simple multiscale model, postulating that the density of bsAb bridging the two cells is the main parameter triggering the cytotoxic response. We introduce two new microscopic parameters: the surface cooperativity describing bsAb affinity at the bridging step and the threshold of bridge density determining the donor-dependent response. Both parameters permit to rank Abs and donors and to predict bsAb potency as a function of antibodies bulk affinities and receptor surface densities on cells. Our approach thus provides a general way to decouple donor response from immune engagers characteristics, rationalizing the landscape of molecule design.">

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. Treatment with CM313, a novel anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, can result in targeted clearance of CD38-positive cells, including plasma cells.


METHODS
We conducted a phase 1-2, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CM313 in adult patients with ITP. CM313 was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg per kilogram of body weight every week for 8 weeks, followed by a 16-week follow-up period. The primary outcomes were adverse events and documentation of two or more consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter within 8 weeks after the first dose of CM313. The status of peripheral-blood immune cells in patients and changes in the mononuclear phagocytic system in passive mouse models of ITP receiving anti-CD38 therapy were monitored.


RESULTS
Of the 22 patients included in the study, 21 (95%) had two consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter during the treatment period, with a median cumulative response duration of 23 weeks (interquartile range, 17 to 24). The median time to the first platelet count of at least 50×109 per liter was 1 week (range, 1 to 3). The most common adverse events that occurred during the study were infusion-related reaction (in 32% of the patients) and upper respiratory tract infection (in 32%). After CD38-targeted therapy, the percentage of CD56dimCD16+ natural killer cells, the expression of CD32b on monocytes in peripheral blood, and the number of macrophages in the spleen of the passive mouse models of ITP all decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, anti-CD38 targeted therapy rapidly boosted platelet levels by inhibiting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on platelets, maintained long-term efficacy by clearing plasma cells, and was associated with mainly low-grade toxic effects.

We found that their epitopes are closely located, and we then engineered them as several bispecific antibodies (bsAbs). Neutralization and animal experiments indicated that bsAbs display more potent protective effects than the parental mAbs, and the cryoelectron microscopy structure of a bsAb3 Fab-Gn-Gc complex elucidated the mechanism of protection. In vivo virus passage in the presence of antibodies indicated that two bsAbs resulted in less selective pressure and could efficiently bind to all single parental mAb-escape mutants. Furthermore, epitope analysis of the protective mAbs against SFTSV and RVFV indicated that they are all located on the Gn subdomain I, where may be the hot spots in the phleboviruses. Collectively, these data provide potential therapeutic agents and molecular basis for the rational design of vaccines against SFTSV infection.">

        <tr id="2520 Background: MCLA-145, a human common light chain bispecific antibody targeting CD137 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, is designed to enhance both antigen-mediated T cell activation via CD137 costimulation, and blockade of inhibitory PD-L1. Interim data from the ongoing phase 1 study (NCT03922204) are presented. Methods: Patients (pts) with PD-L1 ≥1% advanced/metastatic solid tumors received MCLA-145 IV as monotherapy Q2W/Q3W in 21/28-d cycles respectively, or in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W in 21-d cycles. Pts enrolled in combination had cancers that either relapsed after PD-(L)1 therapies or were immunotherapy naïve. Primary objectives are safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of MCLA-145 alone or combined with pembrolizumab, and determination of the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Secondary endpoints include efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity. Results: As of a December 4, 2023 data cutoff, 72 pts with 26 cancer types were treated; 25% of pts had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 3 pts were continuing combination therapy. Monotherapy: 53 pts (median age 60 y, 49% male) were treated across 8 dose levels (47 pts 0.4-75 mg Q2W, 6 pts 40 mg Q3W). Median number of cycles was 2 (range 1-39). 6 pts had DLTs in the 25-75 mg dose range (febrile neutropenia [2 pts], hemolytic anemia, myositis, ALT/AST increase, neutrophil/platelet decrease [1 pt each]). Most common adverse events (AEs; all grades/G3-4) were fatigue (51%/4%), decreased appetite (34%/2%), dyspnea (32%/0%), anemia (30%/9%), ALT/AST increase (25%/11%), and pyrexia (25%/0%). The incidence of any G3-4 AE was lower with 40 mg Q3W than across all Q2W dose levels (33% vs 66%). Combination: 19 pts (median age 61 y, 47% male) were treated with MCLA-145 10, 25 or 40 mg plus Q3W. Median number of cycles was 5 (range 1-16). No DLTs occurred. Most common AEs (all grades/G3-4) were fatigue (58%/11%), cough (42%/0%), constipation (32%/0%) and ALT/AST increase (21%/11%). The RDE was established at 40 mg Q3W for both monotherapy and combination. Preliminary antitumor activity was observed with monotherapy (52 evaluable pts): 5 partial responses (PRs) in glioblastoma (lasting >3 y), sarcoma, cervical, anal, and gastric cancer (treated for 2-11 mo); and combination (19 evaluable pts): 1 PR in Merkel cell carcinoma (treated 12+ mo), 1 complete response in PD-L1+ NSCLC (treated 6+ mo), both after prior immunotherapy. Disease control rate was 37% with monotherapy and 68% with combination. Exposure was dose-dependent with a terminal half-life of 69 h at 75 mg. Measure of peripheral blood Ki67+ CD8 T cells supports maximal PD activity at 40 mg. Conclusions: MCLA-145 given alone or in combination with pembrolizumab had a well-tolerated and manageable safety profile with encouraging clinical activity, including in pts who relapsed after PD-(L)1 therapies.

        <tr id="Background Treatment strategies for Crohn’s disease (CD) suppress diverse inflammatory pathways but many patients remain refractory to treatment. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has emerged as a therapy for medically refractory CD. SCT was developed to rescue cancer patients from myelosuppressive chemotherapy but its use for CD and other immune diseases necessitates reimagining SCT as a cellular therapy that restores appropriately responsive immune cell populations from hematopoietic progenitors in the stem cell autograft (i.e. immune “reset”). Here we present a paradigm to understand SCT as a cellular therapy for immune diseases and reveal how SCT re-establishes cellular immunity utilizing high-dimensional cellular phenotyping and functional studies of the stem cell grafts. Methods Immunophenotyping using CyTOF, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing was performed on peripheral blood and intestinal tissue samples from refractory CD patients who underwent SCT. The stem cell graft from these patients was analyzed using flow cytometry and functionally interrogated using a murine model for engraftment. Results Our study revealed a remodeling of intestinal macrophages capable of supporting mucosal healing that was independently validated using multimodal studies of immune reconstitution events including CyTOF and scRNA-seq. Functional interrogation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using a xenograft model demonstrated that HSCs shape the timing of immune reconstitution, the selected reconstitution of specific cell lineages and potentially the clinical efficacy of SCT. Conclusions These studies indicate that SCT serves as a myeloid-directed cellular therapy re-establishing homeostatic intestinal macrophages that support intestinal healing and suggest refractory CD evolves from impairment of restorative functions in myeloid cells. Furthermore, we report heterogeneity among HSCs from CD patients which may drive SCT outcomes and suggests an unrecognized impact of CD pathophysiology on HSC in the marrow niche.">

        <tr id="e20518 Background: Treatment choice for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after front-line immuno-chemotherapy therapy is limited. As the first approved dual programmed cell death-1(PD-1) / cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) bispecific antibody worldwide, cadonilimab combined with anlotinib, a vascular epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, showed potential anti-tumor activity in advanced NSCLC patients resistant to anti-PD-1/ programmed cell death ligand-1(PD-L1) antibodies in a phase Ib/II clinical trial. Methods: We retrospectively collectedthe efficacy and safety data in advanced NSCLC patients treated with cadonilimab in later therapy lines. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS). Results: Totally, 41 advanced NSCLC patients who were refractory to previous chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and treated with later line cadonilimab-based regimens were enrolled. More than half of patients received cadonilimab as a fourth or later line of treatment. Until the data cut-off date (August 29, 2023), the treatment efficacy of 23 patients could be evaluated. One (4.3%) patient had partial response, 8 (34.8%) patients had stable disease, and 14 (60.9%) patients progressed. The ORR and DCR were 4.3% and 39.1%, respectively. The median PFS of all evaluated patients was 108.0 days (95% confidence interval: 62.3-153.7). Due to the short follow-up, median OS has not been reached yet. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occurred in 26(63.4%) and 9(22%) patients, respectively. The most common AEs included gamma-glutamyl transferase elevation (17.1%), coughing (14.6%), and fatigue (12.2%). Five patients (12.2%) experienced grade≥3 AEs. Two patients temporarily paused medication due to Grade 2 rash. One patient and 2 patients permanently discontinued medication due to Grade 3 myocarditis and Grade 2 infusion reactions, respectively. Metabolomics results showed that lipids and lipid-like molecules were rich in stools of patients responsive to cadonilimab treatment. Conclusions: In this heavily treated advanced NSCLC patient cohort, cadonilimab-based regimens only showed moderate anti-tumor efficacy with a generally tolerable and manageable safety profile. More evidence supporting administration of cadonilimab is needed in NSCLC patients refractory to previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.">

        <tr id="We report on the first-in-human clinical trial using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD37, an antigen highly expressed in B- and T-cell malignancies (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04136275). Five patients with relapsed or refractory CD37+ lymphoid malignancies were enrolled and infused with autologous CAR-37 T-cells. CAR-37 T-cells expanded in the peripheral blood of all patients and, at peak, comprised >94% of the total lymphocytes in 4/5 patients. Tumor responses were observed in 4/5 patients, with 3 complete responses, 1 mixed response, and 1 patient whose disease progressed rapidly and with relative loss of CD37 expression. Three patients experienced prolonged and severe pancytopenia, and in two of these patients, efforts to ablate CAR-37 T-cells (which were engineered to co-express truncated EGFR) with cetuximab, were unsuccessful. Hematopoiesis was restored in these two patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No other severe, non-hematopoietic toxicities occurred. We investigated the mechanisms of profound pancytopenia and did not observe activation of CAR-37 T-cells in response to hematopoietic stem cells in vitro or hematotoxicity in humanized models. Patients with pancytopenia had sustained high levels of IL-18, with low levels of IL-18 binding protein in their peripheral blood. IL-18 levels were significantly higher in CAR-37-treated patients relative to both cytopenic and non-cytopenic cohorts of CAR-19-treated cohorts of patients. In conclusion, CAR-37 T-cells exhibited anti-tumor activity, with significant CAR expansion and cytokine production. CAR-37 T-cells may be an effective therapy in hematologic malignancies as a bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transplant.">

        <tr id="7559 Background: The B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted antibody drug conjugate belantamab mafodotin enhances cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Elotuzumab, a signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 7 (SLAMF7) checkpoint inhibitor, activates NK cells and induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Bela-Elo (NCT05002816) is an ongoing phase Ib/II trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the unique combination of these two agents in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma (RRMM). We report data from phase I part of this trial. Methods: This single-arm phase Ib/II study is enrolling patients with triple-class refractory RRMM. Patients with progression after prior BCMA-targeted therapy are eligible. Elotuzumab is administered via intravenous (IV) infusion at an established dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 every 28 days for cycles 1 and 2; followed by 20mg/kg on day 1 of each 28-day cycle. Belantamab mafodotin is administered via IV infusion with the starting dose of 1.9 mg/kg IV at every 4-week interval, with subsequent dose-reduction based on toxicity. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demographics and safety and efficacy outcomes. Results: As of data cut-off (January 20, 2024) 12 subjects have been enrolled; and 10 subjects received treatment on study. Median age of patients was 66.5 years (range 59-79). The patient population was heavily pretreated with 5 prior median lines of therapy (range 2-8); 40% (4/10) of patients were refractory to prior BCMA-targeted therapy (2 post-BCMA bispecific antibody, 2 post-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy [CART]). Phase I part of the study has completed. Median duration of treatment was 4 months (range 2-19). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Four severe adverse events were observed possibly related to the study treatment in 3 patients, including grade 3 pulmonary infection (n=1) and lymphopenia (n=3). Ocular keratopathy developed in 40% of patients, all were grades 1-2 and resolved after discontinuation or dose-reduction of belantamab. Preliminary activity is noted with partial responses (PR) in 4/10 (40%) and stable disease (SD) in additional 3/10 (30%) of patients. Among the four patients who were refractory to prior BCMA therapy, 2 (50%) achieved PR, with duration of response (DOR) of 19 months and 9 months, respectively. Conclusions: This novel combination immune therapy with belantamab mafodotin and elotuzumab appears to have an encouraging safety profile and a promising preliminary efficacy in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM, including in those with prior failure of BCMA-targeted therapy.

        <tr id="Adoptive immunotherapy with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-specific T cells is an effective treatment for relapsed or refractory EBV-induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) with overall survival rates of up to 69%. EBV-specific T cells have been conventionally made by repeated stimulation with EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), which act as antigen-presenting cells. However, this process is expensive, takes many months, and has practical risks associated with live virus. We have developed a peptide-based, virus-free, serum-free closed system to manufacture a bank of virus-specific T cells (VST) for clinical use. We compared these with standard LCL-derived VST using comprehensive characterization and potency assays to determine differences that might influence clinical benefits. Multi-parameter flow cytometry revealed that peptide-derived VST had an expanded central memory population and less exhaustion marker expression than LCL-derived VST. A quantitative HLA-matched allogeneic cytotoxicity assay demonstrated similar specific killing of EBV-infected targets, though peptide-derived EBV T cells had a significantly higher expression of antiviral cytokines and degranulation markers after antigen recall. High-throughput T cell receptor-beta (TCRβ) sequencing demonstrated oligoclonal repertoires, with more matches to known EBV-binding complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences in peptide-derived EBV T cells. Peptide-derived products showed broader and enhanced specificities to EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) in both CD8 and CD4 compartments, which may improve the targeting of highly expressed latency antigens in PTLD. Importantly, peptide-based isolation and expansion allows rapid manufacture and significantly increased product yield over conventional LCL-based approaches.">

        <tr id="7024 Background: The EHA/EBMT immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT) grading system characterizes hematotoxicity after CAR T-cell therapy based on depth and duration of neutropenia (Rejeski et al, Blood, 2023). We evaluated pre- and post-infusion factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT and developed a predictive model in 602 patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing CAR T-cell therapy at Fred Hutch Cancer Center. Methods: Grading of early hematotoxicity (day-0-30 after CAR T-cell cell infusion) was automated using the heatwaveR package. Associations with 50 patient, disease-related, and laboratory factors, and grade 3-4 ICAHT were modeled using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results: The most common disease types were aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 293; 49%), indolent NHL (n = 150; 25%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 94; 16%). The most common CAR T-cell products were the investigational CD19 CAR T-cell product JCAR014 (n = 197; 33%), axicabtagene ciloleucel (n = 129; 21%), and lisocabtagene maraleucel (n = 73; 12%). Incidences of early ICAHT grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 319 (53%), 96 (16%), 60 (10%), and 35 (6%) patients, respectively. Baseline patient factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT included ALL (reference: aggressive NHL, OR = 4.18, 95% CI, 2.41-7.26, p < 0.001) , Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.07-4.20, p = 0.025), and lower age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.02-1.05, p < 0.001). Pre-lymphodepletion (LD) laboratory factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT in univariate analyses included lower ANC (OR = 6.67 per log10 cells/μL, 95% CI, 4.0-11.1, p < 0.001), LDH (OR = 8.70per log10U/L, 95% CI, 4.03-19.4, p < 0.001), CRP (OR = 3.18 per log10mg/L, 95% CI, 2.06-5.07, p < 0.001), and ferritin (OR = 6.07 per log10mg/L, 95% CI, 3.65-10.6, p < 0.001). Peak CRP (OR = 15.6, 95% CI, 7.27-36.4, p < 0.001), peak ferritin (OR = 7.41, 95% CI, 5.02-11.3, p < 0.001), peak CRS grade (OR = 2.01, 95% CI, 1.59-2.56, p < 0.001), and peak ICANS grade (OR = 1.51, 95% CI, 1.29-1.77, p < 0.001) after CAR T-cell infusion were also strongly associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT. A multivariable model using restricted cubic splines and including disease type, pre-LD ANC, pre-LD LDH, peak CRP, peak ferritin, and CRS grade demonstrated high discrimination to predict grade 3-4 ICAHT (C-index = 0.89). Internal validation using bootstrapping showed near-perfect calibration without overfitting. Sensitivity and specificity based on the Youden criteria was 74% and 90%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the CAR-HEMATOTOX score in predicting grade 3-4 ICAHT was 93% and 30%, respectively. Conclusions: We identified pre- and post-infusion predictors of grade 3-4 ICAHT and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model including disease-type, pre-LD ANC, pre-LD LDH, peak CRP, peak ferritin, and CRS grade. We plan to further evaluate our model in an external cohort.">

        <tr id="9507 Background: IMC-F106C is a novel ImmTAC bispecific protein (PRAME × CD3). Dose escalation results showed robust T cell activation, T cell infiltration into tumor, and clinical activity in various solid tumors (NCT04262466; Hamid 2022). We present updated CM data from monotherapy (mono) and anti-PD1 combination (combo) cohorts. Methods: HLA-A*02:01+ unresectable/metastatic (m) CM patients (pts) previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were eligible. Primary objectives were safety and selection of recommended dose; additional objectives were efficacy and ctDNA response (Natera, Guardant). Stable disease (SD) with any tumor reduction confirmed with ≥ 1 subsequent scan was analyzed based on association with overall survival (OS) for tebentafusp. Molecular response was defined ≥ 0.5 log [68%] ctDNA reduction by week 9. PRAME was tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC; PRAME+ defined as H-score ≥1). Efficacy is presented by PRAME− and PRAME+ (documented + and unknown) groups. IMC-F106C dosed IV with 2 step-up doses and weekly target dose (20-320 mcg mono, 160 mcg combo). Pembrolizumab (pembro) dosed at IV 400 mg Q6W. Data cutoff: Dec 2023. Median follow-up of mono was 11 months. Results: 46 mCM pts (40 mono, 6 combo) received IMC-F106C ≥ 20 mcg. All mono pts received prior ICI (100% anti-PD1, 88% anti-CTLA4); 25% had prior BRAF/MEK inhibitors. 35/40 mono pts were grouped by IHC as positive (25 PRAME+, 10 unknown) vs. 5 PRAME−. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with prior experience. Most common AE was Grade 1/2 CRS (50%); mostly in first 3 weeks. No drug related AEs led to treatment discontinuation or death. Safety for pembro combo to date was consistent with the individual agents. 31/40 mono pts had a RECIST evaluable tumor assessment. The clinical benefit rate (CBR) of PR + SD was 61% (19/31). 35% (11/31) had any tumor reduction that was confirmed on ≥ 1 subsequent scan, including 4 PR (ORR 13%) and 7 SD (26 of 31 pts were PRAME+; the CBR in these was 65% and included all 11 (42%) with confirmed tumor reduction. In 5 PRAME−, there was no tumor reduction. Both median progression free survival (PFS) and 6-month OS rates were higher in PRAME + vs –: 4.5 vs 2.1 months and 94% vs 40%, respectively. 12/40 mono pts received therapy for > 6 months and 14/40 mono pts remain on therapy. 41% of ctDNA-evaluable, PRAME+ mono pts had a molecular response (9/22); this was associated with longer PFS and OS. Correlative biomarkers will be shared. Conclusions: IMC-F106C was well tolerated with promising clinical activity in ICI-pretreated, mCM patients without clinical options. Clinical activity, measured by any confirmed tumor reduction and ctDNA molecular response, is enriched in PRAME+ patients at ~40% and associated with longer PFS and OS. IMC-F106C can be combined with anti-PD1. A Ph 3 trial of IMC-F106C with nivolumab in 1st line mCM has been initiated (PRISM-MEL301; NCT06112314). Clinical trial information: NCT04262466 .">

        <tr id="Allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells offer many advantages over autologous therapies, but their benefits are curtailed by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and elimination by recipient immune cells. Moreover, just as with autologous therapies, allogeneic CAR T cells are susceptible to activation-induced cell death (AICD) caused by chronic antigen exposure (CAE). Granzyme B (GzmB) and Fas/FasL-initiated, caspase-mediated apoptosis are key mechanisms of T-cell death caused by T/NK cell-mediated allorejection or CAE. We explored a protective strategy of engineering CAR T cells to overexpress variants of the GzmB-specific serine protease inhibitor, SerpinB9 (SB9), to improve allogeneic T-cell persistence and antitumor efficacy. We showed that the overexpression of an SB9 variant with broadened caspase specificity, SB9(CAS), not only significantly reduced rejection of allogeneic CAR T cells, but also increased their resistance to AICD and enabled them to thrive better under CAE, thus improving allogeneic T-cell persistence and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, while SB9(CAS)-overexpression improved the efficacy of allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy by conferring protection to cell death, we did not observe any autonomous growth and the engineered CAR T cells were still susceptible to an inducible suicide switch. Hence, SB9(CAS)-overexpression is a promising strategy that can strengthen current development of cell therapies, broadening their applications to address unmet medical needs.">

        <tr id="The activity of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with Richter's transformation (RT) to aggressive large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) is largely unknown. In a multicenter retrospective study, we report the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in patients with RT (n=30) compared to patients with aggressive B cell lymphoma (n=283) and patients with transformed indolent Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (iNHL) (n=141) between April 2016 and January 2023. Two-thirds of patients received prior therapy for CLL before RT and 89% of them received B-cell receptor and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. Toxicities of CAR T cell therapy in RT were similar to other lymphomas, with no fatalities related to cytokine release syndrome or immune effector-cell associated neurotoxicity synderome. The 100-day overall response rate and complete response rates in patients with RT were 57% and 47%, respectively. With a median follow up of 19 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months in patients with RT compared to 18 months in de-novo LBCL and not reached in patients with transformed iNHL. The OS at 12 months was 45% in patients with RT compared with 62% and 75% in patients with de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, worse OS was associated with RT histology, elevated LDH, and more prior lines of therapy. CAR T cell therapy can salvage a proportion of patients with CLL and RT exposed to prior targeted agents; however, efficacy in RT is inferior compared to de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL.">

        <tr id="Globally, the efforts to find the best cancer treatment are demanding and very intensive. Immunotherapy has gained an important role as a second or sometimes first line of treatment for various types of cancer. PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are an impending category of immunotherapy, and their mechanism, as well as their interaction with T cells, are well studied. However, our knowledge about any possible effect(s) of immunotherapy on B cells is limited. In this prospective study, we asked the question of any possible alterations of circulating B cells (numbers and subsets) occurring during immunotherapy in patients with cancer and of the potential correlation of such changes with the outcomes and with development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We enrolled 20 cancer patients who received PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors and 8 healthy donors (HD). Patients underwent regular clinical assessment and imaging using the iRECIST criteria for 6 months following immunotherapy. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and during PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed, evaluating various circulating B cell subset phenotypes, including mature naïve B cells, memory B cells, regulatory B cells (Bregs), antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and age-related B cells (ABCs). Statistical analysis was employed to compare the differences of B cells between different groups and among sequential data within the same group. Total circulating CD19+ B cell counts remained stable across both groups (responders (R), nonresponders (NR)) and timepoints. However, there was a significant rise in mature naïve B cells and decline in memory B cells at the initiation of the treatment in the R group compared to healthy donors and to the NR group. Such changes were correlated with a good response to immunotherapy. On the contrary, higher numbers of ABCs at baseline were seen in the NR group and were correlated with resistance to treatment. As far as immune-related adverse events are concerned, no significant changes were recorded among the different B cell subpopulations evaluated in both groups. Our study provides preliminary data suggesting that B cell subset changes during immunotherapy may correlate with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced clinical responses in patients with neoplasia. Further investigations to delineate the potential role(s) of B cells in patients undergoing immunotherapy are needed.">

        <tr id="Introduction Therapeutic antibodies have become a major strategy to treat oncologic diseases. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia, antibodies against CD20 are used to target and elicit cytotoxic responses against malignant B cells. However, efficacy is often compromised due to a suppressive microenvironment that interferes with cellular immune responses. To overcome this suppression, agonists of pattern recognition receptors have been studied which promote direct cytotoxicity or elicit anti-tumoral immune responses. NOD2 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that participates in the detection of peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls. This detection then mediates the activation of multiple signaling pathways in myeloid cells. Although several NOD2 agonists are being used worldwide, the potential benefit of these agents in the context of antibody therapy has not been explored. Methods Primary cells from healthy-donor volunteers (PBMCs, monocytes) or CLL patients (monocytes) were treated with versus without the NOD2 agonist L18-MDP, then antibody-mediated responses were assessed. In vivo, the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL was used to test the effects of L18-MDP treatment alone and in combination with anti-CD20 antibody. Results Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with L18-MDP led to activation of monocytes from both healthy donors and CLL patients. In addition, there was an upregulation of activating FcγR in monocytes and a subsequent increase in antibody-mediated phagocytosis. This effect required the NF-κB and p38 signaling pathways. Treatment with L18-MDP plus anti-CD20 antibody in the Eµ-TCL model of CLL led to a significant reduction of CLL load, as well as to phenotypic changes in splenic monocytes and macrophages. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that NOD2 agonists help overturn the suppression of myeloid cells, and may improve the efficacy of antibody therapy for CLL.">

        <tr id="e19005 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor modified R Cell Immunotherapy (CAR-T) cell products have revolutionized the landscape of treatment of relapsed and refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma. Yet, these therapies emerged with their own challenges, Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are the most common and serious adverse events. The model of CAR-T cell therapy in the University of Oklahoma is unique as it is designated as an outpatient therapy. Little is known regarding risk factors for hospitalization after CAR-T therapy. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of all consecutive adult patients who had CAR-T therapy from 9/1/2019 through 9/30/2023 at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC). Inclusion criteria were adult patients with hematologic malignancies who received an FDA approved CAR-T therapy. Exclusion criteria included patients who were younger than 18 at the time of infusion, those who received cellular therapy for solid tumors and those who received investigational CAR-T cell products. Descriptive statistics were created for continuous and categorical variables. Chi-Square analysis and independent samples t-tests were used to measure association with hospital admission and treatment response. Logistic regression was used to explore associations for all covariates with each outcome. SAS 9.4 was used to perform all analysis. An alpha of 0.05 was used to determine significance. Results: A total of 118 patients received outpatient CAR-T/Cellular therapy at OUHSC during the study period with 78 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The mean age at time of infusion was 58.6 (range=18-85) with most being male (n=46, 59.0%), White (n=63, 80.8%), and overweight/obese (n=50, 64.1%). The majority of patients received anti CD19 CAR-T (n=64, 82.1%) while 18.0% received anti BCMA products. CRS grade 0,1 occurred in 79.5% of patients (n=62) and 79.2% of patients were hospitalized within 30 days after CAR-T therapy (Median day of admission post CAR-T=5.5). Of patients who were hospitalized 26% had grades 2-4 CRS. Complete remission was achieved in 54.7% of patients. We compared the hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients across multiple characteristics, there was no association or predictors of hospitalization found. Albumin was the only predictor for CR. Conclusions: Our study provides data for safety and feasibility of outpatient CAR-T therapy despite potential risks for hospitalization. There are no clear predictors for hospitalizations after CAR-T therapy except for the development of CRS and ICAN. Higher baseline (pre-CAR-T) serum Albumin level was associated with higher odds of achieving CR.">

        <tr id="TPS7085 Background: Autologous (auto) CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy can induce long-term remissions for pts with R/R LBCL but approximately 60% will experience disease progression resulting in poor outcomes (Neelapu, 2023; Zurko, 2023). CRG-022 is a novel CAR T-cell product targeting CD22, a common B-cell antigen widely expressed in LBCL. Key features of CRG-022 include a fully human scFv derived from the m971 monoclonal antibody and 4-1BB/CD3z intracellular signaling domains (Singh, 2021). This CD22 CAR construct was developed at the National Cancer Institute and was investigated in phase (ph) 1 studies of pediatric/young adult pts with R/R CD22+ malignancies (Shah, 2020; NCT02315612) and at Stanford University in adults with R/R LBCL (Baird, 2021; NCT04088890) primarily in pts who received prior CD19-directed CAR-T therapy. The Stanford ph 1b study reported an overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rates of 66% and 52%, respectively in 29 pts treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 1x106 CAR+ T cells/kg (Frank, 2023). After a median follow-up of 27.3 months, the median overall survival had not been reached at the RP2D (Su, 2023). At the RP2D, no grade >3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), or immune effector cell associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome (IEC-HS) occurred; two pts (7%) developed grade 2 IEC-HS (Su, 2023; Srinagesh, 2023). Based on these notable results, this potentially pivotal ph 2 trial has been initiated. Methods: This Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety/efficacy of CRG-022 at 1x106 CAR+ T cells/kg in pts with R/R LBCL whose disease has progressed after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. The primary endpoint is ORR according to Lugano response criteria (Cheson, 2014) by blinded independent review. Adverse events (AEs) are graded per CTCAE v5 except with CRS, ICANS, and IEC-HS graded per ASTCT guidelines. Pts with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL transformed from follicular or marginal zone lymphoma, follicular large B-cell lymphoma (FLBL)/FL Grade 3B, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma are eligible. Other eligibility criteria include adequate hematologic and organ function, and no prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. Pts with prior treatment to both a CD19-directed auto CAR-T and a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody are also eligible within a separate cohort. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day for 3 days will be administered ahead of a single infusion of CRG-022. The study is designed to enroll approximately 123 pts. Study enrollment commenced in the US in August 2023, with 9 pt infused as of 08 JAN 2024. Clinical trial information: NCT05972720 .">

        <tr id="Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for various hematological, immunological and metabolic diseases, replacing the patient’s hematopoietic system with donor-derived healthy hematopoietic stem cells. HSCT can be complicated by early and late events related to impaired immunological recovery such as prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia post-HSCT. We present a 16-year-old female patient with sickle-cell disease who underwent HSCT with stem cells from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-II mismatched family donor. While cellular recovery was good post-HSCT, the patient developed mixed chimerism and suffered from cervical lymphadenopathy, recurrent airway infections and cutaneous SLE. She presented with hypogammaglobulinemia and was started on immunoglobulin substitution therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis. B-cell phenotyping showed that she had increased transitional and naïve mature B cells, reduced memory B cells, and diminished marginal zone/natural effector cells. In-depth immunophenotyping and B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing ruled out an intrinsic B-cell defect by expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), presence of somatic hypermutations and differentiation into IgG- and IgA-producing plasma cells in vitro. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry of lymph node tissue showed a clear block in terminal B-cell differentiation. Chimerism analysis of sorted lymph node populations showed that exclusively patient-derived B cells populated germinal centers, while only a minor fraction of follicular helper T cells was patient-derived. Given this discrepancy, we deduced that the HLA class-II disparity between patient and donor likely hinders terminal B-cell differentiation in the lymph node. This case highlights that studying disturbed cognate T-B interactions in the secondary lymphoid organs can provide unique insights when deciphering prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia post-HSCT.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are plasma cell dyscrasias characterized by monoclonal proliferation of pathological plasma cells with uncontrolled production of immunoglobulins. Autoimmune pathologies are conditions in which T and B lymphocytes develop a tendency to activate towards self-antigens in the absence of exogenous triggers. The aim of our review is to show the possible correlations between the two pathological aspects. Molecular studies have shown how different cytokines that either cause inflammation or control the immune system play a part in the growth of immunotolerance conditions that make it easier for the development of neoplastic malignancies. Uncontrolled immune activation resulting in chronic inflammation is also known to be at the basis of the evolution toward neoplastic pathologies, as well as multiple myeloma. Another point is the impact that myeloma-specific therapies have on the course of concomitant autoimmune diseases. Indeed, cases have been observed of patients suffering from multiple myeloma treated with daratumumab and bortezomib who also benefited from their autoimmune condition or patients under treatment with immunomodulators in which there has been an arising or worsening of autoimmunity conditions. The role of bone marrow transplantation in the course of concomitant autoimmune diseases remains under analysis.">

        <tr id="9534 Background: γ9δ2 T-cell tumor infiltration is associated with a favorable prognosis making these cells a new potential target for immunotherapy. The anti-BTN3A mAb ICT01 selectively activates γ9δ2 T cells and is being studied in the phase1/2a EVICTION Trial (NCT04243499). In preclinical studies, ICT01 induces upregulation of PD-1 on γ9δ2 T-cells and combination with pembrolizumab leads to enhanced cancer cell killing, providing scientific rationale to evaluate this combination. Here we present interim results from EVICTION of ICT01 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) refractory melanoma. Methods: EVICTION evaluated ICT01 (20 µg to 200 mg, Q3W) plus pembrolizumab (200mg IV Q3W) in a dose escalation solid tumor basket design that resulted in an ongoing expansion cohort of patients with CPI refractory melanoma (2 dose levels, 7 and 200 mg ICT01). Patients are selected based on higher baseline γ9δ2 T cells. Efficacy evaluations by i/RECIST 1.1 are conducted every 8 weeks. Disease Control Rate (DCR) as primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the sum of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD, minimum week 16). Baseline and on-treatment blood and biopsy specimens are collected for correlative translational work. Results: ICT01 plus pembrolizumab has a favorable safety profile with first-dose Grade 1/2 infusion related reactions (IRR) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as most common adverse events (in 38% and 19% of patients respectively, 5%and 2% Grade 3) among all doses and indications. To date, 35 CPI refractory melanoma patients have been enrolled, of which 65% have received 2+ prior lines of CPI. Currently 21 patients are evaluable at week 16 with a DCR of 42% (including 3 PR) and a 6-month progression free survival of 38%. In the circulation, full BTN3A receptor occupancy on immune cells was achieved at 7 mg dose, with down-modulation of BTN3A observed at doses greater than 20 mg. Clinical response was related to baseline tumoral BTN3A expression, sustained elevation of IFNg levels, and tumor microenvironment remodeling, including increased PD-L1 expression and CD8 T cells proliferation and activation. Conclusions: ICT01 in combination with pembrolizumab has a favorable safety profile and promising efficacy data. Patient selection based on BTN3A tumor expression will be further evaluated as an enrichment strategy. Clinical trial information: NCT04243499 .">

        <tr id="e14694 Background: PM1022 is an anti-PD-L1 × TIGIT bispecific antibody that is engineered with a fully human IgG targeting TIGIT in an IgG1 wild type Fc backbone, fused to a VHH at the c-terminus targeting PD-L1. The potential MOA includes releasing T cell inhibition by blocking both the PD-L1/PD-1 and CD155/CD112/TIGIT pathways, as well as depleting Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment and engaging FcγRs to activate myeloid cells. PM1022 showed robust in vitro and in vivo efficacy in preclinical studies, and this is the first in human study. Methods: This phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study consists of a standard 3+3 dose escalation and dose expansion part. PM1022 was administered intravenously as monotherapy on Day 1 of 21-day cycle. The primary objectives were to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in patients with advanced solid tumors. Results: As of January 28, 2024, a total of 15 patients in dose escalation part have received at least 1 dose of PM1022, with 3 patients in each of the 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 mg dose levels respectively. No DLT was observed up to 1200 mg. Of the 15 patients, TRAEs occurred in 8 patients (53.3%), ≥ Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 1 patient with platelet count decreased. No patients were discontinued from PM1022 due to TRAE. The most common TRAEs were rash (20%) and aspartate transaminase increased (20%). 14 patients completed at least one tumor evaluation. The median duration of PM1022 exposure was 6.1 weeks (range, 5.0-48.0 weeks). The ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 7.1% with a DCR of 35.7%. Preliminary antitumor activity has been observed in 1 patient with NSCLC (1200 mg, still on treatment) with previous PD-L1 TPS 100% who was enrolled after previous 3 lines therapy, including chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 treatment, and had a partial response in target lesion with 56.8% reduction. Another patient with esophageal cancer had been on PM1022 for total of 48 weeks until initiation of new anti-cancer therapy. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional with a terminal half-life of 7-13 days across the dose range of 100-1200 mg. Conclusions: PM1022 was safe and well-tolerated up to 1200 mg Q3W with preliminary anti-tumor activity. These findings could support further exploration of PM1022 in advanced solid tumors.

 Despite the Indolent lymphoma is a slowly growing tumor that has many therapeutic options and good initial response, it is usually incurable. Relapses and HT to aggressive form may occur and some patients die from their disease. For the RR iNHL Several novel targeted therapies may be recommended such as antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) and bispecific T cell engagers (BiTE). B cell maturation antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein that regulate B cell proliferation, survival, maturation and differentiation into PCs. IT is expressed in multiple myeloma and B cell neoplasms. The effects of BCMA have been studied in multiple myeloma and a new BCMA-targeted immunotherapy has been approved for the treatment RRMM patients. Few studies done to detect BCMA in other Hematologic malignancies as a diagnostic or prognostic tool and a therapeutic potential of antiBCMa targeted therapy in these malignancies. In this study we detect sBCMA in the serum of iNHL patients.



 To measure the levels soluble BCMA (sBCMA) in the serum of adult patients with indolent non Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).



 A case control study conducted on adult patients of iNHL attending hematology department of Ain Shams university with a participant of 40 cases of newly diagnosed and RR iNHL plus 40 control.



 In the present study we found that there was no statistically significant difference between the studied groups as regard sex, TLC, Hb, platelet counts and tumor subtypes in relation to BCMA level . While there is a statistically significant correlation between Age, stage and LDH to the BCMA level. The results suggest that the BCMA level is significantly higher in patients with iNHL than the healthy controls.



 This study suggest that the BCMA level is significantly higher in patients with iNHL than the healthy controls. By increasing the Age ≥ 40 years the risk of iNHL is increased by 1.71 folds than otherwise healthy controls. The BCMA level was positively correlated to LDH implying that BCMA could be related to iNHL proliferation rate and possibly lymphoma aggressiveness. The level of BCMA more than 430 ng/dL correlated with a more than a 4.5-fold rise in the risk of higher disease stage with borderline significance. Further studies are needed to detect the relation between The BCMA level and the disease prognosis that may be useful for a promising AntiBCMA targeted therapy for RR patients.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is characterized by autoantibodies targeting keratinocytes adhesion proteins desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and 3, and by the HLA-DRB1-0402 predisposition allele. Treatment using rituximab (RTX) combined with short-term corticosteroids (CS) allows disease control and long-lasting remission.


OBJECTIVE
The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of RTX on the circulating subpopulations of Dsg-3-specific T lymphocytes that specifically regulate B cell responses: follicular helper (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T (Tfr) lymphocytes.


METHODS
Using the HLA-DRB1-0402 tetramer loaded with the Dsg-3 immunodominant peptide, we analysed by flow cytometry the frequency, the polarisation and the activation status of blood Dsg-3-specific follicular T cell populations at baseline, Month 6 and long-term follow-up (Month 60-90) from PV patients.


RESULTS
At baseline, we observed a predominance of Tfh1* and Tfh17 subsets and an underrepresentation of the Tfh2 subset among autoreactive Dsg-3-specific Tfh cells as compared with non-autoreactive Tfh cells. RTX treatment induced a decrease of autoreactive Tfh cells with no effect on their polarisation during patients' follow-up. In parallel, we observed the emergence of a Dsg-3-specific Tfr subpopulation with a significant overexpression of the surface activation markers PD1, ICOS, and CD25 that was not observed at the surface of autoreactive Tfh and non-autoreactive Tfr cells of the same PV patients. In contrast, a very few Dsg-3 specific Tfr cells were observed in PV patients treated with CS alone.


CONCLUSION
Here we show that the emergence of circulating autoreactive Dsg-3-specific Tfr cells is associated with the long-term efficacy of RTX in PV patients.">

        <tr id="6552 Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (alloHSCT) offer a potential curative treatment for many hematological cancers, however, traditional alloHSCT is associated with high mortality from complications including infection, graft versus host disease (GvHD) and relapse. Orca-T is an investigational allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy that includes stem and immune cells, derived from allogeneic donors, that leverages highly purified, polyclonal donor regulatory T cells to control alloreactive immune responses. In this sub-group analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were treated with Orca-T. Methods: Data from 37 patients with the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR/CRi who received myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa (BFT) followed by Orca-T by 6/30/22 as part of a multicenter phase 1b single-arm trial (NCT04013685) are reported here. Patients enrolled in the phase 1b trial who did not meet these criteria were not included in this analysis. Patients received BFT prior to Orca-T, followed by single-agent GvHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus, and had an 8/8 related or unrelated matched donor. Donors were matched via DNA-based high-resolution typing of HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Results: Orca-T was successfully manufactured at a centralized GMP facility, distributed, and infused at study sites throughout the U.S. Vein-to-vein time (i.e. time between end of donor apheresis to start of recipient’s Orca-T infusion) was < 72 hours for all patients, with the majority < 60 hours. Median age was 51 years, 49% were female and 16% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Twenty-three (62%) had matched related donors and 14 (38%) had matched unrelated donors. Baseline HCT-CI score was 3 and 4 in 27% and 8% of the patients, respectively. The majority had intermediate DRI scores (89%) and 41% were MRD positive at baseline. The median duration of follow-up was 14 months. Relapse-free survival at 12 months was 81.4% (95% CI: 62.9, 91.2). Non-relapse mortality and overall survival were 0% and 100% at 12 months, respectively. Conclusions: These encouraging results suggest that investigational Orca-T could represent a reduced toxicity alternative to conventional alloHSCT. This combination of Orca-T with myeloablative BFT led to > 80% RFS without treatment related mortality, and 100% overall survival in this AML patient population. These outcomes were accomplished with consistent and reliable cell manufacturing and distribution of Orca-T at a national scale. A multi-center randomized controlled phase 3 trial comparing Orca-T to SOC, utilizing BFT or TBI-based conditioning, will complete enrollment during the first half of 2024. (NCT05316701).

        <tr id="Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents a well-established biomarker of PCa and its levels correlate positively with the disease progression, culminating at the stage of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Due to its tissue-specific expression and cell surface localization, PSMA shows superior potential for precise imaging and therapy of PCa. Antibody-based immunotherapy targeting PSMA offers the promise of selectively engaging the host immune system with minimal off-target effects. Here we report on the design, expression, purification, and characterization of a bispecific engager, termed 5D3-CP33, that efficiently recruits macrophages to the vicinity of PSMA-positive cancer cells mediating PCa death. The engager was engineered by fusing the anti-PSMA 5D3 antibody fragment to a cyclic peptide 33 (CP33) selectively binding the Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI/CD64) on the surface of phagocytes. Functional parts of 5D3-CP33 engager revealed nanomolar affinity for PSMA and FcγRI/CD64 with dissociation constants of KD = 3 nM and KD = 140 nM, respectively. At a concentration as low as 0.3 nM, the engager was found to trigger production of reactive oxygen species by U937 monocytic cells in the presence of PSMA-positive cells. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis of PSMA-positive cancer cells by U937 monocytes when exposed to 0.1 nM 5D3-CP33. Our findings illustrate that 5D3-CP33 effectively and specifically activates monocytes upon PSMA-positive target engagement, resulting in the elimination of tumor cells. The 5D3-CP33 engager can thus serve as a promising lead for the development of new immunotherapy tools for the efficient treatment of PCa.">

        <tr id="T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a rare histologic variant of LBCL. Limited data regarding CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) THRLBCL suggest poor efficacy. We investigated CART outcomes for R/R THRLBCL through the CIBMTR registry. A total of 58 adult patients with R/R THRLBCL who received commercial CD19-CART between 2018-2022 were identified. Most patients (67%) had early relapse of disease (45% primary refractory) with a median of 3 (range: 1-7) prior therapies and were treated with Axicabtagene ciloleucel (69%). At median follow-up of 23 months post-CART, 2-year overall and progression-free survival were 42% (95% CI: 27-57) and 29% (95% CI: 17-43), respectively. In univariable analysis, poor performance status pre-CART was associated with higher mortality (HR 2.35, 95%CI 1.02-5.5). The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse/progression and non-relapse mortality were 69% and 2%, respectively. Grade ≥3 CRS and ICANS occurred in 7% and 15% of patients, respectively. In this largest analysis of CD19-CART for R/R THRLBCL, approximately 30% of patients were alive and progression-free 2 years post-CART. Despite a high incidence of progression (69% at 2 years), these results suggest a subset of patients with R/R THRLBCL may have durable responses with CART.">

        <tr id="Despite continuous improvements in the management and treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), approximately 35% of the patients experience relapse or are refractory to frontline chemotherapy. For these patients, outcomes are far from satisfactory, and a real unmet need exists to both improve frontline treatment and create better options for relapsed/refractory disease. Polatuzumab vedotin is an anti-CD79b antibody conjugated to the monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) microtubule inhibitor. The molecule has recently been under the spotlights for the promising results of the frontline combination with rituximab cyclophosphamide doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHP) in the phase III POLARIX study, demonstrating improved progression-free survival over standard R-CHOP. A remarkable improvement in terms of complete response rate and overall survival with polatuzumab vedotin has also been achieved by combining polatuzumab with rituximab and bendamustine (pola-BR) over the standard BR for relapsed/refractory patients. Based on the results of these studies, health authorities in several countries granted approval for polatuzumab vedotin both for patients with previously untreated and for relapsed/refractory DLBCL. In this review, we summarize the data of major studies recently concluded with polatuzumab vedotin, and we provide an overview of the ongoing combination trials for frontline and relapsed/refractory DLBCL, outlining reported toxicities.">

        <tr id="e19007 Background: Extranodal bulky lesions, a significant adverse prognostic factor in lymphoma, commonly denote a more aggressive disease course, mandating prompt and intensified treatment strategies. In response, we developed ThisCART19A, a non-genetic editing and off-the-shelf anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy incorporating intracellular retention of membrane proteins, representing a novel approach that downregulates surface expression of TCRαβ/CD3 complexes. ThisCART19 has exhibited a favorable safety profile and promising efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory bulky B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated trial employing an open-label, dose escalation, and expansion design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ThisCART19A in patients with relapsed or refractory bulky B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Bulky disease was defined as the longest diameter of the mass >5 cm at baseline. Results: Between June, 2021, and June, 2023, 13 extranodal bulky disease were enrolled in the studies and successfully received ThisCART19A. The median age was 56 (range, 37~67) years. All 13 patients had 3 median prior lines of therapy (range, 2-5). All patients received anti-CD20 and multi- agent chemotherapy. 8 (61.54%) patients had prior auto CART. mSPD was 48 (range, 16~162) cm². mTMTV was 114.9 (range, 14~483) ml. As of February 2024, The most common adverse events were CRS (100%) , infections (30.77%), ICANS (23.08%) and cytopenias(100%); This is no grade 3 or higher CRS occurred;only 1(7.69%)patient experienced grade 4 ICANS and relieved after intravenous dexamethasone treatment. This is no treatment-related deaths occurred. Among the 13 patients, 10 were evaluable, with an ORR and CR of 90% and 80%, respectively, at 28 days post-infusion. mPFS was 62 days (range, 28~227). The patient who achieved a PR received chemotherapy and radiotherapy as consolidation, As of February 5th, 2024, the patient has survived for 263 days and is still under follow-up. Additionally, two patients progressed after CR received sequential chemotherapy and BCL-2 Inhibitor, with an average OS of 326.5 days, still being under follow-up. In 13 evaluable patients, the mean C-max was 1043.13 cells/μL(range, 0.59~10045.4), and the mean AUC0-28d was 1542.23 cells/μL × day(range, 0.91~11724).In this cohort, two patients received low-dose infusions at 1×106 cells/kg and still achieved excellent expansion, the respective C-max were 726.432 cells/μL and 336.67 cells/μL. Conclusions: This CART19A exhibited favorable safety, remarkable expansion potential, and efficacy profiles in the treatment of r/r bulky lymphoma. Notably, it achieved a high ORR of 90%, providing a favorable window of opportunity for subsequent consolidation and intensification treatments. Moreover, this transition from a bulky to a non-bulky disease state reduces the intricacy of follow-up treatments. Clinical trial information: NCT04384393 .">

        <tr id="e19059 Background: Loncastuximab tesirine-lpy (Lonca) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an anti-CD19 antibody conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer cytotoxin. Epcoritamab-bysp (Epco) is a CD20×CD3 T cell-engaging bispecific antibody (bsAb) that redirects T-cells to eliminate malignant B-cells. Epco and Lonca target different B-cell surface antigens and combining both is expected to have additive or synergistic efficacy. Previously, a novel QSP model for Lonca was developed (Utsey K et al. Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2023;12:123-125) and validated with clinical data from patients with R/R DLBCL (Caimi P et al. Blood. 2022;140:9548-9550). A combination QSP model for Lonca with Epco in R/R DLBCL was described to predict potential anti-tumor synergies in proposed clinical trials. Methods: The model reduced previous Lonca model complexity while maintaining core functionality and was combined with a published QSP model for T-cell bsAbs (Hosseini I et al. Npj Syst Bio Appl. 2020;6(1):1-11) to predict tumor dynamics after Lonca and/or Epco treatment. Assumptions included: 1) Lonca or Epco induce healthy and malignant B-cell killing; 2) tumor comprises malignant B- & T-cells; 3) tumor volume is based on malignant B-cell count; 4) T-cells can enter or leave tumor as with other tissues; 5) CD19-/low CD20+ B-cells account for tumor heterogeneity from cells insensitive to Lonca treatment. Results: Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was predicted to plateau by Cycle (C) 2 with Epco monotherapy. By end of C3, however, predicted median normalized tumor volume reduction with co-dosing Lonca and Epco was approximately 1 log order greater than Epco alone. Maximum activity of Lonca and Epco therapy was not observed until C4 or later as depth of tumor regression increased with additional treatment cycles. Since patients with DLBCL may present with low T-cell counts (Hutchings et al. Lancet. 2021) the effect of T-cell count at baseline was evaluated. A 50% decrease at baseline from 2000-1000 T-cells/µL significantly reduced antitumor effect with Epco alone but made no difference with Lonca in combination. Conclusions: These results resemble predictions for Lonca in combination with other bsAbs (Lonca plus mosunetuzumab or glofitamab; abstract submitted to AACR 2024). By end of C3, Lonca plus Epco was predicted to promote substantially more TGI than Epco or Lonca alone. While increased doses of Lonca from 90-150 µg/kg in combination had limited additional therapeutic benefit, combination treatment beyond C3 was predicted to increase depth of tumor regression. Response from Lonca and Epco co-dosing was predicted to be less affected by suppressed T-cell counts at baseline compared to Epco alone; a feature that may enhance responsiveness when T-cell level is moderate.">

        <tr id="CD70 is an attractive target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of both solid and liquid malignancies. However, the functionality of CD70-specific CAR T cells is modest. We optimized a CD70-specific VHH-based CAR (nanoCAR). We evaluated the nanoCARs in clinically relevant models in vitro, using co-cultures of CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells with malignant rhabdoid tumor organoids, and in vivo, using a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Whereas the nanoCAR T cells were highly efficient in organoid co-cultures, they showed only modest efficacy in the PDX model. We determined that fratricide was not causing this loss in efficacy, rather CD70 interaction in cis with the nanoCAR induced exhaustion. Knocking out CD70 in nanoCAR T cells using CRISPR/Cas9, resulted in dramatically enhanced functionality in the DLBCL PDX model. Through single-cell transcriptomics, we obtained evidence that CD70 knock out (KO) CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells were protected from antigen-induced exhaustion. In addition, we demonstrated that WT CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells already exhibited signs of exhaustion shortly after production. Their gene signature strongly overlapped with gene signatures of exhausted CAR T cells. On the other hand, the gene signature of KO CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells overlapped with the gene signature of CAR T-cell infusion products that led to complete responses in chronic lymphatic leukemia patients. Our data show that CARs targeting endogenous T-cell antigens negatively affect CAR T-cell functionality by inducing an exhausted state, which can be overcome by knocking out the specific target.">

        <tr id="TPS2669 Background: Bispecific T-cell engagers represent a promising therapeutic approach for patients with solid tumors; however, these agents require an appropriate target antigen. B7-H6 is an encouraging target as it is expressed on multiple solid tumors but shows only limited expression on normal tissue (1). BI 765049 is a novel immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like T-cell engager designed to simultaneously bind B7-H6-expressing tumor cells and CD3 on T-cells resulting in the formation of a cytolytic synapse that triggers apoptosis of the tumor cells. Methods: NCT06091930 is a Phase I, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion trial that aims to assess the safety and tolerability of BI 765049 alone or in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor ezabenlimab, in patients with advanced or unresectable gastric cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or non-small cell lung cancer. Patients must have progressed on, or be ineligible for, standard therapies. Key inclusion criteria include confirmed B7-H6 expression (central pathology review) except in CRC; ≥1 evaluable target lesion outside of the central nervous system (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.1); and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1. Patients with prior B7-H6-targeted treatment are ineligible. The study is divided into four parts: dose escalation and expansion of BI 765049 monotherapy (Parts I and II, respectively), and in combination with ezabenlimab (Parts III and IV, respectively). BI 765049 dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Treatment will continue until progressive disease or discontinuation for other reasons, or for up to 36 months. The primary endpoint for Parts I and III is the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities; and for Parts II and IV it is objective response (OR; determined by the investigator; RECIST v1.1). The secondary endpoints for Parts I and III are pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and OR (RECIST v1.1); and for Parts II and IV secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control, PK measurements, and OR (immunotherapy RECIST [iRECIST]). 1.

        <tr id="e14535 Background: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most common complication of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) for hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that patients undergoing CAR-T therapy who are on metformin will experience a lower incidence or severity of CRS than patients not on this medication. Methods: We evaluated all patients treated with CAR-T at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1/1/2018 and 1/31/2023, and abstracted relevant clinical and laboratory characteristics to determine the incidence and severity of CRS, PFS as well as OS in patients who were, or were not, on metformin before and during CAR-T therapy for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. We used the Chi-Square test, Mann-Whitney test and the Kaplan-Meier method to analyze data. Results: In the 5-year interval under consideration 237 patients received CAR-T, 168 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 69 for multiple myeloma (MM). 23 patients (15 NHL and 8 MM) were on metformin at the time of CAR-T. 15 patient developed CRS while on metformin and 175 patients not on metformin (p=0.05). Grade 3 or 4 CRS incidence was 4% in both groups (p=0.41). Of the 153 patients with NHL not on metformin, 121 developed any grade of CRS, while 10 of 15 patients on metformin developed CRS (p=0.268). 4 NHL patients developed CRS Grade ≥3 or higher, while 0 of 15 on metformin developed Grade ≥3 CRS (p=0.237). For the MM patients, the incidence of CRS was 49 patients not on metformin and 5 patients on metformin (p<0.001). 3 MM patients developed CRS Grade ≥3 or higher, while 0 of 8 on metformin developed Grade ≥3 CRS (p=0.346). 12 of 15 patients on metformin with NHL achieved CR compared to 92 of 153 patients not on metformin (p=0.1305). 3 of 8 patients with MM on metformin compared to 24 of 61 patients with MM not on metformin achieved CR or better post CAR-T (p=0.92). Tocilizumab was used in 40% of patients on metformin but in 66% of patients not on metformin (p=0.0016). In NHL patients, PFS from CAR-T infusion was not reached (range: 6.3 to NR) for patients on metformin versus 9.9 months (range: 6.3–19.5) in patients not on metformin (p = 0.3332). In the MM patients, progression-free survival (PFS) from CAR-T infusion was 8.4 months (95% CI: 7.9–not reached [NR]) for patients on metformin and 22.6 months (13.7–NR) for those not on metformin (p = 0.07). Median OS for NHL patients on metformin was not reached (9.766–NR) versus 32.6 months (18.6–NR) for patients not on metformin (p = 0.7022). Median OS was 17 months (95% CI: 8.3 to NR) for patients with MM on metformin vs NR (95% CI: 9.4 to NR) for patients not on metformin (p = 0.2559). Conclusions: In this retrospective study, the co-administration of metformin during CAR-T cell therapy for NHL and MM appears to be associated with a numerically reduced incidence of CRS. The effect appears to be particularly marked in patients with multiple myeloma. Metformin therapy did not seem to affect the response to CAR-T therapy in either NHL or MM.">

        <tr id="e14678 Background: ZGGS15 is a recombinant humanized bispecific antibody composed of a monoclonal antibody against LAG-3 and TIGIT. It can specifically bind LAG-3 and TIGIT. It reverses LAG-3 and TIGIT immune suppression to T and NK cells, relieves suppression of Treg to T and NK cells, promotes the activation and proliferation of T and NK cells, and cytokines release. ZGGS15 restores T and NK cell functions to kill tumor cells. In non-clinical studies, we found that ZGGS15 had significant anti-tumor effects and synergistic anti-tumor effects with Anti-PD-1 antibody. Therefore, we conducted a Phase 1 clinical study to assess the tolerability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of this drug as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods: During the dose escalation stage, an accelerated titration design (ATD) in the first dose (1 subject if ≤Grade 2 treatment-related adverse event occurred) and the standard "3+3" design in the rest doses were used. Subjects were patients with advanced solid tumors who failed to the available standard treatments. The dose groups were set from 0.3 to 30 (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20, 30) mg/kg, intravenous infusion, once every 3 weeks. The first 21-day period was defined as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period. Subjects could continue to receive ZGGS15 until treatment discontinuation criteria were met. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST1.1 and iRECIST. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and receptor occupancy (RO) profiles were also assessed in this study. Results: A total of 12 patients (4 males and 8 females) completed the DLT observation in the first four dose groups (0.3 to 10 mg), with a median age of 57 years. Eight (66.7%) of them received at least 3 lines of antineoplastic therapies, and five (41.7%) have been exposed to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. There was no DLT event observed. Thirty-eight treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred. Up to now, TRAEs were all grade 1 ~ 2. The most frequent TRAEs were proteinuria (33.3%, 4/12), hypokalemia (25%, 3/12), hypoalbuminemia (25%, 3/12), and hypertriglyceridemia (25%, 3/12). The Cmax and AUC increased from 0.3-1 mg/kg approximately in dose proportion. Nearly complete and sustained RO of T and NK cells in PBMCs was observed at 1 mg/kg dose of ZGGS15 for at least 3 weeks. Conclusions: The first four dose levels of ZGGS15 were very well tolerated. A good PK profile, and a long-lasting RO were observed in this escalation study. It is anticipated that this product could provide an additional benefit only when use in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Clinical trial information: NCT05864573 .">

        <tr id="Th9 cells, a subset of T-helper cells producing interleukin-9 (IL-9), play a vital role in the adaptive immune response and have diverse effects in different diseases. Regulated by transcription factors like PU.1 and IRF4, and cytokines such as IL-4 and TGF-β, Th9 cells drive tissue inflammation. This review focuses on their emerging role in immunopathophysiology. Th9 cells exhibit immune-mediated cancer cell destruction, showing promise in glioma and cervical cancer treatment. However, their role in breast and lung cancer is intricate, requiring a deeper understanding of pro- and anti-tumor aspects. Th9 cells, along with IL-9, foster T cell and immune cell proliferation, contributing to autoimmune disorders. They are implicated in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and infections. In allergic reactions and asthma, Th9 cells fuel pro-inflammatory responses. Targeting Foxo1 may regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, alleviating disease symptoms. This comprehensive review outlines Th9 cells' evolving immunopathophysiological role, emphasizing the necessity for further research to grasp their effects and potential therapeutic applications across diseases.">

        <tr id="Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder distinguished from multiple myeloma (MM) by the degree of organ involvement due to tissue deposition of misfolded proteins. Treatments for AL amyloidosis have largely been borrowed from those developed for patients with MM. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has historically been associated with the best outcomes. The recent incorporation of daratumumab into up front therapy represents a significant advance and has changed the treatment paradigm, calling into question the role of ASCT. The development of very active novel immune and cellular therapies, specifically B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed therapies, has similarly been transformative for patients with MM and is now being studied in patients with AL amyloidosis. These include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, bispecific antibodies, and antibody drug conjugates. Although limited, preliminary data in patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis are showing promising results, and it is expected that the treatment landscape for AL amyloidosis will continue to evolve. Particular attention to safety, potential for organ recovery, and quality of life will be important when evaluating new treatments and/or treatment paradigms.">

        <tr id="TPS6585 Background: Despite improved outcomes with azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax (VEN) in newly diagnosed (ND) unfit acute myeloid leukemia (AML), only a subset of patients (pts) respond (CR 37%; CR/CRi 66%) and long-term survival remains inadequate (mOS <15m, DiNardo NEJM 2020). The measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative rate was 41% in AZA-VEN treated pts in VIALE-A which was associated with improved survival (Pratz JCO 2022). CD123 is expressed on the majority of AML blasts and leukemic stem cells while minimally expressed on normal hematopoietic stem cells (Kovtun Blood Adv 2018). Pivekimab sunirine (PVEK, IMGN632) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising a high-affinity CD123 antibody, cleavable linker, and an indolinobenzodiazepine pseudodimer (IGN) payload. The IGN payload alkylates DNA and causes single strand breaks without crosslinking. IGNs are designed to have high potency against tumor cells, while demonstrating less toxicity to normal marrow progenitors than other DNA-targeting payloads. Clinical data from the first 50 pts in the dose expansion cohorts 1 and 2 with ND AML demonstrated a 76% (22/29) MRD negativity rate (by flow cytometry, negativity threshold <0.1%) (Daver ASH 2023), supporting the continued enrollment of the PVEK+AZA+VEN triplet and further evaluation of the regimen’s antileukemia activity and safety in consideration of potential registration-enabling trials. Methods: This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b/2 study of PVEK administered in a combination with AZA+VEN in pts with ND CD123-positive (CD123+ by flow cytometry or IHC) AML, with no prior treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA). Pts will receive the recommended phase 2 dose of PVEK 0.045 mg/kg IV as a < 30-minute outpatient infusion on day 7, AZA 75 mg/m2 SC or IV daily on days 1 to 7, and VEN 400 mg PO daily for up to 28 days in a 28-day cycle. During cycle 1, a bone marrow evaluation at or around day 21 is required to inform VEN dose duration. Current eligibility criteria for continued enrollment of AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy include age ≥ 75 years old, or age < 75 years old with ECOG 2-3, or at least one defined comorbidity. The primary study objectives are to assess antileukemia clinical activity (composite CR [complete remission] rate, overall response rate, duration of remission) and MRD-negativity rates. Key secondary objectives are safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. The PVEK+AZA+VEN triplet in pts with ND unfit AML is currently enrolling across sites in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and USA. Clinical trial information: NCT04086264 .">

        <tr id="We present the preclinical pharmacology of BNT142, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)–formulated RNA (RNA-LNP) encoding a T cell–engaging bispecific antibody that monovalently binds the T cell marker CD3 and bivalently binds claudin 6 (CLDN6), an oncofetal antigen that is absent from normal adult tissue but expressed on various solid tumors. Upon BNT142 RNA-LNP delivery in cell culture, mice, and cynomolgus monkeys, RNA is translated, followed by self-assembly into and secretion of the functional bispecific antibody RiboMab02.1. In vitro, RiboMab02.1 mediated CLDN6 target cell–specific activation and proliferation of T cells, and potent target cell killing. In mice and cynomolgus monkeys, intravenously administered BNT142 RNA-LNP maintained therapeutic serum concentrations of the encoded antibody. Concentrations of RNA-encoded RiboMab02.1 were maintained longer in circulation in mice than concentrations of directly injected, sequence-identical protein. Weekly injections of mice with BNT142 RNA-LNP in the 0.1- to 1-μg dose range were sufficient to eliminate CLDN6-positive subcutaneous human xenograft tumors and increase survival over controls. Tumor regression was associated with an influx of T cells and depletion of CLDN6-positive cells. BNT142 induced only transient and low cytokine production in CLDN6-positive tumor-bearing mice humanized with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). No signs of adverse effects from BNT142 RNA-LNP administration were observed in mice or cynomolgus monkeys. On the basis of these and other findings, a phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial has been initiated to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of BNT142 RNA-LNP in patients with CLDN6-positive advanced solid tumors (NCT05262530). The anti-CLDN6 T cell engager RiboMab02.1 encoded by BNT142 RNA-LNP shows favorable preclinical pharmacology against CLDN6-positive solid tumors. Editor’s summary Bispecific T cell–engaging antibodies (BsAbs) have been approved to treat hematological malignancies; however, current forms are limited because of manufacturing and short serum half-lives. To improve these BsAbs, Stadler et al. have created BNT142, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)–formulated RNA encoding a BsAb against CD3 and the oncofetal antigen claudin 6 (CLDN6). The authors then showed inhibition of tumor growth in treated preclinical mouse models and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and no adverse effects in cynomolgus monkeys. This has led to initiation of a phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial, which will be used to assess safety and efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT05262530). —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="Recent years have seen a marked increase in research on chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, with specific relevance to the treatment of hematological malignancies. Here, the structural principles, iterative processes, and target selection of CAR-T cells for therapeutic applications are described in detail, as well as the challenges faced in the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. These challenges include insufficient infiltration of cells, off-target effects, cytokine release syndrome, and tumor lysis syndrome. In addition, directions in the iterative development of CAR-T cell therapy are discussed, including modifications of CAR-T cell structures, improvements in specificity using multi-targets and novel targets, the use of Boolean logic gates to minimize off-target effects and control toxicity, and the adoption of additional protection mechanisms to improve the durability of CAR-T cell treatment.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND Predicting immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) in patients infused with CAR T cells is still a conundrum. This complication, thought to be consequent to CAR T cell activation, arises a few days after infusion, when circulating CAR T cells are scarce and specific CAR T cell–derived biomarkers are lacking. METHODS CAR+ extracellular vesicle (CAR+EV) release was assessed in human CD19.CAR T cells cocultured with CD19+ target cells. A prospective cohort of 100 patients with B cell lymphoma infused with approved CD19.CAR T cell products was assessed for plasma CAR+EVs as biomarkers of in vivo CD19.CAR T cell activation. Human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived (iPSC-derived) neural cells were used as a model for CAR+EV-induced neurotoxicity. RESULTS In vitro release of CAR+EVs occurs within 1 hour after target engagement. Plasma CAR+EVs are detectable 1 hour after infusion. A concentration greater than 132.8 CAR+EVs/μL at hour +1 or greater than 224.5 CAR+EVs/μL at day +1 predicted ICANS in advance of 4 days, with a sensitivity and a specificity outperforming other ICANS predictors. ENO2+ nanoparticles were released by iPSC-derived neural cells upon CAR+EV exposure and were increased in plasma of patients with ICANS. CONCLUSION Plasma CAR+EVs are an immediate signal of CD19.CAR T cell activation, are suitable predictors of neurotoxicity, and may be involved in ICANS pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Hematological toxicity is a common side effect of CAR-T therapies, being particularly severe in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of 48 patients treated with BCMA CAR-T cells to characterize the kinetics of cytopenia, identify predictive factors and determine potential mechanism underlying these toxicities. The overall incidence of cytopenia was 95.74%, and grade>3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia one month after infusion was observed in 57% and 53% of the patients and was still present after 1 year in 4 and 3 patients respectively. Presence of cytopenia at baseline and high peak inflammatory markers highly correlated with cytopenia persisting up to three months. To determine potential mechanisms underpinning cytopenias, we evaluated the paracrine effect of BCMA CAR-T cells on the differentiation of HSPCs using an ex-vivo myeloid differentiation model. Phenotypic analysis showed that supernatants from activated CAR-T cells (spCAR) halted HSPCs differentiation promoting more immature phenotypes, with reduced expression of granulocytic, monocytic and erythroid markers. Single-cell RNAseq demonstrated an upregulation of transcription factors associated with early stages of hematopoietic differentiation in the presence of spCAR (GATA2, RUNX1 and CEBPA) and decreased activity of key regulons involved in neutrophil and monocytic maturation (ID2 and MAFB). Our results suggest that CAR-T cell activation negatively influences hematopoietic differentiation through paracrine effects inducing arrest of HSPCs maturation and contributes to the understanding of severe cytopenia observed after CAR-T cell treatment in MM patients. These results may identify regulatory mechanisms involved in alter hematopoiesis and could lead to alternative therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="2602 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibition of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has demonstrated durable clinical benefit in patients with advanced solid tumors. However, dose density is limited due to toxicity. BA3071 is a conditionally active biologic (CAB) anti–CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands CD80 and CD86 [1]. CABs are activated within the acidic tumor microenvironment. Conditional and reversible binding of BA3071 may reduce on- and off-tumor immune-related adverse events (AEs) and autoimmunity, avoid tissue-mediated drug deposition, and improve pharmacokinetics. We evaluated the safety and antitumor activity of BA3071 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods: Patients naïve to anti–CTLA-4 therapy with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of single-agent BA3071 every 3 weeks (Q3W) at cycle 1, followed by combination BA3071 + nivolumab from cycle 2 onward. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response assessment was performed Q6W with RECIST v1.1. Results: Eighteen patients were treated with BA3071 (7–700 mg) and nivolumab (240 mg); 61% had received ≥3 lines of prior systemic therapy, and all patients had experienced failure of anti–PD-1 therapy. Four patients experienced grade 3 related treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; hypertension, increased lipase, atrial fibrillation, gastritis, and diabetic ketoacidosis); no grade 4 related TEAEs were observed. Two patients experienced grade 3 immune-related TEAEs (diarrhea [BA3071 350 mg] and diabetic ketoacidosis [BA3071 700 mg]). Among 16 efficacy-evaluable patients, 9 experienced stable disease, and 2 out of 5 patients receiving BA3071 in the 350-mg cohort achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 responses (complete response in cervical carcinoma and partial response in gastroesophageal carcinoma). One patient with metastatic small cell lung cancer who received 7 mg BA3071 remained without progression for >1 year (69 weeks). Conclusions: Treatment with the novel, conditionally active anti–CTLA-4 agent BA3071, in combination with anti–PD-1 therapy (at doses higher than those currently approved for anti–CTLA-4/PD-1 therapy), yielded confirmed responses with a promising tolerability profile. Phase 1 dose escalation of BA3071 continues at 700 mg up to 1000 mg, and phase 2 monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts are currently enrolling at a starting dose level of 350 mg. 1.

        <tr id="Cancer encompasses various elements occurring at the cellular and genetic levels, necessitating an immunotherapy capable of efficiently addressing both aspects. T cells can combat cancer cells by specifically recognizing antigens on them. This innate capability of T cells has been used to develop cellular immunotherapies, but most of them can only target antigens through major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). New gene-editing techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-cas9) can precisely edit the DNA sequences. CRISPR-cas9 has made it possible to generate genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that can overcome the problems associated with old immunotherapies. In chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, the patient’s T cells are isolated and genetically modified to exhibit synthetic CAR(s). CAR-T cell treatment has shown remarkably positive clinical outcomes in cancers of various types. Nevertheless, there are various challenges that reduce CAR-T effectiveness in solid tumors. It is required to address these challenges in order to make CAR-T cell therapy a better and safer option. Combining CAR-T treatment with other immunotherapies that target multiple antigens has shown positive outcomes. Moreover, recently generated Boolean logic-gated advanced CARs along with artificial intelligence has expanded its potential to treat solid tumors in addition to blood cancers. This review aims to describe the structure, types, and various methods used to develop CAR-T cells. The clinical applications of CAR-T cells in hematological malignancies and solid tumours have been described in detail. In addition, this discussion has addressed the limitations associated with CAR-T cells, explored potential strategies to mitigate CAR-T-related toxicities, and delved into future perspectives.">

        <tr id="e19045 Background: CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has been demonstrated to be a valuable treatment option for relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). It has been shown that between 39% and 97% of clinical samples of B-NHL also express BCMA. To further improve safety and efficacy, we have developed GC012F, a CD19 and BCMA dual-targeting CAR-T, manufactured using the novel next-day FasT CAR-T process, for the treatment of r/r B-NHL. The data from an investigator-initiated trial of GC012F for r/r B-NHL were reported at ASCO 2023 (# 7562). Here, we present updated results of the trial, including more pts and a longer follow-up period. Methods: This is a single-arm, open label trial (ChiCTR2100047061). The patients (pts) were enrolled and treated with a single infusion of GC012F in escalating dosing cohorts after a standard lymphodepletion regimen. The primary objectives of this study were safety and tolerability; the secondary were pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded by ASBMT 2019, adverse effects were evaluated according to CTCAE 5.0. Efficacy assessment of GC012F was referred to the Lugano criteria. Results: As of data cut-off on January 30th, 2024, with a median of 410.5 days (range: 28 - 839) of follow-up, all pts received single GC012F infusions at dose levels ranging from 3.7×104 to 3×105 CAR-T/kg. The median age was 49.5 years (range: 18 - 67). Ten pts were Ann Arbor stage III/IV disease. All pts lymphoma samples expressed CD19, and 9 out of 11 expressed BCMA. Ptsreceived a median of 2 prior lines (range: 2 - 3) of therapy including rituximab and anthracyclines. Two ptsreceived the auto-HSCT previously. 91.7% (11/12) of the pts achieved ORR at month 3 post GC012F infusion; 66.7% (8/12) CR at month 6 and 60% (6/10) CR at month 12, respectively. To date, the longest duration of remission is 27.0 months. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One pt had grade 3 CRS and recovered within 2 days. No ICANS were observed. Grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities included lymphocytopenia (11/12), neutropenia (11/12) and leukopenia (10/12). All TEAEs were resolved after treatment with standard of care and supportive care. The median peak copy number of CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood was 70,083 copies/μg DNA (range: 6,876 - 185,039), and the median peak time was 14 days (range: 9 - 21). CAR-T cells were also detected in tumor biopsies from all six pts tested. In five pts at progressive disease, the primary or new lesions were CD19 positive, and no CAR-T cells were detected. Conclusions: This first-in-human trial of GC012F for the treatment of r/r DLBCL showed a manageable safety profile and promising clinical responses and a long-lasting duration of a remission. Overall, CD19-BCMA dual targeting CAR-T product GC012F is a promising therapy for r/r DLBCL pts and longer follow-up is ongoing. Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2100047061 .">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Modern immunotherapy approaches are revolutionizing the treatment scenario of relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM) patients, providing an opportunity to reach deep level of responses and extend survival outcomes. Areas covered Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and T-cell redirecting treatments, including bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells therapy, have been recently introduced in the treatment of RRMM. Some agents have already received regulatory approval, while newer constructs, novel combinations, and applications in earlier lines of therapy are currently being explored. This review discusses the current landscape and possible development of ADCs, BsAbs and CAR-T cells immunotherapies. Expert Opinion ADCs, BsAbs, and CAR-T therapy have demonstrated substantial activity in heavily pretreated, triple-class exposed (TCE) MM patients, and T-cell redirecting treatments represent new standards of care after third (European Medicines Agency, EMA), or fourth (Food and Drug Administration, FDA), line of therapy. All these three immunotherapies carry advantages and disadvantages, with different accessibility and new toxicities that require appropriate management and guidelines. Multiple on-going programs include combinations therapies and applications in earlier lines of treatment, as well as the development of novel agents or construct to enhance potency, reduce toxicity and facilitate administration. Sequencing is a challenge, with few data available and mechanisms of resistance still to be unraveled.">

        <tr id="7544 Background: The activity and safety ofARI0002h, an academic autologous CAR T-cell product with a humanized single chain variable fragment targeting BCMA has been reported in a pilot multicenter clinical trial (CARTBCMA-HCB-01) treating 30 patients (pts) with RRMM (NCT04309981) (Oliver-Caldés, Lancet Onc 2023). Here, we describe results of the final cohort of 60 pts with longer follow-up. Methods: Patients aged 18-75 years old with RRMM were eligible if they had measurable disease, were refractory to the last line of treatment and received ≥2 prior regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug and an anti-CD38 antibody. The target dose (3x106/kg CAR+cells) was administered in a fractionated manner (10%/30%/60%). A second dose of up to 3x106 CAR+ cells/kg was planned at least 3 months after the first dose in pts with any kind of response and no limiting side effects. Primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) within the first 3 months and rate of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and/or neurotoxicity in the first 30 days. Bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) was analyzed by next-generation flow at a sensitivity of 10-6. Results: As of December 18th 2023, 72 pts with RRMM were screened, 69 underwent apheresis and 61 received LD, with 60 pts finally receiving ARI0002h. The ORR in the first 3 months was 95% (≥ very good partial response (VGPR) in 77%). Median time to first response was one month. Responses deepened over time, achieving 58% complete response (CR) (55% stringent CR). MRD-negative rates on evaluable samples on days 28 and 100 were 98% and 96%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 24 months (95%CI 9.8-39.9), estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) was 20 months (95% CI 13.2-26.8). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached with OS rate at 24 months of 63%. CRS was observed in 90% with 5% grades ≥ 3. Median time to CRS was 7 days (1-14) with a median duration of 4.5 days. Mild acute neurotoxicity was reported in only 2 pts (3%) with no late neurologic events. 6 pts (10%) developed a macrophage activation syndrome (4 grades 1-2, 1 grade 3, 1 grade 5). Seven patients (11.7%) developed second primary malignancies after ARI0002h infusion, including 3 skin cancers (one in situ melanoma), 3 solid tumors and one acute myeloid leukemia. 80% (44 out of 5) eligible pts had already received the booster dose, with no relevant toxicities. Median time after first infusion was 4.4 months. Response was evaluable in 42 pts; 45% (n=19) were already in sCR, 29% (n=12) maintained the response and 26% (n=11) improved the response. Conclusions: Results from 60 pts and a longer follow-up confirm the safety profile and the deep and durable responses obtained after ARI0002h infusion. Clinical trial information: NCT04309981 .">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with targeting CD30-expressing Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and immune checkpoint modulation induced by combination therapies of CTLA-4 and PD1.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, trial NCT01896999 enrolled patients with refractory or relapsed HL (R/R HL) after one or more lines of therapy, with adequate performance status and organ function. Using peripheral blood, we assessed soluble proteins, cell composition, T cell clonality, and tumor antigen-specific antibodies in 54 patients enrolled in the phase 1 component of the trial.


RESULTS
NCT01896999 reported high (>75%) overall objective response rates with brentuximab-vedotin (BV) in combination with ipilimumab (I) and/or nivolumab (N) in patients with R/R HL. We observed durable increase in soluble PD-1 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells as well as decreases in plasma CCL17, ANGPT2, MMP12, IL13, and CXCL13 in N-containing regimens (BV+N and BV+I+N) compared with BV+I (p<0.05). Non-responders and patients with short progression free-survival showed elevated CXCL9, CXCL13, CD5, CCL17, adenosine-deaminase, and MUC16 at baseline or after one treatment cycle and a higher prevalence of NY-ESO-1-specific autoantibodies (p<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest a circulating tumor-immune-derived signature of BV±I+N treatment resistance that may be useful for patient stratification in combination checkpoint therapy.">

        <tr id="Background The primary treatment for acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone (IVMP). However, the mechanisms through which corticosteroid treatment impacts acute neuroinflammation in people with MS (pwMS) remain not fully understood. In particular, the changes induced by glucocorticoids (GCs) on cells of the innate immune system and the differences between patients with distinct immunotherapies have received little attention to date. Methods We conducted immunophenotyping using flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of pwMS who received IVMP treatment during a relapse. We compared the impact of an IVMP treatment on a broad variety of immune cell subsets within three groups: twelve patients who were treatment-naïve to disease modifying therapies (wDMT) to ten patients on platform therapies (PT) and eighteen patients on fingolimod therapy (FTY). Results We observed pronounced interindividual short- and intermediate-term effects of IVMP on distinct immune cells subsets. In addition to the well-documented decrease in T-helper cells (Th cells), we detected significant alterations after the first IVMP infusion within the innate immune response among neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil granulocytes, monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). When comparing patients wDMT to the PT and FTY cohorts, we found that IVMP had a similar impact on innate immune cells across all treatment groups. However, we did not observe a significant further decline in T lymphocyte counts during IVMP in patients with pre-existing lymphopenia under FTY treatment. Although T cell apoptosis is considered the main mechanism of action of GCs, patients with FTY still reported symptom improvement following IVMP treatment. Conclusion In addition to T cell suppression, our data suggests that further immunoregulatory mechanisms of GC, particularly on cells of the innate immune response, are of greater significance than previously understood. Due to the regulation of the adaptive immune cells by DMTs, the impact of GC on these cells varies depending on the underlying DMT. Additional studies involving larger cohorts and cerebrospinal fluid samples are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the immune response to GC in pwMS with different DMTs during relapse to define and explain differences in clinical response profiles.">

        <tr id="2553 Background: Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising approach that uses viruses to target and destroy cancer cells while activating an anti-tumor immune response. However, a major challenge is the rapid elimination of oncolytic viruses (OVs) by the patient’s immune system. Calidi’s innovative platform addresses this issue by combining allogeneic stem cells with an OV payload, preventing immune system elimination, and promoting viral amplification at tumor sites. This induces immunogenic cell death and stimulates potent anti-tumor immune responses, effectively targeting primary and metastatic tumors. Prior clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of autologous stem cells loaded with Vaccinia virus CAL1 (ACAM2000) in multiple tumor types, especially when combined with checkpoint inhibitors. However, this approach is costly, lacks scalability and reproducibility. To overcome those limitations, we developed CLD-201 (or SuperNova-1), an innovative concept based on CAL1-loaded allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells, specifically designed for intratumoral administration. This study presents selected non-clinical studies performed to support the upcoming clinical trial to treat multiple solid tumors. Methods: We tested the tumor selectivity and efficacy of CLD-201 in Melanoma, Triple Negative Breast Cancer, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. We also assessed its ability to kill cancer cells in the presence of complement and neutralizing antibodies. Immune cell infiltration in treated and untreated tumors was analyzed using flow cytometry. We conducted dose escalation, safety, toxicology, and biodistribution studies of CLD-201 in multiple immune-compromised and immunocompetent mouse models. Results: Vaccinia virus CAL1 showed preferential amplification in tumor cells and, when loaded into adipose stem cells (CLD-201), demonstrated greater resistance to inactivation by the humoral immune system compared to the unprotected CAL1 virus. CLD-201 significantly inhibited the growth of tumors even at a very low dose of 1.5x103 cells containing 1.6x104viral plaque-forming units (PFU). Massive CD4 and CD8 T-cell infiltrations were detected in both treated and untreated tumors. CLD-201’s safety profile is studied in both GLP and non-GLP toxicology/ biodistribution nonclinical studies. Conclusions: CLD-201 offers several important advantages over the autologous approach, including enhanced potency through significant viral amplification within the stem cells, improved manufacturing reproducibility, off-the-shelf ability to treat multiple cancer types, and significantly lower cost. Non-clinical studies revealed that both intratumoral and systemic administration were well-tolerated. A phase I non-randomized clinical trial has been designed to evaluate the safety and initial anti-tumor effects of intratumoral administration of CLD-201.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is a rapidly developing new immunotherapy in recent years. Compared with other therapies, CAR-T has significant advantages for high-risk and relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) patients. Currently, a variety of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of B-NHL, such as axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecucel, lisocababtagene maraleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel. In addition, many studies are actively exploring and developing different targeted CAR-T cells, which show great potential in B-NHL. This review briefly summarized the latest research progress on the application of CAR-T in common B-NHL.">

        <tr id="7520 Background: There are 2 CAR-T products and 3 bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that are FDA-approved for patients (pts) with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Clinical trials experience to date suggests that clinical response of BsAb is less impacted after CAR-T therapy. We examined the outcome of pts who received BsAb in standard-of-care (SOC) practice at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Methods: Retrospective analysis of MM patients who received FDA-approved BsAb at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between 12/2022- 1/2024. IMWG criteria was used for clinical response. Results: Sixty-two patients received BsAbs: 77% (48/62) received teclistamab, and 23% (14/62) received talquetamab. Median age was 62 years (range: 33-81), 60% (37/62) were males, and 45% (28/62) received prior CAR-T. Patients who had prior CAR-T therapy had more prior lines of therapy compared to those who did not. Overall, ORR to teclistamab was 61%, which is comparable to previous studies and other real-world reports. ORR and ≥CR rates were comparable between patients with and without prior CAR-T (Table). Of the 28 pts who received CAR-T before BsAbs, 61% (17/28) received idecabtagene vicleucel, 10% (3/28) were ciltacabtagene autoleucel, and 29% (8/28) on clinical trial. We then compared outcome of BsAb between pts who had relapsed from CAR-T within 1 year (n=21, median PFS: 8.84 months (range, 1.12, 10.84)) or after 1 year (n=7, median PFS: 16.62 months (range, 13.30, 36.20)). At the time of BsAb infusion, pts with who relapsed < 1 year vs ≥1 year post CAR-T had comparable blood counts, ALC, M-protein and involved FLC levels, CRP, ferritin and LDH. BsAb CR/sCR rate was significantly higher in pts with disease relapse ≥1 year compared to <1 year post CAR-T (57% vs 14%, p=0.02). Conclusions: Irrespective of prior CAR-T exposure, BsAb have clinical activity in SOC practice in pts with MM. Our preliminary data suggest that responses to BsAbs are better in pts with late compared to early relapse post CAR-T. Longer follow-up is needed to understand the duration of response. Larger, multi-center studies with longer follow-up will help identify factors that impact BsAb response post CAR-T.[Table: see text]">

        <tr id="8090 Background: Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3 (DLL3) is highly expressed on the cell surface of neuroendocrine carcinomas, which have few approved treatment options in the refractory, metastatic setting. HPN328 is DLL3-targeting T-cell engager. HPN328 has 3 binding domains including anti-DLL3 for target engagement, anti-albumin for half-life extension, and anti-CD3 for T cell engagement and activation. Methods: Pts with relapsed/refractory, metastatic SCLC, neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and other NEC associated with DLL3 expression are eligible. Primary objectives are safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK). Secondary objectives are immunogenicity and efficacy. Overall response rate (ORR) is determined using modified RECIST v1.1 to include extracranial response assessment for pts treated with radiotherapy for brain metastases while on treatment. HPN328 is administered IV QW or Q2W with priming dose preceding target dose in higher dose cohorts. Results: As of January 5, 2024, 86 pts received HPN328 doses of 0.015-24 mg across 14 cohorts (SCLC [n = 54;63%]; other NEC [n = 32;37%]). The median (range) number of prior regimens was 3 (1-7); 83% previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 blocker. Treatment is ongoing in 24 of 46 (52%) pts in the dose optimization cohorts (1 mg priming dose with 12 or 24 mg target doses QW or Q2W). Treatment-related AEs in ≥ 10% of pts included CRS (59% [30% G1, 26% G2, 3% G3+]), dysgeusia (36%), fatigue (34%), diarrhea (19%), nausea (17%), vomiting (14%), decreased appetite and decreased neutrophil count (13% each), and weight decreased (11%). No G3-4 CRS was seen at target doses. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) occurred in 9% of pts, all G1-2. The maximum tolerated priming dose was 1 mg; dose escalation of target dose continued up to 24 mg QW without reaching a maximum tolerated target dose. Among efficacy evaluable pts treated in dose optimization cohorts, the confirmed ORR in SCLC was 50% (12/24), with one complete response (CR). In NEC (other than NEPC) the confirmed ORR was 44% (4/9), with one CR. Four of eleven pts with NEPC had unconfirmed PRs in 1 mg priming dose cohorts, with 5 NEPC pts remaining on treatment > 20 weeks. HPN328 exhibited linear PK with dose-proportional increases in exposure and a median T1/2 of 71 hrs. Transient increases in cytokines up to 24 hrs post-dose and T-cell activation were observed. Conclusions: HPN328 is well tolerated and clinically active in SCLC, NEC, and NEPC. Current dose optimization cohorts have completed enrollment and data continue to mature; selection of a recommended phase 2 dose will be made based upon complete mature data. Updated safety and efficacy results will be presented. Clinical trial information: NCT04471727 .">

        <tr id="The current treatment for neuroblastoma involves an immunotherapy regimen that includes a monoclonal antibody that recognizes disialoganglioside (GD2), expressed at high levels on neuroblastoma. GD2 is not present on most normal tissues but is expressed on nerves. Thus, anti-GD2 treatment causes substantial, dose-limiting, neuropathic pain. B7-H3 is overexpressed on multiple tumor types, including neuroblastoma, with minimal normal cell expression and is absent on nerves. We designed a bispecific antibody (bsAb) that requires simultaneous binding of these two tumor antigens to achieve tight-binding of tumor cells. Our preclinical research shows that when compared to an anti-GD2 monospecific antibody, the GD2xB7-H3 bsAb has improved tumor specificity with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. Since this bsAb does not bind to nerves, it may be possible to administer increased or additional doses beyond the tolerable dose of monospecific anti-GD2 antibodies, which could improve therapeutic efficacy and quality of life for patients with neuroblastoma.">

        <tr id="TPS2678 Background: Engineered T cell therapies such as CAR-T cell therapies have transformed the treatment of B-cell but not non-B cell hematologic malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains the best curative option for hematologic malignancies but ~40% of patients relapse post-HCT with up to 90% mortality due to residual disease post-HCT. A potential solution is targeting minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs) that are homogenously expressed on all hematopoietic cells and are genetically mismatched between donors and patients undergoing HCT. These mismatches enable engineered T cells to selectively eliminate residual patient hematopoietic cells, normal or malignant, leaving donor cells untouched. TScan has developed allogeneic donor derived T-cell products TSC-100 and TSC-101, targeting MiHAs HA-1 and HA-2 respectively, both presented on HLA-A*02:01. By choosing HCT patients who are HLA-A*02:01 positive (>98% of whom are either HA-1 or HA-2 positive) and donors who are either HLA-A*02:01 or MiHA negative, TSC-100 or TSC-101 can potentially eliminate all residual patient-derived hematopoietic cells after HCT, to prevent disease relapse. Methods: Study NCT05473910 is a multi-center, multi-arm, non-randomized controlled Phase 1 umbrella study evaluating the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of TSC-100 and TSC-101. Inclusion criteria include adults with AML, MDS or ALL eligible for reduced intensity conditioning-based haploidentical donor transplantation from HLA or MiHA mismatched donors. HLA-A*02:01-positive patients undergo HA-1/ HA-2 testing and are assigned to either TSC-100 or TSC-101 treatment arms in addition to HCT. HLA-A*02:01-negative patients in the control arm receive HCT alone. Upon count recovery after HCT, patients in treatment arms receive either TSC-100 or TSC-101, administered as single or two doses. Primary endpoints include adverse event profiles and dose limiting toxicities. Secondary endpoints include relapse rates, disease-free survival and overall survival. Exploratory endpoints include surrogates of efficacy such as donor chimerism rates and kinetics and minimal residual disease (MRD) rates. Donor chimerism is measured by standard STR-based and novel high-sensitivity NGS-based assays to quantify residual patient-derived hematopoietic cells. MRD is measured before and after HCT using flow cytometry and NGS. Together, these assays measure elimination of residual patient hematopoietic cells, malignant or normal, and could provide early evidence of biological activity.

        <tr id="Introduction Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas with unacceptably low cure rates occurring often in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 defects. To investigate oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) as an immunotherapeutic approach, we compared viral replication, functional activity, and immune response between unarmed and interleukin 12 (IL-12)-armed oncolytic viruses in virus-permissive (B109) and -resistant (67C-4) murine MPNSTs. Methods This study compared two attenuated IL-12-oHSVs with γ134.5 gene deletions (Δγ134.5) and the same transgene expression cassette. The primary difference in the IL-12-oHSVs was in their ability to counter the translational arrest response in infected cells. Unlike M002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12), C002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12, IRS1) expresses an HCMV IRS1 gene and evades dsRNA activated translational arrest in infected cells. Results and discussion Our results show that oHSV replication and gene expression results in vitro were not predictive of oHSV direct oncolytic activity in vivo. Tumors that supported viral replication in cell culture studies resisted viral replication by both oHSVs and restricted M002 transgene expression in vivo. Furthermore, two IL-12-oHSVs with equivalent transcriptional activity differed in IL-12 protein production in vivo, and the differences in IL-12 protein levels were reflected in immune infiltrate activity changes as well as tumor growth suppression differences between the IL-12-oHSVs. C002-treated tumors exhibited sustained IL-12 production with improved dendritic cells, monocyte-macrophage activity (MHCII, CD80/CD86 upregulation) and a polyfunctional Th1-cell response in the tumor infiltrates. Conclusion These results suggest that transgene protein production differences between oHSVs in vivo, in addition to replication differences, can impact OV-therapeutic activity.">

        <tr id="The spread of cancer from organ to organ (metastasis) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors (IL-6R and IL-8R) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.">

        <tr id="Adoption of allogeneic T cells directly supplements the number of T cells and rapidly induces T-cell immunity, which has good efficacy for treating some tumors and immunodeficiency diseases. However, poor adoptive T-cell engraftment and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) limit the application of these methods. Alloreactive T-cell clones were eliminated from the donor T-cell repertoire, and the remaining T-cell clones were prepared as Tscm for T-cell adoptive treatment to reconstruct recipient T-cell immunity without GVHD.The subjects in this study included three different strains of mice. Lymphocytes from mice (C57BL/6) were used as the donor T-cell repertoire, from which the Tscm allo-reactive T cell clone was depleted (ATD-Tscm). This was confirmed by showing that the Tscm was not responsive to the alloantigen of the recipient (BALB/c). To prepare ATD-Tscm cells, we used recipient lymphocytes as a simulator, and coculture of mouse and recipient lymphocytes was carried out for 7 days. Sorting of non-proliferative cells ensured that the prepared Tscm cells were nonresponsive. The sorted lymphocytes underwent further expansion by treatment with TWS119 and cytokines for an additional 10 days, after which the number of ATD-Tscm cells increased. The prepared Tscm cells were transferred into recipient mice to observe immune reconstitution and GVHD incidence.Our protocol began with the use of 1×107 donor lymphocytes and resulted in 1 ×107 ATD-Tscm cells after 17 days of preparation. The prepared ATD-Tscm cells exhibited a nonresponse upon restimulation of the recipient lymphocytes. Importantly, the prepared ATD-Tscm cells were able to bind long and reconstitute other T-cell subsets in vivo, effectively recognizing and answering the “foreign” antigen without causing GVHD after they were transferred into the recipients.Our strategy was succeeded to prepare ATD-Tscm cells from the donor T-cell repertoire. The prepared ATD-Tscm cells were able to reconstitute the immune system and prevent GVHD after transferred to the recipients. This study provides a good reference for generating ATD-Tscm for T-cell adoptive immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies are FDA approved, and several are under development. While effective for some cancers, toxicities remain a limitation. The most common toxicities, i.e. cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are well described. With increasing utilization, providers worldwide are reporting on other emergent, and often complicated toxicities. Given the evolving toxicity profiles and urgent need to catalogue these emerging and emergent CAR T toxicities and describe management approaches, the American Society of Hematology Subcommittee on Emerging Gene and Cell Therapies organized the first Scientific Workshop on CAR T cell toxicities during the annual society meeting. The workshop functioned to 1) aggregate reports of CAR T emergent toxicities, including movement disorders after BCMA CAR T, coagulation abnormalities, and prolonged cytopenias; 2) disseminate bedside to bench efforts elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms of CAR-T toxicities, including the intestinal microbiota and systemic immune dysregulation; and 3) highlight gaps in the availability of clinical tests such as cytokine measurements, which could be utilized to expand our knowledge around the monitoring of toxicities. Key themes emerged. First, while clinical manifestations may develop before the pathophysiologic mechanisms are understood, these must be studied to aid in the detection and prevention of such toxicities. Second, systemic immune dysregulation appears central to these emergent toxicities and research is needed to elucidate links between tumor, CAR T, and microbiota. Finally, there was consensus around an urgency to create a repository to capture emergent CAR-T toxicities and the real-world management.">

        <tr id="2574 Background: While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, they are less effective in treating solid tumors, which is in part due to the poor persistence and decreased survival of these cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling axis has emerged as a promising target to remodel the TME to make it more immune favorable, and work from our group previously demonstrated that STING agonists could improve the persistence and antitumor activity of CAR T cells in an immunocompetent murine breast tumor model. Yet, the T cell intrinsic effect of STING activation is thought to decrease T cell proliferation and lead to T cell death. Thus, we sought to better understand the impact of activating STING in different T cell subsets to be able to more effectively target STING as an adjunct to cellular therapies. Methods: Primary T cell cultures generated from murine splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were polarized in vitro towards either a Th/Tc1 or Th/Tc17 lineage and treated with the mammalian STING agonist 2’3’-cGAMP. Cells were subsequently characterized by immunophenotyping, bioenergetic analysis, and RNA sequencing. Adoptive cell transfer experiments in a murine melanoma model and an immunocompetent murine breast cancer model utilizing an anti-Neu CAR T cell were employed to determine the differential impact of STING agonism on T cell subsets in vivo. Results: While treatment of Th/Tc1 cells with cGAMP led to impaired proliferation and T cell death, Th/Tc17 cells were immune to this effect. Instead, cGAMP triggered activation of a non-canonical STING pathway in Th/Tc17 cells resulting in metabolic reprogramming in favor of fatty acid oxidation over glycolysis. Th/Tc17 cells treated with cGAMP assumed more of a stem like memory T cell phenotype and displayed a more favorable bioenergetic profile with improved mitochondrial health and decreased reactive oxygen species production. Adoptive transfer of cGAMP conditioned Th/Tc17 memory like cells enhanced tumor control in an aggressive murine melanoma model, which was secondary to improved persistence of T cells in the TME. Further, while intratumoral delivery of STING agonists augmented the antitumor activity of Th/Tc17 cells, the function of Th/Tc1 cells was impeded by activating STING. Conclusions: STING activation in T cells leads to differential responses within T cell subsets as Th/Tc17 cells uniquely shift to a more fit T cell with improved antitumor properties. As cGAMP is found in the tumor microenvironment and can be secreted by tumor cells, CAR T cells with a greater Th/Tc17 footprint may be able to better subsist in the TME. Our findings also provide insight into how to engineer cellular therapies to take advantage of this non-canonical pathway to optimize the integration of STING based therapeutics into patient treatments.">

        <tr id="e19011 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy can induce durable remission in some patients but requires time for a patient’s own cells to be reengineered to produce CAR proteins that can bind to and destroy cancer cells. During this time, bridging therapy is often used in debulking to reduce treatment toxicities and to control the disease while waiting for the manufacturing of CAR-T cells. Because bridging therapy often involves systemic treatment, the bridging therapies can induce responses, in and of themselves, in clinical trials testing CAR-T therapies. As such, we sought to assess bridging therapies used in CAR-T trials. Methods: Using the FDA labels (labels.fda.gov) to identify the indications and the pivotal clinical trials that led to the approval of each CAR-T cell therapy, we looked at which bridging therapies were used, whether multiple therapies were combined, response rates, and the reported adverse events associated with bridging therapy. We took note of all relevant comments regarding bridging therapy in the main paper and supplemental results. Results: Of the 11 studies testing CAR-T therapies, 10 reported the bridging therapies that were used in the study. Notably, only three of 11 studies provided clear information about which combinations of bridging therapy treatments were used during the trials. Of those that reported the types of bridging therapies (n=10), the most commonly used bridging therapy was dexamethasone, which was used in every study (10/10). The next three most commonly used treatments include rituximab (6/10), gemcitabine (5/10), and etoposide (5/10). Of the trials, 2/11 clearly reported whether patients had a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or very good partial response (VGPR) to bridging therapy. 5/11 vaguely reported responses, using terminology outside of CR, PR, VGPR. 4/11 trials did not report or mention any response information in regards to bridging therapy. Of all the trials, 1/11 clearly reported adverse events associated with bridging therapy in the supplement, while 10/11 of the trials listed adverse events associated with the treatment groups, without clarifying those associated with bridging. Conclusions: Although patients are often refractory to first-line therapies, which share considerable overlap with the bridging therapies used, these therapies may still induce responses. Despite this possibility, the reporting of bridging therapy combinations and their subsequent response rates and adverse event rates, is highly variable. Of 11 pivotal clinical trials that led to the approval of a CAR-T cell therapy, none clearly reported bridging therapy data that encompassed all three categories (combinations used, response rates, adverse events). What is more, these data were often omitted completely. These findings highlight the need for greater transparency in the reporting of bridging therapy in order to more reliably assess the efficacy of CAR-T therapies.">

        <tr id="Cancers only develop if they escape immunosurveillance, and the success of cancer immunotherapies relies in most cases on their ability to restore effector T-cell functions, particularly IFN-γ production. Revolutionizing the treatment of many cancers, immunotherapies targeting immune checkpoints such as PD1 can increase survival and cure patients. Unfortunately, although immunotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of patients, not all respond to anti-PD1 immunotherapy, making it crucial to identify alternative treatments that could be combined with current immunotherapies to improve their effectiveness. Here, we show that iron supplementation significantly boosts T-cell responses in vivo and in vitro. This boost is associated with a metabolic reprogramming of T cells in favor of lipid oxidation. We also found that the "adjuvant" effect of iron led to a marked slowdown of tumor-cell growth after tumor-cell line transplantation in mice. Specifically, our results suggest that iron supplementation promotes anti-tumor responses by increasing IFN-γ production by T cells. In addition, iron supplementation considerably improves the efficacy of anti-PD1 cancer immunotherapy in mice. Finally, our study suggests that, in cancer patients, the quality and efficacy of the anti-tumor response following anti-PD1 immunotherapy may be modulated by plasma ferritin levels. In summary, our results suggest the benefits of iron supplementation on the reactivation of anti-tumor responses and support the relevance of a fruitful association between immunotherapy and iron supplementation.">

        <tr id="Abstract BACKGROUND Immunotherapy is a developing but challenging field of research for the treatment of central nervous system malignancies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has been effective in treating hematologic malignancies, but that success has not been clinically translated to solid tumors in children. B7-H3 has been identified as a promising immunotherapy target as it is highly expressed in pediatric glioblastoma and correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis. We aim to evaluate a nanobody-based CAR-T cell therapy that binds B7-H3 with high affinity and hypothesize that anti-B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells can effectively kill B7-H3-expressing tumor cells. METHODS B7-H3 nanobodies were isolated from camel phage libraries and cloned into lentiviral CAR-T cell constructs. Human T cells were transduced by lentivirus to express CAR on the surface. Nanobody CAR-T cell functionality was evaluated by an impedance-based cytotoxicity assay and cytokine release was measured by ELISA. CAR-T avidity was quantified by the Lumicks z-Movi assay. In vivo studies are evaluating the efficacy of B7-H3 CAR-T cells in an orthotopic glioblastoma model in immunodeficient mice. Mice were treated with B7-H3 CAR-T cells by intracerebroventricular or intravenous delivery. RESULTS We confirmed high expression of B7-H3 on the surface of three pediatric glioblastoma cell lines by flow cytometry and Quantibrite staining. We confirmed effective killing of B7-H3-expressing tumor cells and the release of high levels of cytokines. B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells were observed to have high avidity compared to control CAR-T cells. In vivo studies are currently ongoing and treatment response will be evaluated by luminescence imaging and endpoint histologic analysis. CONCLUSION We have shown that B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells demonstrate significant preclinical efficacy. It is critical to study CAR-T cell therapy in immunocompetent in vivo models for further development and clinical application.">

        <tr id="Brentuximab vedotin (BV), a conjugate of anti-CD30 antibody and monomethyl auristatin E, has emerged as a promising treatment option for refractory CD30+ mycosis fungoides (MF) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (pcALCL). BV has been shown to be safe and effective in treating Hodgkin's lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. This multicenter, prospective, single-arm phase I/II study evaluated the efficacy of BV in Japanese patients with CD30+ cutaneous lymphomas, namely CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Participants were divided into two groups: those with CD30+ MF or pcALCL (cohort 1, n = 13) and those with CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders other than those in cohort 1 (cohort 2, n = 3). The studied population included the full analysis set (FAS), modified FAS (mFAS), and safety analysis set (SAF). These sets were identified in cohorts 1 and 1 + 2 and labeled FAS1 and FAS2, mFAS1 and mFAS2, and SAF1 and SAF2, respectively. Each treatment cycle lasted 3 weeks, and BV was continued for up to 16 cycles after the third cycle based on treatment response. The primary endpoint was the 4-month objective response rate (ORR4) determined by the Independent Review Forum (IRF). ORR4 was 69.2% for FAS1 and 62.5% for FAS2 (P < 0.0001). Secondary endpoints of ORR, assessed using the global response score (53.8% in FAS1) and modified severity-weighted assessment tool (62.5% in FAS1), using the IRF, provided results comparable to the primary findings. The incidence of ≥grade 3 adverse events (≥15%) in SAF1 was peripheral neuropathy in three patients (23%) and fever and eosinophilia in two patients (15%). In conclusion, BV showed favorable efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The trial was registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry, Japan (protocol ID: UMIN000034205).">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a prototypic autoimmune disease of the CNS. It is the leading cause of chronic neurologic disability in young adults. Proinflammatory B cells and autoreactive T cells both play important roles in its pathogenesis. We aimed to study alterations of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which likely also contribute to the disease, but their involvement is less clear. Methods By combining multiple experimental approaches, we examined the Treg compartments in 41 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 17 healthy donors. Results Patients with MS showed a reduced frequency of CD4+ T cells and Foxp3+ Tregs and age-dependent alterations of Treg subsets. Treg suppressive function was compromised in patients, who were treated with natalizumab, while it was unaffected in untreated and anti-CD20–treated patients. The changes in natalizumab-treated patients included increased proinflammatory cytokines and an altered transcriptome in thymus-derived (t)-Tregs, but not in peripheral (p)-Tregs. Discussion Treg dysfunction in patients with MS might be related to an altered transcriptome of t-Tregs and a proinflammatory environment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Tregs and their subtypes in MS.">

        <tr id="2593 Background: PD-1 blockade has demonstrated positive anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types. While the anti-tumoral response can be substantial and even curative, response rates remain low in many cancer types. Long-lasting responses are only observed in a minority of patients, and additional immunotherapeutic alternatives remain limited for patients who fail to respond or initially respond but subsequently experience progression. Combining anti-PD-1 with other immunotherapies may improve the durability and depth of anti-tumoral immune responses. Non-clinical data suggest anti-PD-1 interactions with macrophage Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) compromise therapeutic activity by several mechanisms including the rapid removal of anti-PD-1 from its target on CD8+ T-cells and phagocytosis of anti-PD-1 coated CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, we and others have shown that blockade of Fc/FcγR interactions with immunocompetent antibodies to the inhibitory FcγRIIB, a receptor highly upregulated in the tumor microenvironment, overcomes these resistance mechanisms and enhances anti-PD-1 efficacy in vitro and in vivo. BI-1206 is a fully human IgG1 targeting CD32b (FcγRIIB). Methods: This is a Ph1/2a trial in patients with advanced solid tumors who received previous lines of treatment with anti-PD 1/PD-L1 agents to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK/PD of BI-1206 at ascending IV and SC doses after coadministration with pembrolizumab Q3W using a mTPI-2 design. Results: Dose escalation with BI-1206 IV has been completed with no formal MTD defined. The most frequent related adverse events were infusion-related reactions, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. All were transient without any clinical consequences, and adequate pre-medication with corticosteroids or split dose administration reduced the risk and/or intensity of these events. Out of 15 evaluable patients, 5 patients showed SD, including one lasting >24 months in a metastatic melanoma patient. Furthermore, long-lasting PR (>24 months) was observed in a uveal melanoma patient, and CR was observed in a metastatic melanoma patient who previously received three prior anti-PD-1 containing treatments (one including anti-CTLA4). Enrollment to BI-1206 SC dose escalation began Nov2023. Dose level and administration route to be further explored in Phase 2a will be determined after an integrated review of PK, PD and safety. The Ph2a consists of 3 expansion cohorts at the RP2D, each comprising a specific subset of subjects with advanced solid tumors (e.g., NSCLC, MM, and other tumors responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition). More than one dose level may be evaluated if warranted. Conclusions: Coadministration of BI-1206 with pembrolizumab was well tolerated in a heavily pretreated population, with promising hints of responses to be further explored in Ph2.

        <tr id="Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Significant unmet need remains for patients with relapsed/refractory FL after ≥3 lines of prior therapy. While recent advancements have likely improved the survival of patients with FL, most patients will eventually relapse. The treatment of patients with FL after multiple relapses or those with refractory disease has historically led to lower overall response rates (ORR) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) with each subsequent line of therapy. New treatments with high ORR and durable PFS are needed in this setting, particularly in patients that progress within 2 years of first line chemoimmunotherapy (POD24) and/or those refractory chemoimmunotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies targeting the B-cell antigen CD-19 have shown to be an efficacious treatment option for both heavily pretreated patients and/or patients with refractory FL, resulting in a high ORR and durable remissions.">

        <tr id="Background Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies have achieved remarkable success in the treatment of hematological tumors. However, given the distinct features of solid tumors, particularly heterogeneity, metabolic aggressiveness, and fewer immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), the practical utility of CAR-T cells for solid tumors remains as a challenging issue. Meanwhile, although anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has shown clinical efficacy, most mAbs also show limited clinical benefits for solid tumors due mainly to the issues associated with the lack of immune cells in TME. Thus, the infiltration of targeted immunological active cells into TME could generate synergistic efficacy for mAbs. Methods We present a combinational strategy for solid tumor treatment, which combines armored-T cells to express Fc-gamma receptor I (FcγRI) fragment on the surfaces for targeting various tumors with therapeutically useful mAbs. Choosing CD20 and HER-2 as the targets, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo efficacy and latent mechanism of the combination drug by using flow cytometry, ELISA and other methods. Results The combination and preprocessing of armored T-cells with corresponding antibody of Rituximab and Pertuzumab exerted profound anti-tumor effects, which is demonstrated to be mediated by synergistically produced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effects. Meanwhile, mAb was able to carry armored-T cell by preprocessing for the infiltration to TME in cell derived xenograft (CDX) model. Conclusions This combination strategy showed a significant increase of safety profiles from the reduction of antibody doses. More importantly, the present strategy could be a versatile tool for a broad spectrum of cancer treatment, with a simple pairing of engineered T cells and a conventional antibody.">

        <tr id="In virotherapy, cancer cells are eradicated via viral infection, replication, and dissemination (oncolysis). Background: This study aims to evaluate the oncolytic potential of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) against colon cancer and explore the immune response associated with its therapeutic effects. Methods: NDV was tested for its oncolytic potential in colon cancer cell lines using MTT assays and apoptosis assessments. Tumor-induced mice were treated with NDV, tumor cell lysate (TCL), or a combination of both. After the euthanasia of murine subjects, an assessment of oncolytic efficacy was performed through flow cytometry analysis of murine blood and tumor tissue, targeting CD83, CD86, CD8, and CD4. An ELISA was also performed to examine interferon-gamma levels, interleukin-4 levels, interleukin-12 levels, and interleukin-10 levels in serum and spleen homogenate. Results: Cell viability was low in HCT116 and HT-29, indicating a cytotoxic effect in the MTT assay. NDV+TCL recorded the highest rate of cell death (56.72%). NDV+TCL had accelerated cell death after 48 h, reaching 58.4%. The flow cytometry analysis of the blood and tumor of mice with induced tumor treated with combined treatment revealed elevated levels of CD83, CD86, CD8, and CD4 (76.3, 66.9, 83.7, and 14.4%, respectively). The ELISA levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-12 in serum and the spleen homogenate were elevated (107.6 ± 9.25 pg/mL). In contrast, the expression of IL-10 was significantly reduced (1 ± 0.79).">

        <tr id="e19050 Background: Tafasitamab (tafa) is a CD19-targeting immunotherapy that induces enhanced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. Tafa received accelerated FDA approval in 2020 for treating relapsed or refractory DLBCL in combination with lenalidomide in patients ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, based on results from L-MIND, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial. FirmMIND (NCT05429268) is an ongoing identical study, further evaluating efficacy and safety of tafa in this setting. Several other CD19 targeting agents are available; however, CD19 antigen loss following treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy targeting CD19 (CART19) has raised concerns over CD19-targeted therapy sequencing. Loss of CD19 has not been observed to date in tafa clinical trials or practice. Methods: To evaluate CD19 expression at screening and after disease progression in firmMIND, we developed an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using a mAb that binds to an intracellular epitope of CD19 clone LE-CD19. To validate that CD19 expression is detectable after tafa treatment, we treated cultured SU-DHL-4 or Jurkat cells with tafa at a saturating concentration for 24 hours. After washing out unbound tafa, cells were harvested at specific timepoints. Resulting cell line blocks were assessed for CD19 expression by IHC. We also monitored CD19 trafficking in response to fluorescently labeled tafa by confocal microscopy. Results: By IHC, CD19 expression was comparable between treatment conditions, suggesting the assay can effectively measure CD19 expression in lymphoma biopsy samples post-tafa. Confocal microscopy showed a fraction of tafa-bound CD19 internalized and colocalized with a CD19 intracellular pool labeled with anti-CD19 mAb clone EPR5906; this mAb also detected CD19 that remained localized on the cell surface. The data demonstrated that CD19 persists on tumor cells after tafa treatment at levels that could be bound by other CD19-targeting therapies. As of the January 25, 2024 data cutoff, we received 6 end-of-treatment (EOT) samples from patients in firmMIND. Biopsies were collected 14-26 days after the last tafa dose; 5 of 6 samples were biopsies from lymph nodes or liver and showed ≥80% of tumor cells staining CD19+ on membranes with 3+ intensity by IHC, except 1 that was collected only 6 days after last dose and showed 50% positivity. The sixth biopsy (extranodal subcutaneous lesion) showed no CD19 expression at baseline or EOT. Conclusions: Patient biopsy analysis and preclinical data suggest that following tafa treatment, CD19 antigen is preserved on the surface of tumor cells after short and transient internalization and could be targeted by other CD19 agents, such as CART therapy. This conclusion is supported by sequential treatment with tafa followed by CART in vivo (Sakemura, 2024). Analyses are ongoing to confirm these findings.">

        <tr id="7060 Background: IMM0306 is a fusion protein of CD20 monoclonal antibody with the CD47 binding domain of SIRPα on both heavy chains. It exerts excellent cancer killing efficacy by activating both macrophages and NK cells via blockade of CD47-SIRPα interaction and FcɣR engagement. Here, we report the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy results of phase I study in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Methods: Eligible pts with R/R CD20-positive B-NHL were enrolled in this multicenter phase I study (NCT05805943). IMM0306 was administered as monotherapy at escalating doses of 0.04, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 mg/kg intravenously once a week until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in the first 28 days. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0, PK and PD analysis were also assessed, tumor assessments performed once every 8 weeks by Lugano 2014 criteria. Results: As of Nov 21, 2023, 48 pts were enrolled. The median age was 56 years with 30 (62.5%) males. The median prior lines of therapy were 2. All pts received previous anti-CD20 therapy. No DLTs were observed. Recommended phase II dose was determined as 2.0 mg/kg. The most frequent treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were WBC decreased (66.7%), anemia (64.6%), lymphocyte decreased (58.3%), ANC decreased (47.9%), PLT decreased (45.8%), infusion-related reactions (35.4%). ≥grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 33 (68.8%) pts, with the most common being lymphocyte decreased (56.3%), WBC decreased (18.8%), ANC decreased (18.8%). 8 (16.7%) pts experienced treatment related serious adverse event. Discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 1 pt (grade 4 PLT decreased at 1.6mg/kg without bleeding). No AE led to death. IMM0306 exhibited approximate dose-proportional increase in PK exposure from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg and no obvious accumulation was observed after repeated dosing. At 1.2 mg/kg and higher dose, CD47 receptor occupancy on peripheral lymphocytes was saturated, suggesting IMM0306 is well tolerated from perspective of CD47 engagement. B-cell depleted rapidly at doses ≥ 0.8 mg/kg. Elevated cytokines levels were observed after first dosing of IMM0306, but multiple dosing did not stimulate further cytokine activation. Among 33 pts who received doses ≥ 0.8 mg/kg, 5 CR (4 follicular lymphoma [FL], 1 marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]), 5 PR (3 FL, 1 MZL, 1 diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and 11 SD were seen; the median PFS was 10.58 months (95% CI, 2.2, NA) and the median OS was not reached. Among 17 FL pts, 7 (41%) responded including 4 CR and 3 PR; among 6 MZL pts, 2 (33.3%) responded including 1 CR and 1 PR. Conclusions: IMM0306 was well-tolerated and with promising preliminary anti-tumor activity especially in pts with R/R FL and MZL. The phase Ⅱ study is ongoing.

 Background: Relapsed/refractory (R/R) aggressive lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma double-hit (HGBCL-DH), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), have poor outcomes with standard therapy. VIP152 (enitociclib) leads to rapid depletion of short-lived mRNA transcripts such as MYC and MCL1 through CDK9 inhibition. Preclinical studies have identified BCL2 overexpression as a mechanism of resistance to CDK9 inhibition, and synergistic cytotoxicity has been shown with venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor), steroids, and CDK9 inhibitors in DLBCL. Based on this preclinical data, we hypothesized that the combination of VIP152 with venetoclax and prednisone (VVIP) would result in acceptable safety and improved efficacy in R/R lymphoid malignancies.
 Methods: R/R non-GCB DLBCL, MYC-rearranged DLBCL/HGBCL-DH, and PTCL pts after 2 prior systemic therapies are eligible. In phase I, pts are treated at 4 dose levels (DL) of VIP152 and venetoclax in combination with fixed-dose prednisone to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). VIP152 (15mg, 22.5mg, or 30mg) is given IV on days 2 and 9 in combination with venetoclax (600mg or 800mg) PO and prednisone 100 mg PO on days 1-10 every 21 days. Phase II expansion cohorts are included at the RP2D. VVIP x 12 cycles is given for pts who achieve complete response (CR), with a max of 24 cycles for pts not in CR. TLS, G-CSF, and PCP prophylaxis are given to all pts. Baseline CT, PET, and BM are performed with CT after cycles 1 and 2 then every 2 cycles and PET after cycles 6 and 12. CT is then performed q3m x 1y, q4m x 1y, q6m x 1y, then q12m x 2y post-therapy.
 Results: As of March 26, 2024, 5 pts were enrolled (3 at DL1 and 2 at DL2), including 3 PTCL, 1 non-GCB DLBCL, and 1 HGBCL-DH. Median (range) age was 56 (55-77) yrs, with stage 3/4 disease in 100%, >/=2 extranodal sites in 100%, IPI >/=3 in 80%, and elevated LDH in 40%. Median (range) prior therapies were 3 (3-6), with prior ASCT, allo-HSCT, and CAR-T in 1 (20%) pt each, and 80% of pts refractory per SCHOLAR-1 criteria. All 5 pts completed the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) window with no DLTs observed. The most common adverse events (AEs) (% pts) included hypokalemia (100%), thrombocytopenia (80%), neutropenia (80%), and anemia (80%). Two (40%) pts had G3-4 neutropenia and 1 (20%) pt had G3 hypokalemia, with no other >/=G3 AEs observed. No dose reductions occurred and only 1 pt required a dose delay due to infection. Tumor reduction was observed in 80% (4/5) of pts, with an overall response rate of 60% (3/5). Partial responses include 1 HGBCL-DH pt refractory to both CAR-T and epcoritamab (71% tumor reduction) and 2 PTCL pts refractory to CHOP and targeted therapy (86% and 91% tumor reduction). Four pts have progressed, and no pts have died.
 Conclusions: Preliminary results show VVIP to be safe and well tolerated with no DLTs observed. Early activity is noted in pts with HGBCL-DH and PTCL. Enrollment continues to identify the RP2D and to further assess the safety and efficacy of VVIP in R/R aggressive lymphomas.

        <tr id="Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors improve antitumor responses The understanding of the immune system has increased considerably in the past 30 years, leading to the development of better therapies for cancer as well as immune-mediated disorders. These advances include unleashing T cell antitumor activity with monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis or jakinibs) that block cytokine signaling for autoimmune, atopic, and inflammatory pathologies (1, 2). On pages 1315 and 1314 of this issue, Zak et al. (3) and Mathew et al. (4), respectively, report that combining these therapeutic approaches results in improved clinical responses compared with immune checkpoint inhibition alone in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma as well as metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These are exciting advances, but at the same time the strategy might seem paradoxical. Why would jakinibs enhance immune-mediated elimination of cancer cells given that they limit lymphocyte activation and proliferation?">

        <tr id="2557 Background: While the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized the field of tumor therapy. the resistance remains a major challenge. We have previously developed WTX-212, an erythrocyte-antibody conjugate covalently linking anti-PD-1 antibody to erythrocyte membranes. Unlike conventional antibodies, WTX-212 exhibits natural accumulation in the spleen and remodels the splenic immune landscape in tumor-bearing mice. WTX-212 treatment efficiently activates CD8+ T cells in the spleen, which subsequently infiltrate into tumors and exhibit anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Additionally, activated T cells reduce the splenic reservoir of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and those within tumors, further enhancing overall anti-tumor responses. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that WTX-212 can significantly suppress tumor growth in xenograft tumor models resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapies. A first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial is now investigating its potential in human cancer patients. Methods: The FIH trial (NCT05707325) is aimed to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of WTX-212 in cancer patients with advanced malignancies. All of patients had previously received anti-PDs therapies and developed resistance to these treatments. By Feb 5th, 2024, the tumor lesions were assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Blood and tumor samples were collected for correlative analysis. Results: 7 metastasized patients with various solid tumors, having undergone a median of 3.1 prior lines of therapy (ranging from 1-6), received WTX-212 monotherapy. None of patients treated with WTX-212 experienced treatment-related adverse events greater than Grade 3, indicating a high safety profile. WTX-212 was detectable in peripheral blood at the end of cycle in a dose dependent manner. Disease control was achieved in 5/7 patients (DCR=71%). Specifically, a patient with esophageal cancer, achieved a confirmed complete remission after 6-cycle treatment. Additionally, two patients, one with esophageal cancer (3L) and another with HPV-negative cervical cancer (4L), maintained stable disease for over 40 and 30 weeks, respectively. Consistent with our pre-clinical findings, a substantial reduction in MDSCs were observed in 6/7 patients (ranging from 24%-82%). Furthermore, a median 1.5-fold increase in T cells was noted in all patients in the peripheral blood after the 1st cycle of the treatment. Conclusions: WTX-212 treatment is safe and tolerable and shows promising clinical signs in cancer patients resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, supporting further investigation and exploration of WTX-212 monotherapy and combination therapy.

        <tr id="TPS1137 Background: BriaCell (BC) human immortalized cell lines have been engineered to trigger robust immune responses and deliver efficacy through diverse mechanisms, including adaptive (involving T-cells) and innate responses (dendritic and NK cells). BC can match patients’ HLA antigens for optimal effectiveness. BC works by several mechanisms, including direct antigen presentation and activation of CD4+ T-cells. When combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, the BC regimen has demonstrated clinical benefit in 54 heavily treated MBCs. Most pts whose disease has progressed after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy showed similar or improved PFS compared to the patient's last treatment regimen. Disease control after prior antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has been observed in 40% of patients, and clinical benefit has been seen in 5/7 patients with untreated intracranial metastases. CD8+ Immuno PET shows an increase in CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes suggesting systemic activation and infiltration into lymphoid organs and metastatic sites. Sequencing of CPI with BC and the latest phase 3 formulation are associated with improved clinical outcomes, including OS (median 13.4 months), PFS, and CBR, which are reflected in the design of this ongoing pivotal registration enabling Phase 3 study [doi:10.1158/1538-7445.sabcs22-p3-07-12]. Methods: Multicenter randomized, open label Bria-IMT regimen (with SV-BR-1-GM cells) plus CPI vs Treatment of Physicians' Choice (TPC) in MBCs with no approved curative therapies available. ECOG <2 allowed with no limit on prior therapies. Eligibility encompasses all MBC subtypes including pts with CNS metastases. Prior immune therapy is allowed if administered more than 21 days before the first cycle of Bria-IMT; treatments within 21 days preclude participation. Initial randomization will be 1:1:1 to the Bria-IMT regimen + CPI (combination), TPC, and the Bria-IMT regimen alone (monotherapy). There will be 100 sites across the US, Canada, and ex-NA for 404 total evaluable pts. The Bria-IMT regimen includes: Day -2 Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2, Day 0 20 million irradiated SV-BR-1-GM cells intradermally, and 0.1mcg peg α interferon intra-dermally (Day 2 or 3) into each Bria-IMT inoculation site. After the first 150 pts have enrolled, the monotherapy arm will be discontinued. Bria regimen + CPI arms treatment cycles occur q3w. CPI infusion is given every cycle between Day –3 to Day 3 TPC cycle details will be according to the site's SOC. Imaging assessment will be q6w x2 then q8w. The primary endpoint is overall survival with an interim analysis at 144 events targeting a hazard ratio of 0.6.

        <tr id="Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) has been traditionally treated using glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants. However, these treatment modes are associated with high recurrence AAV rates and adverse reactions. Therefore, treatment strategies for AAV need to be urgently optimized. The efficacy and safety of biological agents in the treatment of vasculitis have been clinically validated. This review comprehensively summarizes the evidence-based support for the clinical use of existing biological agents in AAV. The findings reveal that multiple biological agents not only effectively reduce the adverse reactions associated with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants but also demonstrate significant therapeutic efficacy. Notably, rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, has emerged as a first-line treatment option for AAV. Mepolizumab has shown promising results in relapsed and refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Other biological agents targeting cytokines, complement, and other pathways have also demonstrated clinical benefits in recent studies. The widespread application of biological agents provides new insights into the treatment of AAV and is expected to drive further clinical research. These advancements not only improve patient outcomes but also offer more possibilities and hope in the field of AAV treatment.">

        <tr id="The identification and targeting of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) through immunotherapeutic strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells), and T-cell engagers (TCE) have revolutionized the care of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). These treatment modalities have improved survival outcomes of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) MM patients compared to previously established strategies and are moving into earlier lines of therapy (LOT). Despite their efficacy, the majority of patients eventually relapse, necessitating additional therapeutic targets for salvage. G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D), Fc receptor-homolog 5 (FcRH5), and SLAMF7 are some examples of novel targets in development. This expanding armamentarium of immunotherapeutic agents will be crucial to address the unmet need for relapses following BCMA-targeting therapies, particularly antigen-negative relapses. The utilization of sequential T-cell redirective therapies including agents targeting different tumor-associated antigens and combination therapies appears feasible paves the way for effective chemotherapy-free regimes. Deliberate consideration of treatment timing, preserving T-cell health, overcoming antigenic loss, and comprehension of the complex tumor microenvironment would be key to maximizing therapeutic benefits and minimizing adverse effects. This review summarizes novel targets in development for myeloma beyond BCMA, presenting pivotal safety and efficacy data derived from clinical trials where available and the considerations vital for navigating this expanding landscape of immunotherapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy. In the context of the current standard of care therapies in Canada, outcomes among patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), particularly those with triple-class (or more) refractory disease remain poor. Immunotherapies have significantly changed the treatment landscape of MM. Since 2021, two BCMA-targeting CAR T-cell therapy products have been approved for RRMM—namely Idecabtagene vicleucel (Ide-cel) (ABECMA®) and Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Cilta-cel) (CARVYKTI®), both of which are available in the US and Europe. Although they have shown unprecedented efficacy in RRMM, their clinical and logistical limitations must be acknowledged. MM CAR T-cell therapy is likely to be approved in Canada soon. Therefore, it is timely that we review the latest evidence for commercially available CAR T-cell therapy in multiple myeloma, with a focus on its relevance and impact in the Canadian setting. There will be challenges to access and strategies must be in place to ensure equitable care for all Canadians with MM. Alongside haematologists working in the immune effector cell therapy programs, providers in the community will also play a role in the ongoing monitoring and management of long-term side effects including opportunistic infections and late neurotoxicity.">

        <tr id="e19000 Background: B-cell-Activating Factor-Receptor (BAFF-R), predominantly expressed on the surface of the mature B cells, including malignant B cells, serves as an attractive therapeutic target for the diseases where CD19 or CD20-targeted therapies encounter challenges, such as loss of therapeutic targets or development of resistance. No BAFF-R targeting agent has been approved yet for clinical use to date. ESG206, a recombinant humanized anti-BAFF-R monoclonal antibody modified by glycoengineering for enhanced ADCC effects, is being developed as a treatment for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies. Preclinical investigations have successfully validated the antitumor effects of ESG206 across a spectrum of malignant B cell disease models, including lymphoma xenografts which were resistant to Rituximab, and Ibrutinib. This report provides preliminary clinical safety, PK, PD, and efficacy results from an FIH study of ESG206 in patients with R/R B-cell malignancies. Methods: This Phase I, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study enrolled patients with R/R B-cell malignancies resistant to standard therapy. Dose escalation utilized accelerated titration (1 mg/kg) and Bayesian Optimal Interval design (3, 6, and 9 mg/kg). ESG206 was administered intravenously every 2 weeks, with a 4-week cycle, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. DLT was assessed in the first 28 days. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0. Tumor assessments every 8 weeks, and peripheral CD20-positive B cell counts as a PD marker were evaluated. Results: As of Jan 30th, 2024, data cut-off date, 6 pts (3 follicular lymphoma (FL), 3 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) were enrolled, with a median age of 56 years, 83.3% female; median 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1-3). No DLTs were observed up to 6 mg/kg Q2W. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included anemia (n=2), decreased white blood cell count (n=1), hyperlipidemia (n=1, grade 2), elevated bilirubin (n=1), diarrhea (n=1), infusion reactions (n=1, grade 2), upper respiratory infections (n=1, grade 2), etc. No grade≥3 TRAEs occurred. Among 6 evaluable patients, 1 FL patient (3 mg/kg Q2W) and 1 DLBCL patient (3 mg/kg Q2W) achieved partial response. After 2 cycles of treatment, there was a 39.5% size reduction in the brain lesions of an FL patient who had intracranial metastases in baseline, suggesting that ESG206 may have a therapeutic effect on brain metastases. A significant decrease in the peripheral CD20+B cells was observed at both 1 and 3 mg/kg Q2W dose levels. ESG206 exposure increased with dose escalation across the 1–3 mg/kg dose range. Conclusions: Preliminary data indicates ESG206 is well-tolerated with promising efficacy signals in R/R B-cell malignancies. These encouraging results warrant continued clinical evaluation as the Phase I study progresses. Clinical trial information: NCT05263739 .">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The last decade has seen dramatic changes in cancer treatment. Various methods of the immunotherapy of solid tumors, including treatment with targeted monoclonal antibodies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, bi- or trispecific immune cell enhancers, and antibody derivatives (e.g., antibody–drug conjugates), in addition to adoptive cell transfer or cell therapy, are being actively developed. A number of these approaches target tumor cells directly, while several other strategies aim to neutralize immunosuppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and transform TME from immunologically “cold” to “hot”. Although many of these approaches have received clinical approval, each has inherent limitations that are considered in this review. Additionally, we discuss recent innovations in immunotherapy to improve clinical efficacy in solid tumors and strategies to overcome the limitations of various immunotherapy. Abstract In recent years, the arrival of the immunotherapy industry has introduced the possibility of providing transformative, durable, and potentially curative outcomes for various forms of malignancies. However, further research has shown that there are a number of issues that significantly reduce the effectiveness of immunotherapy, especially in solid tumors. First of all, these problems are related to the protective mechanisms of the tumor and its microenvironment. Currently, major efforts are focused on overcoming protective mechanisms by using different adoptive cell therapy variants and modifications of genetically engineered constructs. In addition, a complex workforce is required to develop and implement these treatments. To overcome these significant challenges, innovative strategies and approaches are necessary to engineer more powerful variations of immunotherapy with improved antitumor activity and decreased toxicity. In this review, we discuss recent innovations in immunotherapy aimed at improving clinical efficacy in solid tumors, as well as strategies to overcome the limitations of various immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a multifaceted condition characterized by significant diversity in its molecular and pathological subtypes and clinical manifestation. Despite the progress made in the treatment of DLBCL through the development of novel drugs, an estimated one-third of patients encounter relapse or acquire refractory disease. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of DLBCL, a complex network consisting of cellular and noncellular components that engage in interactions with the tumor, is a parameter that is gaining increasing attention. The TME comprises both the immune and nonimmune microenvironments. The immune microenvironment comprises natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T and B lymphocytes. The nonimmune microenvironment consists of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stromal cells, and other molecules that are secreted. Despite ongoing research, the exact impact of these components and their interaction on the progression of the disease remains elusive. A comprehensive review of significant discoveries concerning the cellular and noncellular constituents, molecular characteristics, and treatment response and prognosis of the TME in DLBCL, as well as the potential targeting of the TME with novel therapeutic approaches, is provided in this article.">

        <tr id="Mosunetuzumab (Mosun) is a CD20xCD3 T‐cell engaging bispecific antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. The approved step‐up dose regimen of 1/2/60/30 mg IV is designed to mitigate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and maximize efficacy in early cycles. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model was developed from 439 patients with relapsed/refractory B‐Cell Non‐Hodgkin lymphoma receiving Mosun IV monotherapy, including fixed dosing (0.05–2.8 mg IV every 3 weeks (q3w)) and Cycle 1 step‐up dosing groups (0.4/1/2.8–1/2/60/30 mg IV q3w). Prior to Mosun treatment, ~50% of patients had residual levels of anti‐CD20 drugs (e.g., rituximab or obinutuzumab) from prior treatment. CD20 receptor binding dynamics and rituximab/obinutuzumab PK were incorporated into the model to calculate the Mosun CD20 receptor occupancy percentage (RO%) over time. A two‐compartment model with time‐dependent clearance (CL) best described the data. The typical patient had an initial CL of 1.08 L/day, transitioning to a steady‐state CL of 0.584 L/day. Statistically relevant covariates on PK parameters included body weight, albumin, sex, tumor burden, and baseline anti‐CD20 drug concentration; no covariate was found to have a clinically relevant impact on exposure at the approved dose. Mosun CD20 RO% was highly variable, attributed to the large variability in residual baseline anti‐CD20 drug concentration (median = 10 μg/mL). The 60 mg loading doses increased Mosun CD20 RO% in Cycle 1, providing efficacious exposures in the presence of the competing anti‐CD20 drugs. PopPK model simulations, investigating Mosun dose delays, informed treatment resumption protocols to ensure CRS mitigation.">

        <tr id="e14593 Background: IBI363 is a first-in-class PD-1/IL-2α-bias bispecific antibody fusion protein which could block PD-1 checkpoint and rejuvenate exhausted tumor-specific T cells by cis-activating α-bias IL-2. It was well tolerated and showed encouraging efficacy in patients (pts) with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Herein, we report a phase I study of IBI363 in patients (pts) with other solid tumors. Methods: Eligible pts with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cervical cancer (CC) and ovarian cancer (OC) who failed or intolerant to standard therapy were enrolled. IBI363 was intravenously administered at different dose levels ranging from 600 to 1500 μg/kg QW/Q2W/Q3W. Primary objective of the study was safety. Secondary objective was efficacy assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 including objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Results: As of January 26, 2024, 24 pts were enrolled including 13 pts with BTC, 3 pts with HNSCC, 4 pts with CC and 4 pts with OC. In BTC, 6 (46.2%) pts received IBI363 treatment for more than 3 months and the maximum treatment duration was 7 months. In HNSCC, CC and OC, the maximum treatment duration was 4.6, 6.2 and 6.5 months respectively. Pts with at least 1 tumor assessment were included in efficacy evaluable set (n = 18). The overall ORR was 22.2% and DCR was 77.8%. In 11 evaluable pts with BTC, best overall response (BOR) was confirmed partial response (cPR) in 1 pt (600 μg/kg Q2W, immunotherapy (IO)-failed), stable disease (SD) in 9 pts (including 6 pts with tumor regression) and progressive disease (PD) in 1 pt. ORR was 9.1% and DCR was 90.9%. In 2 evaluable pts with HNSCC, 1 pt had cPR (600 μg/kg Q2W, IO-naïve, PD-L1 expression negative) and 1 pt had PD. In 3 evaluable pts with CC, 1 pt had cPR (1000 μg/kg Q2W, IO-failed), 1 pt had SD and 1 pt had PD. In 2 evaluable pts with OC, 1 pt had cPR (1000 μg/kg Q2W, platinum-resistant) and 1 pt had PD. All cPR pts had previous 1-2 lines of treatments and had tumor regression ranging from 45% to 87%. Durable tumor responses were observed with cPR remained at week 30 in BTC and remained at week 24 in HNSCC, CC and OC. In 4 pts with cPR, 3 pts still on treatment and 1 pt with HNSCC received curative resection. No new safety signals of IBI363 were observed. More updated data on safety and efficacy will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: IBI363 showed promising and durable efficacy in pts with various solid tumors including refractory tumors such as BTC and IO or platinum-resistant tumors such as CC and OC. Further clinical investigations on these tumors using IBI363 alone or in combination with other treatments are ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT05460767 .">

 Intravesical therapies have been the mainstay of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (BC) management; however, their efficacy is limited by toxicities, recurrences, and supply shortages. Consequently, many patients are recommended cystectomy, which is fraught with high complication rates. Thus, bladder-sparing treatments present a major, unmet clinical need. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, wherein T cells are engineered to express an artificial receptor to a target, is an immunotherapeutic approach with efficacy in hematologic malignancies. Similar success in solid tumors has been hindered by a lack of suitable targets, reduced T cell infiltration/activity, and major toxicities, including on-target off-tumor effects and cytokine release syndromes. To overcome these limitations, locoregional delivery of CAR T cells is being investigated. Yet, to date, no studies have examined their potential as intravesical therapies. In this study, we used a computational pipeline using large-scale BC transcriptomics data to discover potential CAR targets which met strict criteria of high cell-surface expression on BC and minimal expression on normal tissue. We identified MUC16, a surface-bound mucinous glycoprotein, as a top candidate from this pipeline, which has more reduced pan-tissue expression than targets of precision-guided therapies in BC. Consistent with prior reports, MUC16 transcript and protein levels increase with grade and T stage and correlates with chemotherapeutic resistance. We also find MUC16 expression persists in recurrent tumors after BCG-therapy. To target MUC16, we designed second-generation CARs based on scFv derived from the antibody 3a5 (3a5-28z) and natural-ligands based on the high-affinity MUC16-mesothelin interaction (MSLN-28z) or its truncated binding domain (truncMSLN-28z) which were fused to CD28 co-stimulatory domains and CD3z chains of the T cell receptor. Using human BC lines with a broad range of MUC16 levels, we show MSLN-28z more effectively lyses MUC16+, but not MUC16−, cells than compared to 3a5-28z or truncMSLN-28z CAR T cells. Ablation of MUC16 by CRISPR/Cas9 or modification of MSLN-based CAR to lack signaling domains abolishes the cytotoxicity of MSLN-28z CAR T cells, demonstrating dependency on MUC16 engagement. Using multiplex assays and intracellular cytokine staining, we further demonstrate MSLN-28z CAR T cells have potent polyfunctionality through secretion of cytokines IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF-a by both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Last, in immunodeficient mice orthotopically xenografted with HT1376 cells, intravesical delivery of MSLN-28z CAR T cells enhances survival compared to CAR T cells delivered intravenously. This enhanced anti-tumor response correlates with reduced tumor weights and increased T cell infiltration. Notably, intravesically delivered CAR T cells are not detectable in peripheral circulation of tumor-bearing mice. Together, our findings substantiate MUC16 as a targetable antigen in BC and validate MSLN-based CAR T cells as a potential intravesical therapy.

        <tr id="One of the major challenges in the choice of the best therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients affected by hemophilia A (HA) is the definition of criteria predicting the formation of factor VIII (FVIII) neutralizing antibodies, called inhibitors. Both genetic and environmental elements influencing the immune response toward FVIII have been identified but still not all the factors causing the pathological rejection of FVIII have been identified. Since there is a connection between coagulation and inflammation, here we assessed the role played by the FVIII deficiency in shaping the humoral and cellular response toward an antigen other than FVIII itself. To this aim, we challenged both HA and wild-type (WT) mice with either FVIII or ovalbumin (OVA) and followed antigen-specific antibody level, immune cell population frequency and phenotype up to 9 weeks after the last antigen booster. The activation threshold was evaluated in vitro by stimulating the murine T cells with a decreasing dose of α-CD3. The humoral response to FVIII was similar between the two groups while both the in vivo and in vitro experiments highlighted an antigen-independent sensitivity of HA compared with WT T cells causing an increase in memory T-cell conversion and proliferation capability.">

Leveraging the unique properties of T cells, chimeric antigen receptor-T cells and T cell receptor (TCR)-T cells were developed through genetic modification of their receptors, enhancing the specificity and effectiveness of T cell therapy. Adoptive cell transfer of chimeric antigen receptor-T cells has been successful for the treatment of hematological malignancies. To expand T cell therapy to solid tumors, T cells are modified to express defined TCR targeting tumor associated antigen, which is called TCR-T therapy. This review discusses anti-tumor T cell therapies, with a focus on engineered TCR-T cell therapy.

 Although CAR-T19 therapy is widely used for relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, approximately half of patients experience post CAR-T relapse. The mechanisms underlying this resistance remain largely unknown and efforts to overcome this limitation are hindered by the lack of suitable pre-clinical models for study. To address these unmet needs, we generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model with conditional expression of Ezh2Y641F and BCL2 in germinal center (GC) B cells. Ezh2/BCL2 mice developed follicular lymphoma (FL) which histologically and transcriptionally recapitulates human FL. Moreover, we established a cell line derived from an Ezh2/BCL2 mouse that developed transformed FL (tFL). Injection of the cell line named “tFL-P6” in immunocompetent C57BL6 recipients resulted in rapid disease progression that histologically and transcriptionally mimics human tFL. Treatment of tFL-P6 with EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) didn’t affect proliferation and viability, however, the number of pretreated cells was significantly reduced when co-cultured with T cells. EZH2i pretreated tFL-P6 displayed extended interaction with T cells, as measured by live imaging. EZH2i reprogrammed tFL-P6 to restore T cell engagement genes such as ICOSL, ICAM1, OX40L, and integrins, as well as cytokines and chemokines involved in T cell recruitment, therefore enhancing immunogenicity. Notably, pretreated tFL-P6 cells were rejected by C57BL6 whereas they developed lethal disease in immunodeficient recipients. Pre-treatment of tFL-P6 as well as human DLBCL and PDX-derived cell lines significantly enhanced CAR-T19 cell killing effects in vitro. Administering CAR-T cells in mice engrafted with EZH2i-pretreated tFL-P6 significantly reduced the tumor burden and prolonged their survival (100% vs 30%, p<0.01). To assess the direct interactions between lymphoma cells and CAR-T cells in vivo, we performed intravital 2-photon imaging of popliteal lymph nodes using dTomato labeled CAR-T cells and GFP+ tFL-P6 cells. Pretreatment of tFL-P6 cells with EZH2i doubled the recruitment of CAR-T cells in the microenvironment and enhanced the duration of contact and surface engagement with CAR-T cells. To explore the impact of EZH2 inhibition on CAR-T cells, we manufactured CAR-T cells from splenic T cells of mice treated with EZH2i or vehicle for 14 days. Prior exposure to EZH2i didn’t affect proliferation and transduction during CAR-T production. Ex vivo assays with those CAR-T cells and tFL-P6 cells showed a superior killing effect and expansion of EZH2i-exposed CAR-T (p<0.001). Mice bearing tFL-P6 lymphomas displayed a longer survival when infused with EZH2i-pretreated CAR-T cells (p=0.06). Pretreatment with EZH2i resulted in an increased memory/effector ratio (p<0.01) and reduction of PD1+CD38+ exhausted CD8CAR-T cells (p<0.001). Overall, EZH2i improved CAR-T therapy by enhancing lymphoma cell immunogenicity and CAR-T cell functions. These results prompted the initiation of a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in R/R B cell lymphomas (NCT05934838).

        <tr id="Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that play important roles in maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating immune responses. MDSCs can be divided into two main subsets based on their surface markers and functional properties: granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) and monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs). Recently greatest attention has been paid to innate immunity in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), so the aim of our review is to provide an overview of the main characteristics of MDSCs in MS and its preclinical model by discussing the most recent data available. The immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs can be dysregulated in MS, leading to an exacerbation of the autoimmune response and disease progression. Antigen-specific peptide immunotherapy, which aims to restore tolerance while avoiding the use of non-specific immunosuppressive drugs, is a promising approach for autoimmune diseases, but the cellular mechanisms behind successful therapy remain poorly understood. Therefore, targeting MDSCs could be a promising therapeutic approach for MS. Various strategies for modulating MDSCs have been investigated, including the use of pharmacological agents, biological agents, and adoptive transfer of exogenous MDSCs. However, it remained unclear whether MDSCs display any therapeutic potential in MS and how this therapy could modulate different aspects of the disease. Collectively, all the described studies revealed a pivotal role for MDSCs in the regulation of MS..">

        <tr id="Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has become a treatment option for otherwise non-curative conditions, both malignant and benign, affecting children and adults. Nevertheless, the latest research has been focusing extensively on transplantation from related and unrelated haploidentical donors, suitable for patients requiring emergent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the absence of an HLA-matched donor. Haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) can be an effective treatment for non-malignant pediatric disorders, such as primary immunodeficiencies or hemoglobinopathies, by enabling a much quicker selection of the appropriate donor for virtually all patients, low incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and transplant-related mortality (TRM). Moreover, the outcomes of haplo-HSCT among children with hematological malignancies have improved radically. The most demanding tasks for clinicians are minimizing T-cell-mediated alloreactivity as well as early GVHD prevention. As a result, several T-cell depletion approaches, such as ex vivo T-cell depletion (TCD), and T-cell replete approaches, such as a combination of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), cyclosporine/tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate, have been taken up. As more research is needed to establish the most beneficial form of therapy, haplo-HSCT is currently considered an alternative donor strategy for pediatric and adult patients with complications like viral and bacterial infections, invasive fungal disease, and GVHD.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Eftilagimod alpha (efti), a soluble LAG-3 protein, activates antigen-presenting cells (APC) and downstream T-cells. TACTI-002 (Part C) evaluated whether combining efti with pembrolizumab led to strong anti-tumor responses in 2nd line recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) patients, while demonstrating good tolerability.


METHODS
In this multinational phase 2 trial using Simon's 2-stage design, R/M HNSCC PD-L(1)-naïve patients who had failed first-line platinum-based therapy, unselected for PD-L1, received intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg, Q3W) combined with subcutaneous efti (30 mg Q2W for 24 weeks and Q3W thereafter). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per iRECIST by investigator assessment. Additional endpoints included duration of response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and tolerability. Pharmacodynamic effects (absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] and Th1 cytokine biomarkers [IFN-gamma/CXCL-10]) were evaluated in liquid biopsies.


RESULTS
Between Mar 2019 - Jan 2021, 39 patients were enrolled; 37 were evaluated for response. All patients received prior chemotherapy and 40.5% were pretreated with cetuximab. 53.1% of patients had PD-L1 CPS <20. With a median follow up of 38.8 months, ORR was 29.7%, including 13.5% complete responders. Median DoR was not reached. Rapid and sustained ALC increase was observed in patients who had an objective response. Th1 biomarkers increased sustainably after first treatment. No unexpected safety signals were observed.


CONCLUSION
Efti plus pembrolizumab was safe and showed encouraging antitumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects in 2nd line HNSCC patients, thus supporting further evaluation of this combination in earlier treatment lines.">

        <tr id="Although adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has achieved unprecedented response rates in patients with certain hematological malignancies, this therapeutic modality is still far from fulfilling its remarkable potential, especially in the context of solid cancers. Antigen escape variants, off-tumor destruction of healthy tissues expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), poor CAR-T cell persistence, and the occurrence of functional exhaustion represent some of the most prominent hurdles that limit CAR-T cell ability to induce long-lasting remissions with a tolerable adverse effect profile. In this review, we summarize the main approaches that have been developed to face such bottlenecks, including the adapter CAR (AdCAR) system, Boolean-logic gating, epitope editing, the modulation of cell-intrinsic signaling pathways, and the incorporation of safety switches to precisely control CAR-T cell activation. We also discuss the most pressing issues pertaining to the selection of co-stimulatory domains, with a focus on strategies aimed at promoting CAR-T cell persistence and optimal antitumor functionality.">

        <tr id="8527 Background: Despite the vast amount of T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data generated from patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI), the clinical insights gained from interrogating antigen-specific T cell responses have been limited. Napsin A is a self-antigen normally expressed in lung parenchyma and highly expressed as a cancer antigen in lung adenocarcinoma. A prior study demonstrated enrichment of Napsin A-specific clonotypes within lung tumors and increased frequency of Napsin A-specific CD8+ IFNγ+ cells among patients with response to ICI (Berner et al 2022 Science Immunol). This finding suggests that T cell responses against Napsin A may be relevant to ICI-mediated anti-tumor responses and might offer a mechanistic link between tumor control and immune adverse events involving the lungs. We examined this hypothesis utilizing TCR repertoire data and assessed whether Napsin A-specific clonotypes are more abundant in the blood of patients with durable clinical benefit to ICI compared to patients with progressive disease. Methods: Patients with metastatic NSCLC receiving anti-PD-1 (alone or in combination, 1st-4th line) were enrolled at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and Stanford University Medical Center (n = 61; histology of adenocarcinoma n = 48, squamous n = 9, NSCLC/other n = 4). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected for genomic DNA isolation at pre- and post-treatment (range 3 weeks - 3 months, single post-treatment sample per patient). TCRß was sequenced at survey and deep level via the immunoSEQ platform (Adaptive Biotechnologies). Publicly available TCRß sequences specific for Napsin A (n= 42) were obtained from Berner et al. The frequency of Napsin-A specific TCRß sequences were quantified in each patient sample. Patient demographics, durable clinical benefit (DCB) at 6 months (DCB n = 30, progressive disease n = 31), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were captured from chart review. High versus low frequency of Napsin A-specific TCRs were defined as above/below the median for PFS and OS analysis. Results: Napsin A-specific clonotypes were significantly enriched within 3 months after treatment in patients achieving DCB from ICI compared to patients without DCB (p = 0.037 post-treatment, n = 41). Patients with a higher frequency of Napsin A-specific TCRs had a significant improvement in OS compared to patients with a lower frequency of these clonotypes (p = 0.006 pre-treatment; p = 0.016 post-treatment). Conclusions: A higher frequency of Napsin A-specific T cell clonotypes is associated with DCB and improved OS with ICI in patients with NSCLC. T cell immune responses recognizing the tumor antigen Napsin A may play a role in shaping ICI responses, a finding that warrants further investigation in larger datasets.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell therapy represents a promising advancement in the field of oncology offering a novel approach to target and eliminate tumor cells with high specificity and reduced risk of immune-related adverse effects. This paper reviews the mechanism, potential targets, and recent advances in CAR-NK cell therapy for lung cancer, including the design and engineering of CAR-NK cells, preclinical studies, and the outcomes of early-phase clinical trials. We highlight the unique advantages of using NK cells, such as their innate ability to recognize and kill cancer cells and their reduced potential for inducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) compared to CAR T-cell therapies. Results from recent studies demonstrate significant antitumor activity in lung cancer models with improved targeting and persistence of CAR-NK cells observed in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we discuss the challenges in optimizing CAR-NK cell therapies, including the potential resistance mechanisms. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future directions of CAR-NK cell research and its implications for lung cancer treatment emphasizing the importance of continued innovation and collaboration in the field.">

        <tr id="TPS6117 Background: Single agent pembrolizumab in relapsed / metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) has an estimated ORR of 19% and median OS of 13.6 months. There are several factors which may influence which patients respond to antibodies targeting the PD-1 axis. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a significant role in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Anti-PD-1 antibodies induce Treg activation in part through AKT pathway activation, which may contribute to low response rates to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. AKT blockade selectively inhibits the proliferation of human Tregs. Additionally, inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway limits myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) infiltration and differentiation, and boosts CD8+ T cell memory and effector function. Ipatasertib is an oral highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of all three isoforms of AKT. This phase 2 trial is designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in first line R/M, HNSCC patients treated with the combination ipatasertib and pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy treatment. Methods: In this open-label randomized phase 2 multicenter trial, patients with R/M HNSCC are treated with pembrolizumab 200mg on day 1 +/- ipatasertib 400mg QD days 1-14 of 21-day cycles. Patients must have PD-L1 CPS score ³ 1, have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, and consent to on-treatment biopsy. Patients will be excluded if they have received prior systemic therapy for R/M HNSCC, cannot swallow a pill, or require insulin for diabetes. The primary objective is to compare the PFS between the two arms. We will estimate the relative hazard ratio associated with ipatasertib plus pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab alone using the Cox Model where randomized treatment assignment is the only variable in the model. Secondary objectives include ORR, safety and tolerability of the combination, and changes in tumor immune cell infiltration, AKT signaling, and changes in peripheral blood immune cells. Ultimately, a total of 48 patients will be enrolled, with 24 patients in each cohort. To date, a total of 22 patients have been enrolled from 15 sites. Accrual is ongoing (NCT05172258).

        <tr id="e14512 Background: Recent findings have demonstrated neutrophils play a key role in tumour control and in facilitating successful responses to cancer immunotherapy. At LIfT Biosciences we have developed the first-in-class, allogeneic, off-the-shelf, stem cell-derived immuno-cell therapy with anti-cancer neutrophil properties. Immunomodulatory Alpha Neutrophils (IMANs) exert their anti-cancer activity via multiple direct and indirect mechanisms, ensuring direct antigen-independent tumour cell killing, as well as impacting anti-cancer function of other direct acting cells such as NK and gamma delta T cells, and further immunomodulation of the environment to boost adaptive immune responses ensuring maximal T cell activity can be achieved. IMANs have the potential to provide major clinical benefits in the treatment of multiple solid tumours. Methods: We present a patent-pending, GMP-compliant manufacturing process starting with CD34+ cells isolated from mobilized peripheral blood of healthy donors. Extensive characterisation of starting material in combination with in-process and raw material controls results in a simple, consistent, scalable manufacturing process using known and established manufacturing platforms. IMANs are granulopoietic myeloid progenitors derived from the expansion of CD34+ cells followed by differentiation in proprietary media compositions, composed of critical priming agents which are known to promote anti-cancer neutrophil phenotype and function. Neutrophil functional heterogeneity is becoming increasingly appreciated and we have designed our manufacturing process to produce activated, committed, persistent IMANs with multimodal mechanisms of action. IMANs are composed of distinct neutrophil progenitor populations. IMANs are cytotoxic towards numerous solid tumour cell lines, expressing tumour-ablating Neutrophil elastase. Furthermore, IMANs exert immunomodulatory properties through cytokine and chemokine secretion, and expression of ligands for T and NK cell co-stimulatory receptors. Results: The manufacturing process has been optimised with vast expansion capacity, showing up to 1000-fold increase from starting cell populations and efficient cryopreservation with exceptional post-thaw recovery. Conclusions: Cryopreserved IMANs offer a cost-effective and globally accessible cell therapy with the potential for long term clinical benefit.">

        <tr id="Background Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is a significant concern following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. While previous research has highlighted the anti-CMV reactivation effect of γδ T cells in immunocompromised transplant patients, their characterization in recipients at high risk of CMV reactivation remains limited. Methods This study focused on D+/R+ recipients (where both donor and recipient are CMV seropositive) at high risk of CMV reactivation. We analyzed 28 patients who experienced CMV recurrence within 100 days post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, along with 36 matched recipients who did not experience CMV recurrence. Clinical data from both groups were compared, and risk factors for CMV reactivation were identified. Additionally, CMV viral load was measured, and flow cytometric analysis was conducted to assess changes in peripheral blood γδ T cell proportions, subpopulation distribution, and differentiation status. We also analyzed the CDR3 repertoire of the TCR δ chain in different γδ T cell subsets. Functional analysis was performed by measuring the lysis of CMV-infected cells upon stimulation. Results CMV reactivation post-transplantation was associated with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) and reactivation of non-CMV herpesviruses. Notably, CMV reactivation led to sustained expansion of γδ T cells, primarily within the Vδ2neg γδ T cell subpopulation, with a trend toward differentiation from Naive to effector memory cells. Analysis of the δ chain CDR3 repertoire revealed a delay in the reconstitution of clonal diversity in Vδ2neg γδ T cells following CMV reactivation, while Vδ2pos T cells remained unaffected. Upon stimulation with CMV-infected MRC5 cells, the Vδ2neg γδ T cell subpopulation emerged as the primary effector cell group producing IFN-γ and capable of lysing CMV-infected cells. Moreover, our findings suggest that NKG2D is not necessary involved in Vδ2neg γδ T cell-mediated anti-CMV cytotoxicity. Conclusion This study provides novel insights into the role of γδ T cells in the immune response to CMV reactivation in transplantation recipients at high risk of CMV infection. Specifically, the Vδ2neg γδ T cell subpopulation appears to be closely associated with CMV reactivation, underscoring their potential role in controlling infection and reflecting CMV reactivation in HSCT patients.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy has been a popular treatment for tumors in recent years, and it has good efficacy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially B-lymphoblastic ALL. Generally, CAR-T therapy affects the tumor immune microenvironment and activates the immune response, so it may lead to the occurrence of inflammation and some other adverse effects, most of which are self-limiting symptoms. However, a small number of children will develop severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening in severe cases. Currently, the main means of treating or alleviating CRS is the application of monoclonal antibodies, glucocorticosteroids, boosting drugs, etc. Although these drugs can relieve symptoms, further effects need to be further discussed. The mechanism of CAR-T causing ALL is described in this paper, and the mechanism, advantages and disadvantages of various drugs, and their impact on tumor treatment are compared to analyze the better measures to deal with CRS, so as to provide ideas for further clinical practice.">

        <tr id="7043 Background: Combination trials of BTK inhibitors (BTKi) with CAR-T have suggested potential synergistic benefit by improving CAR-T immunophenotype and clinical outcomes but are limited by increased toxicity. We report immunophenotype, cytokine profile, and patient outcomes with the new non-covalent BTKi, pirtobrutinib (pirto) when given prior to LV20.19 CAR-T and compare the final CAR product to pts who did not receive pirtobrutinib prior to CAR. Methods: Pts received LV20.19 CAR-T as part of a phase 1/2 trial (NCT04186520). Only pts who received pirto £4 weeks prior to apheresis were included. To determine the impact of pirto on LV20.19 CAR-T, we calculated both polyfunctionality (PFA) and polyfunctional strength index (PSI) for each product using the Isoplexis. Descriptive statistics, t-tests and Kaplan-Meier method were used as appropriate. Results: 11 pts received pirto prior to LV20.19 CAR-T (Table). Median age was 65 (50-80) yrs and median prior lines of therapy were 4 (2-8). There were 4 MCL pts, 5 Richter’s (RT)/CLL, 1 MZL and 1 DLBCL. Median duration of pirto was 4 (1-20) mo. Pts were on pirto for a median of 12 (1-22) days prior to apheresis. All except 1 pts received target CAR-T dose. The day 28 ORR was 82% (CR=7, PR=2). After a median follow up of 13 mo, 3 pts died (PD, Covid, Guillain Barre). The median PFS and OS were both 30.8 mo while the 1-year PFS and OS rates were 9 and 15 mo respectively. 9 pts had CRS and 2 had ICANS, all grades 1-2, while 4 had IEC-HS. One pt had afib recurrence and 1 pt had CMV viremia within 30 days of CAR-T. Among the pts with immunophenotypic data (n=10), there were no differences in naïve or more differentiated T-cell percentages in apheresis and final CAR-T products when compared to pts who did not receive pirto before LV20.19 CAR-T (n=57). Although not statistically significant, both PFA (CD4=61.8 vs 59, CD8= 49.8 vs 46.9) and PSI (CD4= 1752 vs 1608, CD8=1299 vs 1079) were higher with pirto pre-treated pts, suggesting a potential trend towards improved CAR-T functionality. Conclusions: These data represent the largest experience of pirto prior to CAR-T apheresis and demonstrate that pirto can be safely used as a bridge to LV20.19 CAR-T without negatively impacting their immunophenotype and potentially improving functionality.

        <tr id="177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan (Betalutin) is an anti-CD37 radioimmunoconjugate evaluated as single administration therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan treatment is well-tolerated and shows consistent activity in most of the patients evaluated so far. Herein, we investigated the activity of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan in a panel of 55 lymphoma cell lines of B and T cell origin. CD37-targeted radioimmunotherapy was more effective in CD37-positive B-cell lymphomas (n=46) than negative CD37 negative T-cell lymphomas (n=9). Focusing on DLBCL cell lines, mutations such as BCL2 or MYC translocations were not correlated to sensitivity. However, BCL2 expression was higher in resistant than sensitive GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and the addition of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax showed synergism when added to the radioimmunoconjugate. Finally, the pattern of activity of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan differed from what was achieved with a CD37-targeting antibody-drug conjugate or with R-CHOP, indicating the potential benefit of the beta-emitter payload. In conclusion, this systematic analysis of the responsiveness of lymphoma cell lines to CD37-targeting radioimmunotherapy consolidated 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan as a promising compound for the treatment of CD37 positive malignancies and identified candidate biomarkers and co-targets to detect and overcome cancer cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in treating advanced B-cell malignancies by targeting CD19, but antigen-negative relapses and immune responses triggered by murine-derived antibodies remain significant challenges, necessitating the development of novel humanized multitarget CAR-T therapies. Here, we engineered a second-generation 4-1BB-CD3ζ-based CAR construct incorporating humanized CD19 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and BAFFR single-variable domains on heavy chains (VHHs), also known as nanobodies. The resultant CAR-T cells, with different constructs, were functionally compared both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the optimal tandem and bicistronic (BI) structures retained respective antigen-binding abilities, and both demonstrated specific activation when stimulated with target cells. At the same time, BI CAR-T cells (BI CARs) exhibited stronger tumour-killing ability and better secretion of interleukin-2 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha than single-target CAR-T cells. Additionally, BI CARs showed less exhaustion phenotype upon repeated antigen stimulation and demonstrated more potent and persistent antitumor effects in mouse xenograft models. Overall, we developed a novel humanized CD19/BAFFR bicistronic CAR (BI CAR) based on a combination of scFv and VHH, which showed potent and sustained antitumor ability both in vitro and in vivo, including against tumours with CD19 or BAFFR deficiencies.">

In recent times, chimeric receptor antigen T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy has shown efficacy and promise in the immunotherapy of cancers, presenting a significant advancement in blood cancer treatment. However, despite its effectiveness in treating B-cell lymphoma, challenges persist with response variability, resistance, and adverse effects. This review focuses on recent advances and current challenges, limitations, and the related preclinical and clinical findings of cancer immunotherapy as well as solutions for increasing the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy. Ongoing research focuses on exploring molecular and cellular processes post-infusion, developing "universal CAR-T lymphocytes" sourced from healthy donors as well as exploring alternative candidates like CAR-armored NK cells and CAR-NKT cells, which show promise due to their potent anti-tumour properties and diverse cytotoxic capabilities. The interplay of genetics with the immune system undoubtedly holds the potential for developing innovative treatments that could revolutionize cancer therapy in the future.">

        <tr id="2650 Background: REGN6569 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is highly specific for glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor–related protein (GITR). GITR is expressed on several immune cell subtypes, notably regulatory T cells (Tregs), and activated natural killer (NK) cells. REGN6569 demonstrated greater in vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against GITR-expressing Tregs, as compared to GITR-expressing CD8+ T cells. Mouse studies showed that REGN6569 + cemiplimab (anti-PD-1) combination treatment achieved longer-term tumor responses compared with either drug alone. Methods: This is a first-in-human study (NCT04465487) evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of REGN6569 administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) + cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W, in pts with advanced solid tumors for which immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have not been approved or are not available. The study includes a dose-escalation part with 5 dose levels (DL1-DL5) for REGN6569 (“4+3” design), with an initial dose of REGN6569 monotherapy given as a safety lead-in followed by REGN6569 + cemiplimab in subsequent doses. Results: As of the data cutoff date Oct 20, 2023, the dose-escalation part has been completed. 29 pts (median age 58.0 years, 62.1% male) were treated with REGN6569 + cemiplimab, up to the 1200 mg dose level (DL5), across many solid tumor types. The most common tumor type was colorectal cancer (34.5%). One pt (40 mg DL2) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (Grade 3 hepatic failure); maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Twelve pts (41.4%) had a Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 16 pts (55.2%) had a treatment-related TEAE (any grade). The most frequent TEAEs (any grade) were arthralgia (24.1%), infusion-related reactions, and abdominal pain (20.7% each). There were no treatment-related deaths; 19 (65.5%) pts had disease progression leading to death. Two pts achieved ongoing partial responses by investigator assessment with REGN6569 + cemiplimab treatment: 1 pt with mucoepidermoid tumor of the parotid gland treated with 120 mg (DL3) REGN6569 and 1 pt with B3 thymoma treated with 400 mg (DL4) REGN6569, with duration of responses, 5.6 and 10.4 months, respectively. Full receptor occupancy on circulating Tregs was observed in all dose cohorts following REGN6569 treatment. Increased frequency (~10–50%) of proliferating NK cells in peripheral blood was observed post REGN6569 treatment across all dose cohorts. Conclusions: In this dose-escalation study, REGN6569 was administered up to 1200 mg (DL5) in combination with cemiplimab with one dose-limiting toxicity. The study has progressed to dose-expansion cohorts in anti–PD-1-resistant head and neck cancer, with pts treated with REGN6569 (DL5) + cemiplimab. Clinical trial information: NCT04465487 .">

        <tr id="TPS9602 Background: Current standard of care in newly diagnosed patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM) include anti-PD1 as monotherapy or in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, most patients will eventually progress and the 5-year survival rate remains low, necessitating new therapies with novel mechanisms of action to combine with anti-PD1. T cell receptor (TCR) bispecifics have shown overall survival (OS) benefit with tebentafusp (gp100 ´ CD3) in a phase (Ph) 3 trial in metastatic uveal melanoma [1]. IMC-F106C is the first TCR bispecific protein targeting CD3 and PRAME (PRAME ´ CD3), redirecting T cells towards cancer cells presenting a PRAME peptide on the cell surface by HLA-A*02:01 proteins. PRAME is expressed in the vast majority of melanoma. In an ongoing Ph 1 study (NCT04262466), IMC-F106C monotherapy was well tolerated and demonstrated evidence of durable clinical activity in heavily pre-treated, advanced melanoma patients, including those who progressed on prior ICI and targeted therapy [2]. Two doses, 40 mcg and 160 mcg, were selected for further study based on exposure response modeling. Safety of combination TCR bispecifics with ICI has been demonstrated in the ongoing IMC-F106C Ph 1 study and in a prior study of tebentafusp + ICI [3]. Combining IMC-F106C with the anti-PD1 ICI nivolumab has the potential to improve progression free survival (PFS), OS, and response rate (RR). Methods: PRISM-MEL-301 is a randomized, global, open-label, Ph 3 study in previously untreated HLA-A*02:01+ patients with unresectable or metastatic non-uveal melanoma; up to 10% of patients can have a diagnosis of mucosal, acral, or other non-CM melanoma. The first 90 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive IMC-F106C 40 mcg + nivolumab (Arm A), IMC-F106C 160 mcg + nivolumab (Arm B), or a nivolumab regimen (Arm C) from which a final IMC-F106C dose (Arm A or B) will be selected. Subsequently, approximately 590 additional patients will be randomized to Arm (A or B) vs. control Arm C, either nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab + relatlimab, dependent on the country. Randomization will be stratified by 1) American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th Edition) M stage with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; M0 or M1 with normal LDH vs M1 with elevated LDH); 2) prior anti-PD[L]1 adjuvant therapy (yes vs no); and 3) BRAF V600 mutation status (positive vs negative). Primary endpoint is PFS per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include OS, ORR, and safety. Enrollment is ongoing globally.

        <tr id="TPS7083 Background: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a key component of the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD 11)-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL 10)-MALT1 signalosome complex, which activates nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling in response to B-cell–receptor or T-cell–receptor stimulation. Activation of NF-κB signaling promotes survival and proliferation of B-cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. ONO-7018 is an oral, potent, and selective MALT1 inhibitor that has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in several lymphoma models (Morishita D, et al. Blood. 2020). Therefore, ONO-7018 has therapeutic potential for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of ONO-7018 as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL or CLL. Methods: This Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study will be done in two parts, a dose-escalation phase (part 1) and a dose-expansion phase (part 2). An estimated 54 eligible patients will be enrolled. Patients must be adults with relapsed/refractory NHL or CLL with measurable disease; all acute toxic effects of prior antitumor therapy should be grade ≤1; have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2; and have adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. Exclusion criteria include history of other lymphoid malignancy, central nervous system involvement, active autoimmune disease, systemic and active infection, serious or uncontrolled medical disorder, and patient inability to swallow tablets. ONO-7018 will be administered orally. In part 1, patients will be assigned to a dose level cohort (≤4 dose levels: DL1-DL4) using a 3+3 dose-escalation design. In part 2, patients will be given the recommended dose level from part 1, following safety review. The primary endpoints include dose-limiting toxicity, MTD, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The study began February 13, 2023, and is currently recruiting; part 1 is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT05515406 .">

        <tr id="7004 Background: A substantial proportion of patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) will not derive a long-term benefit from the existing anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. To enhance therapeutic efficacy, we have engineered huCART19-IL18, a 4th generation 4-1BB anti-CD19 construct, armored with the ability to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-18. Methods: This is a first-in-human trial using huCART19-IL18 for CD19+ B-cell malignancies (NCT04684563). Expedited 3-day manufacturing is utilized to limit T-cell exhaustion. To be eligible for the NHL cohort, pts must be R/R to prior anti-CD19 CAR T cells if indicated by FDA label. Dose levels (DL) between 3x106 and 3x108 of huCART19-IL18+ cells are administered as a single IV infusion following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Bridging therapy is optional. Responses are first assessed at 3 months (mo) using Lugano criteria. Results: As of January 20, 2024, 21 pts with CD19+ NHL were infused with huCART19-IL18. Characteristics include median age 64 yrs (47-74), 76% male, 9 (43%) DLBCL, 6 (29%) FL, 3 (14%) MCL, 2 (10%) tFL, 1 (5%) HGBCL. Median number of prior Rx was 7 (4-14) with 20 (95%) pts R/R to prior anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Manufacturing of DL5 (3x108) was not feasible due to inability to achieve the target dose in 4/6 (67%) pts assigned to DL5. 18 (86%) pts received bridging. 3 pts received DL1 (3x106), 4 pts DL2 (7x106), 1 pt non-defined dose (2.8x107), 6 pts DL3 (3x107), 5 pts DL4 (7x107), 2 pts DL5 (3x108). No study-related deaths occurred in 21 safety-evaluable pts. CRS occurred in 15 (71%) pts: G1 in 8 (38%), G2 in 4 (19%), G3 in 3 (14%). ICANS occurred in 3 (14%) pts: G1 in 2 (10%), G2 in 1 (5%). The most common G3 adverse events at least possibly related to huCART19-IL18 included fatigue (38%), hypotension (29%), and low fibrinogen (23%). 20 pts are efficacy evaluable with median (m) follow-up of 15 mo (3-31). The 3 mo ORR was 80% (90% CI: 60-93%), with CR 50% (90% CI: 30-70%) and PR 30% (90% CI: 14-51%). mDOR was 10 mo (5.5-NR). mPFS was 8.7 mo (90% CI 5-NR), and mOS was NR (90% CI 25 mo-NR). We detected continued persistence of huCART19-IL18 in pts with 24 mo follow-up. No correlation between cell dose and outcome was identified, but response rates and mean expansion (copies/µg gDNA) were higher in pts previously exposed to CD28 CAR than those who had prior 4-1BB CAR (Table). Conclusions: Treatment with huCART19-IL18 has an acceptable safety profile and produced durable remissions in heavily pre-treated pts with R/R NHL despite prior CAR T-cell therapy. The subtype of the preceding CAR product may influence the expansion and effectiveness of huCART19-IL18. Clinical trial information: NCT04684563 . [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="e19537 Background: Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) is a benign precursor of multiple myeloma (MM). Individuals with MGUS have an overall 1% risk per year of disease progression to active MM or other cancers, although risk varies depending on multiple factors. Natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and dendritic cells have been shown to be altered in MM. Immune profile analysis can help to understand the microenvironment for monoclonal plasma cells better and help identify early factors for progression of MGUS into MM. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of individuals from 2007-2023 who had a confirmed MGUS diagnosis and available flow-cytometry based immunophenotyping of peripheral blood. Demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), immunoglobulin subtype, date of diagnosis and progression, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, CD19+ B-cells, memory B-cells, gamma delta T cells, NK cells, and exhausted/non-exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were characterized. Descriptive statistics were expressed as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and tabulated frequencies for categorical variables. Pearson’s chi-square test of independence was used to explore the relationship between categorical race and diagnosis across categorical variables. Analysis of variance was utilized to assess the variation in continuous variables by race and diagnosis. The investigation of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) involved using univariate and multivariate Cox models across all pertinent variables. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated. A stepwise regression model was incorporated into the Cox multivariate model for a comprehensive analysis. All statistical tests were tested at alpha=0.05. Results: This retrospective study analyzed 151 patients, 84 (55.6%) being male. Average age was 55-77.8 years. The primary sub-diagnosis included IgG kappa at 30.5%, followed by IgG lambda at 29.8%. No significant associations were observed between MGUS subtype and comorbidities, race and Immunoglobulin subtype, Mayo risk status, and free light chain ratio (FLCR). After median follow-up of 666 days, median PFS was 8.07 years with a 95% CI of (4.45, 14.68), and median OS exceeded 12.71 years. The Univariate model for PFS identified the CCI Score (p=0.003, HR=1.25), FLCR (p=0.012, HR=1.024), and NK T-cells (%gated) (p=0.0211, HR=1.033) as significant factors. Only the CCI score was retained in the multivariate stepwise model. Univariate model for OS revealed associations with CCI (p<0.001, HR=1.50), NK T-cells (%gated) (p=0.007, HR=1.05), monoclonal protein (p=0.008, HR=2.80), Non-exhausted T-cells-CD4 (% of CD4+) (p=0.013, HR=0.96), and age (p=0.023, HR=1.09). Conclusions: In this single-center retrospective review, only CCI remained prognostically significant in the multivariate model. CCI and NK T-cells were prognostically significant for OS in the univariate analysis.">

        <tr id="7026 Background: Liso-cel is an autologous, CD19-directed, 4-1BB CAR T cell product indicated for the treatment of adults with R/R LBCL. Liso-cel NCP is defined as any product wherein one or both of the CD8 or CD4 cell components did not meet ≥ 1 of the commercial release specifications but met EAP release criteria and was considered appropriate for infusion. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter EAP study of pts with R/R LBCL intended to receive commercial liso-cel but were treated with NCP due to manufacturing outcomes. Data from United States pts are reported here. The study comprised a pretreatment period for pt evaluation, a treatment period, which started at the first dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and continued through NCP administration at Day 1, and the posttreatment period, which followed pts up to 3 months after NCP administration for safety and disease status. Study objectives were safety (primary endpoint) and effectiveness by ORR and CR rate assessed by the treating physician per Lugano 2014 criteria (secondary endpoint). Due to the 3-month follow-up, duration of response, PFS, and OS analyses could not be estimated. Results: A total of 167 United States pts (third-line or later, n = 145; second line, n = 22) were included in the analysis set (data cutoff: 11/20/2023), which included pts who were infused and completed 3 months of follow-up (n = 134) or discontinued participation or died before 3 months (n = 33). Median (IQR) time from leukapheresis to NCP infusion was 50 d (44–58). Median age was 69 y (range, 29–87), 57% male, 42% diffuse LBCL (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, and 29% transformed DLBCL. The most frequent types of NCP (≥ 10 cases) were CD4 low T-cell lineage purity (n = 37 [22%]), CD4 low or high vector copy number (n = 31 [19%]), CD4 low transduction frequency (n = 24 [14%]), or CD8 high interferon-γ (n = 12 [7%]). Bridging therapy was reported in 31% of pts. In the total population (N = 167), cytokine release syndrome was reported in 42% of pts (1% grade ≥ 3), neurological events in 8% (4% grade ≥ 3), immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity in 2% (1% grade ≥ 3), prolonged cytopenia in 40% (grade ≥ 3 on or after Day 29), grade ≥ 3 infections in 14%, infusion-related reactions in 1% (grade ≥ 3), and second primary malignancy in 1% (none grade ≥ 3). Thirteen pts died because of: AEs (n = 6), disease progression (n = 5), or unknown reasons (n = 2). Of 118 efficacy-evaluable pts for best overall response in the first 3 months, ORR was 71% (95% CI, 62–79); 53% had a CR (95% CI, 43–62) and 19% had a PR (95% CI, 12–27). Conclusions: These data add to current clinical experience with liso-cel, show that pts with R/R LBCL can derive clinical benefit from receiving NCP without compromising safety, and provide important evidence to facilitate clinical decision-making.

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has emerged as a highly
effective treatment for hematological tumors. However, the associated adverse reaction, Cytokine
Release Syndrome (CRS), poses a significant challenge. While numerous studies have investigated
CRS biomarkers during CAR-T cell therapy, the ability to predict CRS risk prior to treatment initiation
remains a crucial yet underexplored aspect.



The primary purpose of this study was to address the issue of limited data, explore an alternative
approach using public data to identify predictive markers for CRS risk assessment from
RNA-Seq in pre-treatment patients data, and comprehend the inducible mechanisms underlying
CRS.



We integrated information from two public databases, the FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) for adverse reaction reports of CAR-T cell therapy and the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) for RNA-Seq data on corresponding hematological tumors. Candidate genes were screened
by correlation analysis between Reported Odds Ratio (ROR) values and RNA-Seq gene expression
levels, and then core factors were identified through stepwise analysis of pathway enrichment, cluster
analysis, and protein interactions.



Our analysis highlighted the correlation between CRS risk and pre-treatment T cell activation/
proliferation, identifying key genes (IFN-γ, IL1β, IL2, IL6, and IL10) as significant CRS indicators.



This study offers a unique perspective on predicting CRS risk before CAR-T cell therapy,
circumventing the challenges of scarce clinical data by leveraging analysis of public databases.
It elucidates the crucial role of T cell activation/proliferation dynamics in CRS. The analytical
methods and identified markers provide a reference for the research and clinical application of
CAR-T cell therapy.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy for hematological malignancies is a rapidly advancing field that has gained momentum in recent years, primarily encompassing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other modalities. However, its clinical efficacy remains limited, and drug resistance poses a significant challenge. Therefore, novel immunotherapeutic targets and agents need to be identified. Recently, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent RNA epitope modification, has emerged as a pivotal factor in various malignancies. Reportedly, m6A mutations influence the immunological microenvironment of hematological malignancies, leading to immune evasion and compromising the anti-tumor immune response in hematological malignancies. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the roles of the currently identified m6A modifications in various hematological malignancies, with a particular focus on their impact on the immune microenvironment. Additionally, we provide an overview of the research progress made in developing m6A-targeted drugs for hematological tumor therapy, to offer novel clinical insights.">

        <tr id="e14532 Background: The prognosis of patients with R/R AML is poor and treatment remains challenging. Human C-type lectin-like molecule 1(CLL1) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on AML but is absent on normal HSCs. Clinical studies have shown that autologous CLL-1 is a novel and promising target for the treatment of AML. But autologous CAR-T therapy has been complicated by long production time, high-cost and risks of manufacturing failure, and allogeneic CAR-T cells can overcome these hurdles. Methods: A novel non-gene-editing allogeneic CAR-T platform was developed on the base of intracellular retention of membrane proteins, and named ThisCART (This = TCR and/or HLA-I intracellular sequestered). CLL1-directed ThisCART cells are readily produced with a single lentiviral vector, encoding both a CLL1-targeting CAR and an anti-CD3 single chain antibody with the KDEL peptide fused to its C-termini. The surface expression of CAR and TCRαβ/CD3 was measured by flow cytometer. Specific tumor cytotoxicity was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the safety of donor derived ThisCART cells were tested in a xenogeneic GvHD model. Results: The manufacturing platform of CLL1 ThisCART was able to achieve over 150-folds of ex vivo CAR-T expansion in all batches, with the purity of products (CAR-positive/TCRαβ-negative) above 99%. In preclinical models, CLL1 ThisCART did not induce GvHD, and exhibited superior antitumor function compared to benchmark (WO2017091615A) and conventional CLL1 CAR-T cells. CLL1 ThisCART cells were readily produced to a quantity and quality supporting clinical investigation. Conclusions: CLL1 ThisCART cells based on intracellular retention of TCRαβ/CD3 complex demonstrated superior CLL1-dependent cytotoxicity and no xenogeneic GvHD in murine models. With streamlined single-vector-based production, enhanced CAR signaling and potent cytotoxicity and favored preclinical safety profile, CLL1 ThisCART warrant clinical investigation.">

Besides allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that continues to provide potentially curative treatment for otherwise challenging diagnoses, recent years have seen impressive progress in immunotherapies for leukemias and lymphomas with immune checkpoint blockade, bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and CAR T cell therapies. Despite their success, non-response, relapse, and immune toxicities remain frequent, thus prioritizing the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms and identifying predictive biomarkers. The increasing availability of single-cell genomic tools now provides a system’s immunology view to resolve the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immunotherapies at unprecedented resolution. Here, we review recent studies that leverage these technological advancements for tracking immune responses, the emergence of immune resistance, and toxicities.

        <tr id="Simple Summary For metastatic urothelial cancer (UC), platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy are used, with newer treatments like monoclonal antibodies (e.g., pembrolizumab) showing varied success. Traditional treatments often fail to provide long-term responses. Advances in molecular understanding of UC have led to targeted therapies, identifying six UC subclasses influencing treatment responses. Promising drugs include the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs represent a significant advancement in UC treatment, using monoclonal antibodies linked to cytotoxic agents to target cancer cells. UC is suitable for ADC therapy due to high antigen expression, enhancing efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. Despite immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC progresses rapidly with poor survival rates. Notable ADCs include enfortumab vedotin, effective alone and with pembrolizumab, and sacituzumab govitecan, showing effectiveness in studies. This review covers ADC mechanisms, mono- and combination therapies, resistance, and future perspectives, highlighting ADCs’ vital role in treating UC. Abstract Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been a significant advancement in cancer therapy, particularly for urothelial cancer (UC). These innovative treatments, originally developed for hematological malignancies, use target-specific monoclonal antibodies linked to potent cytotoxic agents. This rational drug design efficiently delivers cancer cell-killing agents to cells expressing specific surface proteins, which are abundant in UC owing to their high antigen expression. UC is an ideal candidate for ADC therapy, as it enhances on-target efficacy while mitigating systemic toxicity. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology and mechanisms of tumor progression in UC. However, despite the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors, advanced UC is characterized by rapid progression and poor survival rates. Targeted therapies that have been developed include the anti-nectin 4 ADC enfortumab vedotin and the fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib. Enfortumab vedotin has shown efficacy in prospective studies in patients with advanced UC, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The anti-Trop-2 ADC sacituzumab govitecan has also demonstrated effectiveness in single-armed studies. This review highlights the mechanism of action of ADCs, their application in mono- and combination therapies, primary mechanisms of resistance, and future perspectives for their clinical use in UC treatment. ADCs have proven to be an increasingly vital component of the therapeutic landscape for urothelial carcinoma, filling a gap in the treatment of this progressive disease.">

Nucleoside-modified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccines induce effective stimulation of T follicular helper (TFH) cells, leading to a robust germinal center B cell response. Side effects from the BNT162b2 vaccination, including significant lymphadenopathy, have been reported previously. Here, we present a case of angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (AITL), a rare, peripheral T-cell lymphoma with RHOA-G17v-mutated gene developing in a patient following BNT162B2 vaccine with a plausible explanation. A 60-year-old Asian female received her first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine in August 2021. Right after her vaccination, she developed right axillary lymphadenopathy. She received her second vaccine dose in September 2021. Thereafter, she developed lymph node (LN) enlargement in her neck and groin. She underwent left posterior cervical and left groin LN excisional biopsy in April 2022 due to persistent palpable lymphadenopathy. Biopsy results then demonstrated benign follicular hyperplasia. For progressive B symptoms, a right axillary LN biopsy was done, which demonstrated AITL, with molecular studies revealing mutation in TET-2, IDH-2, and RHOA-G17v genes. Progression of AITL following BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine is limited in literature. Our case demonstrates a plausible correlation between the diagnosis of AITL following mRNA vaccination due to the malignant transformation of the TFH cells in patients who have a predisposing mutation of RHOA-17v. Given the rarity of AITL and the heterogeneity of molecular findings, more studies are needed to establish such an association.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a form of adoptive cell therapy that has revolutionized the field of cancer immunotherapy. Owing to the unprecedented efficacy seen in the treatment of blood cancers, the FDA has now approved multiple CAR T cell products for the treatment of various hematologic malignancies. Despite the clinical success seen in hematologic malignancies, CAR T cell therapies have demonstrated only modest efficacy in the treatment of solid tumors. Thus, great efforts are underway to increase the treatment efficacy in solid tumors and further enhance the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, irrespective of advancements in efficacy, there are still unmet needs for patients receiving CAR T cell therapies. CAR T cell therapies carry significant risks of potentially fatal toxicities, and few of these toxicities were predicted in the animal models used to advance these therapies to the clinic. Therefore, significant advancements are needed to help reduce the incidence and severity of these toxicities to ultimately enhance patient safety and quality of life. This review will provide a brief overview of some of the major toxicities associated with CAR T cell therapies and will discuss the various engineering strategies used to mitigate such toxicities in preclinical models and clinical studies.">

        <tr id="Myelofibrosis (MF) is a rare BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of stem cells, with mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes. MF presents in primary and secondary forms, with common symptoms including splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Diagnostic criteria involve bone marrow examination and mutation studies. Current treatments are limited, with allogeneic stem cell transplant as the only curative option. Recent FDA approval of Momelotinib (MMB) offers new promise for MF patients with anemia. MMB, a JAK1/2 and ACVR1 inhibitor, effectively reduces spleen size, improves hemoglobin levels, and decreases transfusion dependency. The MOMENTUM trial compared MMB to danazol in JAK inhibitor-treated MF patients with anemia, showing MMB’s superior symptom relief and transfusion independence rates. Additionally, the SIMPLIFY-1 and SIMPLIFY-2 trials evaluated MMB in JAK inhibitor-naïve and experienced patients, respectively, confirming MMB’s non-inferiority to ruxolitinib in spleen volume reduction and highlighting its benefits in transfusion requirements. MMB’s unique dual inhibition mechanism addresses anemia by suppressing hepcidin production, thus enhancing erythropoiesis. These trials collectively suggest MMB as an effective treatment for MF, improving quality of life and offering a survival advantage for patients with anemia. Despite challenges, such as trial design limitations and adverse events, MMB represents a significant advancement in MF management, providing a new therapeutic option for a previously underserved patient population.">

        <tr id="This review provides a rationale for using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved antibody - drug conjugates (ADCs) for implementing as therapy in recurrent refractory germ cell tumors (rrGCTs) similar to their position in the treatment of other types of chemoresistant solid tumors. GCTs originate from germ cells, they most frequently develop in ovaries or in the testes, whilst being the most common type of malignancy in young men. GCTs are very sensitive to cisplatin - based chemotherapy, but therapeutic resistance occurs in considerable number of cases, which is associated with disease recurrence and poor patient prognosis. ADCs are a novel type of targeted antitumor agents that combine tumor antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies with chemically linked chemotherapeutic drug (payload) exerting a cytotoxic effect. Several FDA - approved ADCs use as targeting moieties the antigens that are also detected in the GCTs, offering a benefit of this type of the targeted therapy even for refractory relapsing TGCT patients unresponsive to standard chemotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract BACKGROUND Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are the most common malignant CNS tumor in infants. AT/RT patients have a 5-year overall survival rate of ~35% and high rates of relapse, emphasizing a dire need for new safe and effective therapies. These therapy-resistant tumors frequently overexpress cell surface molecule B7-H3 (CD276). CAR-NK cells have several advantages over CAR-T cells. NK cells can be obtained from healthy donors and produced as an “off-the-shelf” product. NK cells also have a lower risk of inflammatory toxicity and graft-versus-host disease compared to T-cells when transferred across the HLA barrier. METHODS We have designed a library of variable affinity B7-H3-targeted CARs, produced γ-retroviral vector, and used this for generation of B7-H3 CAR-NK cells. We verified B7-H3 expression in a panel of AT/RT cell lines, and further engineered firefly luciferase expressing AT/RT (CHLA06.ffLuc, BT12.ffLuc, BT37.ffLuc) as well as a CHLA06-derived B7-H3 knockout. We developed an orthotopic CHLA06.ffLuc xenograft model. We tested CAR-NK cell functionality using in vitro co-culture and cytotoxicity assays. In vivo study was performed in our xenograft with intratumoral delivery of CAR-NK cells. RESULTS B7-H3 targeted CAR-NK cells demonstrate target-specific cytotoxicity when compared to untransduced NK cells (36.8±12.5% vs. 72.4±24.2% at effector:target ratio of 1:1, n=3). CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of B7-H3 in target cells abolished the difference in CAR vs. no-CAR NK-mediated target killing. When delivered intracranially to CHLA-06 orthotopic xenograft bearing mice, B7-H3 CAR NK cells eliminate tumor cells and prolong survival, whereas unmodified NK cells did not (log-ranked median survival = 20 vs. 84 days, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Targeting AT/RTs with an anti-B7-H3 CAR-NK cell therapy may provide a safe and effective treatment for patients who have extremely limited therapeutic options. Direct intracranial injections of cell therapies into pediatric patients is currently being explored in clinical trials.">

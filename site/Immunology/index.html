        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally acquire immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting phenotypes, which may contribute to tumor resistance to immunotherapy. We previously showed that suppression of microRNA activity through genetic Dicer1 inactivation rewires TAM’s transcriptomes and prompts their immunostimulatory activation. This phenotypic switch enhanced recruitment and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and improved the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse cancer models. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole tumors grown in either wild-type mice or mice with macrophage-specific Dicer1 deletion. The analysis of multiple cell populations, including several discrete monocyte and macrophage subsets, indicated broad and convergent immunostimulatory programming of the tumor microenvironment, which was dependent on CTL-derived interferon-gamma (IFNγ), in mice with DICER-deficient macrophages. Intriguingly, dynamic inferences on monocyte/macrophage ontogeny and differentiation by pseudotime analysis revealed trajectories associated with progression into cell cycle, monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, and transition from an immunostimulatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors with DICER-proficient macrophages. Dicer1 deficiency interfered with this trajectory and stalled TAMs at an intermediate state between immature monocytes and macrophages with T cell-stimulatory capacity, thereby impeding immunosuppressive TAM development. This translated into enhanced response to antiangiogenic immunotherapy in an immunotherapy-resistant model of non-small cell lung cancer. Cycling/M2-like macrophages were conserved in human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and should represent a more promising therapeutic target than the bulk of TAMs.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic reinforcement of T cell exhaustion is known to be a major barrier limiting T cell responses during immunotherapy. However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients. Editor’s summary T cell immunotherapies have been successful in treating some intractable cancers, but there are limitations caused by the inability of T cells to persist after prolonged stimulation. Kang et al. undertook a reverse-translation approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the durability of T cell responsiveness to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Tsui and Kallies). Inspired by clinical observations from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome, the epigenetic regulators (Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1) associated with clonal hematopoiesis were identified using experimental models of T cell exhaustion. Epigenetic disruption of the polycomb group repressive deubiquitinase complex resulted in preservation of a stem cell–like T cell population that was responsive to immunotherapy. Extending this mechanism to cancer adoptive cell therapy, Asxl1 disruption was found to endow T cells with superior therapeutic efficacy and an ability to synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Sustained stimulation of CD8 T cells promotes the development of functional exhaustion, a terminal cell fate that has been broadly recognized to limit the durability of T cell–based immunotherapies. This state of exhaustion arises though a progressive transition of multipotent progenitor T cells (Tpex) into a terminally differentiated population (Tex) that has been defined as being nonresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The molecular determinants dictating the developmental transition are now being investigated as engineering targets to block the progression of T cell exhaustion and preserve the durability of immunotherapy approaches. RATIONALE We recently observed that the long-term survival of a small cohort of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with anti–PD-L1 therapy was coupled to mutation of the ASXL1 gene among their T cells. Mutations in ASXL1, in addition to DNMT3A and TET2, are commonly associated with conferring a survival advantage among hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in subclonal outgrowth referred to as clonal hematopoiesis. Because of their general link to cellular stemness, we investigated the role of these regulators in the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex and the impact of deletion of these regulators on therapeutic durability during anti–PD-L1 treatment. RESULTS To investigate the role of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in the development and maintenance of an ICB-responsive T cell population, we engineered T cells to contain mutations within each of these genes and then exposed them to a chronic source of antigen by adoptively transferring them into mice infected with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Disruption of these regulators in a canonical model of T cell exhaustion allowed them to maintain their quantity and ICB-responsive state for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Despite being stimulated and undergoing antigen-driven proliferation for 1 year, these T cells did not exhibit any signs of malignant outgrowth. Moreover, the total pool of T cells containing each of these mutations was enriched for a large quantity of stem-like Tcf1+ T cells. Fate-tracking adoptive transfer experiments revealed that this Tcf1+ subset of ASXL1 KO T cells could both self-renew and give rise to potent effectors. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of the knockout (KO) T cells identified Asxl1 as a regulator of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, controlling the deubiquitination of histone 2A lysine 119, which serves as a molecular checkpoint for the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex. Extension of this mechanistic insight into tumor models revealed that adoptively transferred T cells with Asxl1 disruption resisted tumor microenvironment–induced exhaustion. Moreover, the adoptively transferred Asxl1 KO T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 blockade, resulting in heightened tumor control. Finally, we show that Asxl1 disruption of tumor-specific T cells correlates with increased expansion of T cells in MDS patients after treatment with anti–PD-L1. CONCLUSION Results from these studies show that DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 control the developmental checkpoint between Tpex and terminally exhausted T cells. Specific investigation into Asxl1 revealed its role in T cell differentiation through epigenetic modification of the PR-DUB pathway. These data articulate a reverse-translation approach for defining molecular mechanisms that restrict maintenance of the ICB-responsive stem-like T cells within a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Through our mechanistic investigation of genes associated with patient survival, we have established a scientific rationale for specific genetic modification of discrete epigenetic regulators for future engineering to enhance the durability of cancer immunotherapy. Core epigenetic regulators in maintaining therapeutic durable multipotent Tpex populations. Using the canonical murine model system of exhaustion, disruption of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in CD8 T cells preserved an ICB-responsive Tpex population for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Specific investigation into the new epigenetic regulator Asxl1 revealed that this unprecedented maintenance of Tpex is mediated by presence of monoubiqutinated histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) through disruption of the PR-DUB complex.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The main challenge against patients with cancer to derive benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 appears to be the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), in which IL-33/ST2 signal fulfills critical functions. However, whether IL-33 limits the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 remains uncertain. Methods Molecular mechanisms of IL-33/ST2 signal on anti-PD-L1 treatment lewis lung carcinoma tumor model were assessed by RNA-seq, ELISA, WB and immunofluorescence (IF). A sST2-Fc fusion protein was constructed for targeting IL-33 and combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody for immunotherapy in colon and lung tumor models. On this basis, bifunctional fusion proteins were generated for PD-L1-targeted blocking of IL-33 in tumors. The underlying mechanisms of dual targeting of IL-33 and PD-L1 revealed by RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, FACS, IF and WB. Results After anti-PD-L1 administration, tumor-infiltrating ST2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were elevated. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signal with sST2-Fc fusion protein potentiated antitumor efficacy of PD-L1 antibody by enhancing T cell responses in tumor models. Bifunctional fusion protein anti-PD-L1-sST2 exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy compared with combination therapy, not only inhibited tumor progression and extended the survival, but also provided long-term protective antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the superior antitumor activity of targeting IL-33 and PD-L1 originated from reducing immunosuppressive factors, such as Tregs and exhausted CD8+ T cells while increasing tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that IL-33/ST2 was involved in the immunosuppression mechanism of PD-L1 antibody therapy, and blockade by sST2-Fc or anti-PD-L1-sST2 could remodel the inflammatory TME and induce potent antitumor effect, highlighting the potential therapeutic strategies for the tumor treatment by simultaneously targeting IL-33 and PD-L1.">

AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of trained immunity by reprogramming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow generating trained innate cells with enhanced responsiveness. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges.

Grem1 FRCs co-localize with DCs and express FLT3L in human and mouse lymph nodes. Using a new genetic model, we provide evidence that FLT3L produced by GREM1 FRCs maintains lymph node preDCs, cDCs, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Spatial transcriptomics and cytofluorometry reveal that Grem1 FRC-derived FLT3L supports not only proliferation, but also survival of lymph node cDCs within the interfollicular zone (IFZ). Functionally, loss of Grem1 FRC-derived FLT3L impairs cDC priming of antigen-specific T cell responses.

Tpex express high levels of Inducible Costimulator (ICOS), but the role of ICOS for PD-1+CD8 T cell responses has not been addressed. In chronic infection, ICOS-deficiency increased both number and quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells, with accumulation of effector-like Tex due to enhanced survival. Mechanistically, loss of ICOS signaling potentiated FoxO1 activity and memory-like features of Tpex. In mice with established chronic infection, ICOS-Ligand blockade resulted in expansion of effector-like Tex and reduction in viral load. In a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, ICOS inhibition improved cytokine production by tumor-specific PD-1+CD8 T cells and delayed tumor growth.

        <tr id="Despite the promising results of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, outcomes for patients with brain metastasis (BrM) remain poor. Identifying resistance mechanisms has been hindered by limited access to patient samples and relevant preclinical models. Here, we developed two mouse melanoma BrM models that recapitulate the disparate responses to ICB seen in patients. We demonstrate that these models capture the cellular and molecular complexity of human disease and reveal key factors shaping the tumor microenvironment and influencing ICB response. BR1-responsive tumor cells express inflammatory programs that polarize microglia into reactive states, eliciting robust T cell recruitment. In contrast, BR3-resistant melanoma cells are enriched in neurological programs and exploit tolerance mechanisms to maintain microglia homeostasis and limit T cell infiltration. In humans, BR1 and BR3 expression signatures correlate positively or negatively with T cell infiltration and BrM patient outcomes, respectively.

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

However, the ability of CD4+ T cells to suppress Mtb growth cannot be fully explained by IFN-γ or other known T cell products.

Although the recruited MDMs became quickly and preferentially infected with Mtb, CD4+ T cells rapidly disinfected the MDMs. Clearance of Mtb from MDMs was not explained by IFN-γ, but rather by MHCII-mediated cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells. These interactions promoted MDM expression of glycolysis genes essential for Mtb control. Thus, by recruiting MDMs, CD4+ T cells initiate a cycle of bacterial phagocytosis, Mtb antigen presentation and disinfection in an attempt to clear the bacteria from the lungs.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK+ macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK+ macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK+ macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of MerTK+ macrophages and provide strategies for improving the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Understanding the phenotypic and transcriptional signature of immunoglobulin E (IgE)–producing cells is fundamental to plasma cell (PC) biology and development of therapeutic interventions for allergy. Here, using a mouse model of intranasal house dust mite (HDM) exposure, we showed that short-lived IgE PCs emerge in lung draining lymph nodes (dLNs) during early exposure (<3 weeks) and long-lived IgE PCs accumulate in the bone marrow (BM) with prolonged exposure (>7 weeks). IgE PCs had distinct surface and gene expression profiles in these different tissues compared with other Ig isotypes. IgE BMPCs up-regulated genes associated with prosurvival and BM homing, whereas IgE dLN PCs expressed genes associated with recent class switching and differentiation. IgE PCs also exhibited higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein coding genes and higher antibody secretion rate when compared with IgG1. Overall, this study highlights the unique developmental path and transcriptional signature of short-lived and long-lived IgE PCs. IgE plasma cells are unique. Editor’s summary Immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated allergic diseases can be fatal, yet our understanding of IgE-producing plasma cells (PCs) is limited. Vecchione et al. used a transgenic mouse reporter strain to characterize IgE PCs during chronic house dust mite exposure. IgE PCs were transcriptionally and phenotypically unique compared with other immunoglobulin isotypes, with higher levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased antibody production. Short-lived IgE PCs appeared early in the lung draining lymph nodes post–allergen exposure, whereas long-lived bone marrow (BM) IgE PCs were not detected until much later. IgE BMPCs from humans with allergy also had unique transcriptional signatures. These findings demonstrate that IgE PCs are developmentally, transcriptionally, and functionally unique. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the major sentinel immune cells in human alveoli and play a central role in eliciting host inflammatory responses upon distal lung viral infection. Here, we incorporated peripheral human monocyte-derived macrophages within a microfluidic human Lung Alveolus Chip that recreates the human alveolar-capillary interface under an air-liquid interface along with vascular flow to study how residential AMs contribute to the human pulmonary response to viral infection. When Lung Alveolus Chips that were cultured with macrophages were infected with influenza H3N2, there was a major reduction in viral titers compared to chips without macrophages; however, there was significantly greater inflammation and tissue injury. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, recruitment of immune cells circulating through the vascular channel, and expression of genes involved in myelocyte activation were all increased, and this was accompanied by reduced epithelial and endothelial cell viability and compromise of the alveolar tissue barrier. These effects were partially mediated through activation of pyroptosis in macrophages and release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, and blocking pyroptosis via caspase-1 inhibition suppressed lung inflammation and injury on-chip. These findings demonstrate how integrating tissue resident immune cells within human Lung Alveolus Chip can identify potential new therapeutic targets and uncover cell and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Acquired resistance is a growing obstacle to durable responses after cancer immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The mechanisms by which heterogeneous tumors evolve under immunotherapy pressure and strategies targeting key populations to prevent relapse are poorly understood. We show that chronic interferon (IFN) enables a subpopulation of cancer cells to acquire inflammatory memory and express memory ISGs, a subset of IFN-stimulated genes enriched for immune evasion properties, leading to subclonal epigenetic evolution of ICB-resistant states. Inflammatory memory is epigenetically encoded through chronic virus mimicry – feedforward MDA5 signaling likely activated by endogenous retroelements. While JAK inhibitors can improve ICB response, combining them with TBK1 inhibitors collapses this feedforward mechanism, erasing inflammatory memory and preventing differentiation into resistance states. Across human cancers, small subpopulations of memory ISG-expressing cells are prevalent and coupled to T cell exhaustion, suggesting inflammatory memory may be a common mechanism of acquired resistance targetable by JAK plus TBK1 inhibition.">

To decipher the combinatory mode of action of TLR8 agonism and PD-1 blockade, we employed a unique, open-label, phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity clinical trial (NCT03906526) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T- cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients.

        <tr id="Macrophages orchestrate tissue homeostasis and immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

We evaluated functional consequences of a novel monoallelic TNFSF13 variant using biopsies, tissue-derived colonoids and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived colon organoids. TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited a >50% reduction in secreted TNFSF13, increased epithelial proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids.

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

Efforts to overcome this roadblock and achieve optimal immunity require an improved understanding of the molecular mediators facilitating NK cell-targeting of discrete subsets of CD4 T cells. We employed single-cell forensic victimology and CRISPR-Cas9 editing to delineate a transcriptional program uniquely responsible for the susceptibility of a subpopulation of CD4 T cells to perforin-dependent immunoregulation by NK cells. The unique vulnerability of these CD4 T cells relative to other subsets of CD4 T cells was not associated with a pattern of NK-cell-receptor ligand expression that would favor activation of NK cells. Instead, susceptible CD4 T cells were skewed toward follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation and exhibited intermediate expression of Klf2 and a related suite of KLF2-target genes (e.g. S1pr1) involved in cell migration and spatial positioning. NK-cell dependent suppression of the subset of Tfh exhibiting intermediate expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 was confirmed with single-cell proteomics. CRISPR targeting of KLF2 in CD4 T cells prevented suppression by NK cells. Thus, KLF2 regulation of spatial positioning of T cells is a key determinant of NK-cell immunoregulatory function and a possible target for strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract The treatment-induced activation level within the perivascular tumor microenvironment (TME) that supports T-cell trafficking and optimal T-cell differentiation is unknown. We investigated the mechanisms by which inflammatory responses generated by tumor-specific T cells delivered to ovarian tumor-bearing mice alone or after oncolytic vaccinia virus-driven immunogenic cancer cell death affect antitumor efficacy. Analyses of the perivascular TME by spatially resolved omics technologies revealed reduced immunosuppression and increased tumoricidal T-cell trafficking and function after moderate inflammatory responses driven by a CXCR4 antagonist-armed oncolytic virus. Neither weak nor high inflammation created a permissive TME for T-cell trafficking. Notably, treatment-mediated differences in T-cell effector programs acquired within the perivascular TME contrasted with comparable antigenic priming in the tumor-draining lymph nodes regardless of the activation mode of antigen-presenting cells. These findings provide new insights into combinatorial treatment strategies that enable tumor-specific T cells to overcome multiple barriers for enhanced trafficking and control of tumor growth. .">

        <tr id="The primary immune constituents in the brain, microglia and macrophages, are the target for HIV in people and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological dysfunction, known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Given the gaps in our knowledge on how these cells respond in vivo to CNS infection, we performed single-cell multiomic sequencing, including gene expression and ATAC-seq, on myeloid cells from the brains of rhesus macaques with SIV-induced encephalitis (SIVE) as well as uninfected controls. We found that the myeloid cell populations were significantly changed by SIVE. In SIVE microglia-like cells express high levels of chemoattractants capable of recruiting highly activated CAM-like cells to the site of infection/inflammation. A unique population of microglia-like cells was found in which the chromatin accessibility of genes diverged from their RNA expression. Additionally, we observed a dramatic shift of upstream gene regulators and their targets in brain myeloid cells during SIVE. In summary, this study further uncovers the transcriptome, gene regulatory events and potential roles of different brain myeloid phenotypes in SIVE.">

        <tr id="T cell heterogeneity is a cornerstone of the adaptive immune response, with CD8+ T cells playing a pivotal role in mediating cytotoxic responses to pathogens and tumors. While traditional studies have focused on phenotypic and functional diversity through surface marker expression and functional assays, the significance of biophysical properties in delineating T cell subpopulations remains underexplored. Here, we show that resting T cells exhibit a bimodal distribution in buoyant mass, which is not captured by surface marker based canonical immunophenotypes or physical parameters such as volume, density, dry mass, or light scattering. Functionally, we demonstrate that T cells with lower buoyant mass exhibit reduced proliferation, tend towards effector differentiation, and become more exhausted in the presence of innate tumor-secreted factors. Conversely, T cells with higher buoyant mass show greater memory potential and resistance to exhaustion. Our study not only provides insights into T cell biology but also suggests buoyant mass as a promising label-free biomarker to potentiate T cell-based therapies.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death among infectious diseases, with 10.6 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths reported in 2022, according to the most recent WHO report. Early studies have shown an expansion of γδ T cells following TB infection in both experimental models and humans, indicating their abundance among lung lymphocytes and suggesting a role in protective immune responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection. In this study, we hypothesized that distinct subsets of γδ T cells are associated with either protection against or disease progression in TB. To explore this, we applied large-scale scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data integration to define the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of peripheral blood γδ T cells. Our analysis identified five unique γδ T subclusters, each with distinct functional profiles. Notably, we identified a unique cluster significantly enriched in the TCR signaling pathway, with high CD81 expression as a conserved marker. This distinct molecular signature suggests a specialized role for this cluster in immune signaling and regulation of immune response against M. tuberculosis. Flow cytometry confirmed our in silico results, showing that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of CD81 expression on γδ T cells were significantly increased in individuals with latent TB infection (TBI) compared to those with active TB (ATB). This finding underscores the importance of CD81 and its associated signaling mechanisms in modulating the activity and function of γδ T cells under TBI conditions, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for TB management.">

How this symbiosis affects infection outcomes, and the host cell innate immune response is still poorly understood. Here we show that T. vaginalis extracellular vesicles down-regulate a non-canonical type I interferon, interferon-epsilon, and suppress type I interferon responses. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that infection with T. vaginalis in symbiosis with M. hominis or M. hominis alone upregulates genes involved in the type I IFN response, but infection with T. vaginalis alone does not. Finally, we show that interferon-epsilon stimulation is protective against T. vaginalis cytoadherence and cytolysis of host cells and increases the ability of neutrophils to kill the parasite. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response induced by a highly prevalent STI and its bacterial symbiont.">

One correlate of response is the reinvigoration of a subset of CD8 T cells that have an exhausted phenotype and impaired functionality. In order to develop new therapies, reproducible models are required to identify candidate target genes that enables the reversal of key hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Here we describe the development of an in vitro model by chronically stimulating T cells with their cognate antigen and performed an in depth temporal phenotypic characterisation. This model recapitulates many of the critical hallmarks of exhaustion, including increased expression of canonical exhaustion surface markers, impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production, decreased release of cytotoxic granules, and metabolic alterations, including dysfunctional mitochondria. These exhaustion hallmarks were validated using an in vivo model and a gene signature identified which robustly define the shared in vitro and in vivo exhausted state. Critically, this signature is also observed in tumour infiltrating T cells from multiple human tumour types, validating the translational potential of this model for discovering and triaging new therapies.">

Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the cotwin had either no or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease.

        <tr id="MALT1 protease is an intracellular signaling molecule that promotes tumor progression via cancer cell-intrinsic and cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. MALT1 has been mostly studied in lymphocytes, and little is known about its role in tumor-associated macrophages. Here, we show that MALT1 plays a key role in glioblastoma (GBM)-associated macrophages. Mechanistically, GBM tumor cells induce a MALT1-NF-κB signaling axis within macrophages, leading to macrophage migration and polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Inactivation of MALT1 protease promotes transcriptional reprogramming that reduces migration and restores a macrophage “M1-like” phenotype. Preclinical in vivo analysis shows that MALT1 inhibitor treatment results in increased immuno-reactivity of GBM-associated macrophages and reduced GBM tumor growth. Further, the addition of MALT1 inhibitor to temozolomide reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, which may enhance the efficacy of this standard-of-care chemotherapeutic. Together, our findings suggest that MALT1 protease inhibition represents a promising macrophage-targeted immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of GBM. Graphical abstract.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has quickly risen to become the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. This is in part because of its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here, we investigated an immunotherapy approach combining delivery of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) innate immune agonists by lipid-based nanoparticle (NP) coencapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies, which can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other proinflammatory signaling pathways, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell–driven and type I interferon–mediated tumor regression and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models dependent on both tumor and host STING activation. STING and TLR4-mediated type I interferon signaling was also associated with enhanced natural killer and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC samples. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can orchestrate a coordinated type I interferon–driven innate and adaptive immune response with durable antitumor efficacy against PDAC. Combining MEK/CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING/TLR4 agonists leads to T cell–mediated control of pancreatic tumors in mice. Editor’s summary Unlike other tumor types, existing immunotherapies have not proven very successful for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), necessitating the development of additional approaches. Here, Chibaya et al. developed a combination therapy approach that included nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists, which stimulate the immune response, in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which promote senescence of tumor cells. The combination therapy induced robust antitumor immune responses that controlled tumor burden in implanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models. These data support further development of this potent combination therapy for PDAC. —Courtney Malo">

Hallmarks of disease pathology include dysfunctional anti-viral responses and the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system. HAM/TSP individuals exhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with elevated co-expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), but ICP blockade strategies can only partially restore CD8+ T-cell effector function. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles, can enhance the spread of viral infections and blunt anti-viral responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of exosomes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells and HAM/TSP patient sera on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell phenotypes and function. We observed that exosomes derived from HTLV-infected cell lines (OSP2) elicit proinflammatory cytokine responses in DCs, promote helper CD4+ T-cell polarization, and suppress CD8+ T-cell effector function. Furthermore, exosomes from individuals with HAM/TSP stimulate CD4+ T-cell polarization, marked by increased Th1 and regulatory T-cell differentiation. We conclude that exosomes in the setting of HAM/TSP are detrimental to DC and T-cell function and may contribute to the progression of pathology with HTLV-1 infection.">

In vitro, CD300e-deficient macrophages exhibit enhanced pro-inflammatory activity and phagocytic capacity, coupled with reduced efferocytosis, suggesting a critical role for CD300e in promoting tumor progression. The depletion of CD300e, in vivo, results in a reduced tumor burden and enhanced survival in CRC mouse models, accompanied by a more robust anti-tumor immune response characterized by increased infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ. Our study provides comprehensive insights into the roles of CD300e in myeloid cells in CRC, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for reprogramming TAMs to support anti-tumor immunity.">

Natural killer (NK) cells from patients with myeloid malignancies display global dysfunction with impaired killing capacity, altered metabolism, and an exhausted phenotype at the single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In this study, we identified that this dysfunction was mediated through a cross-talk between NK cells and myeloid blasts necessitating cell-cell contact. NK cell dysfunction could be prevented by targeting the αvβ-integrin/TGF-β/SMAD pathway but, once established, was persistent because of profound epigenetic reprogramming. We identified BATF as a core transcription factor and the main mediator of this NK cell dysfunction in AML. Mechanistically, we found that BATF was directly regulated and induced by SMAD2/3 and, in turn, bound to key genes related to NK cell exhaustion, such as HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and CTLA4. BATF deletion enhanced NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism of NK immune evasion in AML manifested by epigenetic rewiring and inactivation of NK cells by myeloid blasts. This work highlights the importance of using healthy allogeneic NK cells as an adoptive cell therapy to treat patients with myeloid malignancies combined with strategies aimed at preventing the dysfunction by targeting the TGF-β pathway or BATF. BATF deletion prevents epigenetic rewiring and enhances the antitumor activity of NK cells in AML. Editor’s summary Patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often relapse after standard of care. To improve outcomes, Kumar et al. have investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in antitumor immunity against myeloid blasts and have identified global dysfunction of NK cells in these patients. They identified BATF as responsible for this dysfunction, and by knocking out BATF downstream of the TGF-β canonical pathway in NK cells, they were able to enhance NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. This has led to the initiation of a promising clinical trial using these TGFBR2 knockout NK cells against myeloid malignancies. —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key mediators of lung function and are potential targets for therapies during respiratory infections. TGFβ is an important regulator of AM differentiation and maintenance, but how TGFβ directly modulates the innate immune responses of AMs remains unclear. This shortcoming prevents effective targeting of AMs to improve lung function in health and disease. Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGFβ in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGFβ regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGFβ maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGFβ alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGFβ (+) and TGFβ (−) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists. Together, these data suggest that TGFβ modulates AM metabolic networks and innate immune signaling cascades to control inflammatory pathways in AMs.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

To date, it remains elusive how the duration of TN-DC interactions and integration of activation signals are controlled in vivo. Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses. In sum, our findings uncover that lymphoid stromal chemokines act as built-in “disruptors” of T cell-DC interactions for long-term preservation of TEFF functionality.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the regenerative force of the gut epithelium. Lgr5+-ISC have been shown to respond to changes in their microenvironment by coping with different metabolites, adapting to caloric changes, and recovering from injury and inflammation. However, how pathogenic bacteria affect adult stem cell regeneration and, as a consequence, the overall tissue adaption to infection has yet to be explored in depth. Here, we interrogated early Lgr5+ ISC responses to an enteric intracellular pathogen by profiling individual IECs from the mouse small intestine. Utilizing GFP-labeled Salmonella enterica, we isolated intracellular invaded cells to elucidate invasion programs of epithelial cell subsets. In particular, we identified a Salmonella-specific infection signature comprised of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including the Defensin gene family. Our findings demonstrate that Salmonella enterica targets differentiated Paneth, enterocytes, and stem/progenitor cells at these early stages of infection. In response, a rapid Lg5+ ISC-driven cellular remodeling to enterocyte and Paneth lineages expressing AMP genes is initiated to combat the intruders. Importantly, we uncovered an ISC differentiation program via inflammasome activation to protect the crypt environment, while eliminating infected stem cells from the overall stem cell pool. This novel Lgr5+ stem cell defense mechanism not only protects the gut epithelium from persistent bacterial infection but also promotes tissue regeneration. We propose epithelial remodeling to AMP-secreting cells as a novel innate immune response to handle different gut stresses mediated by Lgr5+ ISCs to maintain organizational principles of gut homeostasis and physiology.">

        <tr id="While neutrophils are the predominant cell type in the lungs of humans with active tuberculosis (TB), they are relatively scarce in the lungs of most strains of mice that are used to study the disease. However, similar to humans, neutrophils account for approximately 45% of CD45+ cells in the lungs of Apoe-/- mice on a high-cholesterol (HC) diet following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We hypothesized that the susceptibility of Apoe-/- HC mice might arise from an unrestrained feed-forward loop in which production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) stimulates production of type I interferons by pDCs which in turn leads to the recruitment and activation of more neutrophils, and demonstrated that depleting neutrophils, depleting plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), or blocking type I interferon signaling, improved the outcome of infection. In concordance with these results, we found that Mtb-infected in Apoe-/-HC mice produce high levels of LTB4 and 12-HETE, two eicosanoids known to act as neutrophil chemoattractants and showed that blocking leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor signaling also improved the outcome of tuberculosis. While production of NETs has been associated with severe tuberculosis in other mouse models and in humans, a causative role for NETs in the pathology has not been directly established. We demonstrate that blocking the activation of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), an enzyme critical to NET formation, leads to fewer NETs in the lungs and, strikingly, completely reverses the hypersusceptibility of Apoe-/-HC mice to tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma has a unique tumor microenvironment (TME), which is characterized as a complex microenvironment comprising of bone cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and heterogeneous vascular structures. These elements are intricately embedded in a mineralized extracellular matrix, setting it apart from other primary TMEs. In a state of normal physiological function, these cell types collaborate in a coordinated manner to maintain the homeostasis of the bone and hematopoietic systems. However, in the pathological condition, i.e., neoplastic malignancies, the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) has been shown to promote cancer cells proliferation, migration, apoptosis and drug resistance, as well as immune escape. The intricate and dynamic system of the TIME in osteosarcoma involves crucial roles played by various infiltrating cells, the complement system, and exosomes. This complexity is closely associated with tumor cells evading immune surveillance, experiencing uncontrolled proliferation, and facilitating metastasis. In this review, we elucidate the intricate interplay between diverse cell populations in the osteosarcoma TIME, each contributing uniquely to tumor progression. From chondroblastic and osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells to osteoclasts, stromal cells, and various myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets, the comprehensive single-cell analysis provides a detailed roadmap of the complex osteosarcoma ecosystem. Furthermore, we summarize the mutations, epigenetic mechanisms, and extracellular vesicles that dictate the immunologic landscape and modulate the TIME of osteosarcoma. The perspectives of the clinical implementation of immunotherapy and therapeutic approaches for targeting immune cells are also intensively discussed.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Antibodies that target immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) are approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. Chemotherapy is often administered with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies that target CTLA-4 and/or PD-(L)1. ICB targeting other immune checkpoints such as lymphocyte activating gene-3 (LAG-3) has the potential to improve antitumor responses when combined with chemotherapy. Response to anti-PD-1 ICB is dependent on progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) in the tumor, but it is unclear how chemotherapy alters TPEX proportions and phenotype. Methods Here we investigated whether sequential chemotherapy altered TPEX frequency and immune checkpoint expression in multiple murine tumor models. Results Two doses of two different anti-metabolite chemotherapies increased tumor infiltrating CD4+, and CD8+ TPEX expressing LAG-3 in multiple mouse models, which was not restricted to tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells. To determine if LAG-3+tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could be targeted to improve tumor control, we administered anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 ICB after two doses of chemotherapy and found combination therapy generated robust antitumor responses compared with each agent alone. Both anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 ICB with chemotherapy were required for the complete tumor regression observed. Conclusions Changes in immune checkpoint expression on TILs during chemotherapy administration informs selection of ICB therapies to combine with.">

        <tr id="The intestinal immune system maintains a balance between active immunity needed for protection and tolerance towards harmless antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) found in the intestinal mucosa are key to the adaptive arm of these immunoregulatory events. DCs sample antigens in the tissue and then migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime the T cells that then migrate back to the tissue as effector or regulatory cells. Intestinal DC are highly heterogeneous, and it remains unclear exactly which subsets induces the different kinds of immune response, or what signalling molecules and cellular mechanisms are involved. Here, we have studied these issues using Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) infection in mice, a model which is uniquely suited to dissecting this regulatory circuit in the gut, where it drives type 2 protective immunity at the same time as inhibiting other aspects of the immune response. Here, we characterise intestinal DC during Hpb infection for the first time. We observed a dynamical change of intestinal DC populations throughout the course of infection that correlated with altered phenotype and function. In particular, Hpb infection saw a rise in a population of CD103+ DC2 that retained a potent ability to drive Tregs during the infection and unlike CD103-DC2, had a reduced ability to induce pro-inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that TGFβ signalling may be responsible for some of the changes observed. This was confirmed in vitro, where supplementation TGFβ or Hpb-produced TGFβ mimic (TGM) replicated the immunomodulatory effects seen in DCs in vivo. Together, these results present a mechanistic explanation of how helminths such as Hpb may modulate host immune responses by altering the differentiation and function of local DCs. Furthermore, our work provides the basis for understanding immune homeostasis in the intestine at the molecular and cellular levels. Thus, this work fills out a crucial gap in our knowledge of basic biology underlining the DC decision between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response in the central circuit of adaptive immune response.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors have substantial advanced tumor treatment, but their limited benefits and strong responses in only a subset of patients remain challenging. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory function of contactin-4 (CNTN4). CNTN4 was highly expressed in tumor tissues, and expression impaired the antitumor function of T cells. CNTN4 bound to amyloid precursor protein (APP) on T cells, which attenuated conjugation between cancer cells and T cells, and diminished T cell receptor signaling cascades. We developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) that blocked the binding between CNTN4 and APP. Administration of either GENA-104A16 or 5A7 promoted antitumor T cell responses in a syngeneic mouse model and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo. Furthermore, elevated CNTN4 levels were associated with poor prognosis and negatively correlated with various cytotoxic immune-related markers. These results suggest that CNTN4-APP is an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Targeting the CNTN4-APP axis may boost anticancer immunity and improve conventional immunotherapy efficacy. Editor’s summary Contactin-4 (CNTN4) is an adhesion molecule known to engage amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain, but the function of this axis in T cells and antitumor immunity is not known. Jeon et al. explored the immunomodulatory role of CNTN4-APP, finding that CNTN4 expressed on tumor cells prevents T cell activation by engaging APP on T cells. They developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) and found that blocking the CNTN4-APP interaction promoted tumor killing. Expression of APP on T cells negatively correlated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. These findings indicate that CNTN4-APP functions as an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

        <tr id="Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.

        <tr id="CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to maintain peripheral self-tolerance and suppress immune responses to tumors. Their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with poor clinical outcome in several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC). However, the properties of intratumoral Tregs remain largely unknown. Here, we found that a functionally distinct subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, which express the Foxp3 splicing variant retaining exon 2 (Foxp3E2), is prominent in the TME and peripheral blood of hormone receptor- positive (HR+) BC subjects with poor prognosis. Notably, a comprehensive examination of the Tumor Cell Genome Atlas (TCGA) validated Foxp3E2 as an independent prognostic marker in all other BC subtypes. We found that FOXP3E2 expression underlies BCs with highly immune suppressive landscape, defective mismatch repair and a stem-like signature thus highlighting pathways involved in tumor immune evasion. Finally, we confirmed the higher immunosuppressive capacity of BC patients-derived Foxp3E2+ Tregs by functional assays. Our study suggests Foxp3E2+ Tregs might be used as an independent biomarker to predict BC prognosis and recurrence, and to develop super-targeted depletion-based immunotherapies.

        <tr id="Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks hormone receptors and HER2 amplification, making it unresponsive to standard hormone or HER2-targeted therapies. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, their efficacy remains limited in tumors with minimal lymphocyte infiltration. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. Methods We designed a chimeric cytokine receptor (ChCR) that triggers STAT1 signaling upon stimulation with IL-10 or TGFβ, cytokines prevalent in the TME that typically drive immunosuppression. Human primary macrophages were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the ChCR, and changes in their phenotype, secretome, and transcriptome were analyzed following stimulation. The anti-tumoral activity of these reprogrammed macrophages was assessed using co-culture assays with 3D TNBC spheroids. Results ChCR expressing macrophages showed robust STAT1 activation in response to IL-10 or TGFβ stimulation, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype similar to IFNγ activation, as confirmed by phenotypic markers, and transcriptomic profiling. These ChCR-stimulated macrophages demonstrated significant anti-tumoral effects in 3D TNBC spheroids. Moreover, ChCR stimulation led to the upregulation of genes associated with good response to ICIs, among others CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines essential for lymphocyte recruitment. Secretion of CXCL10 was also confirmed by ELISA. Conclusion We successfully engineered a ChCR that reprograms TAMs within an IL-10- and TGFβ-rich environment, inducing an inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumoral activity. The expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 further supports lymphocyte recruitment, potentially facilitating greater lymphocyte infiltration and disrupting the immunosuppressive TME. This approach offers a promising strategy to improve immunotherapy outcomes in TNBC patients, particularly those with low immune cell infiltration, thereby addressing a critical unmet clinical need.">

        <tr id="Background Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a serious liver disease characterized by immune disorders, particularly effector T-cell overactivation. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (MSC-EV) treatment on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and liver injury in AIH. Methods The metabolic changes of CD4+ T cells were assayed in human AIH and mouse hepatitis models. The liver protective effect of MSC-EVs was evaluated by transaminase levels, liver histopathology and inflammation. The effect of MSC-EVs on the metabolic state of CD4+ T cells was also explored. Results Enhanced glycolysis (eg, ~1.5-fold increase in hexokinase 2 levels) was detected in the CD4+ T cells of AIH patient samples and mouse hepatitis models, whereas the inhibition of glycolysis decreased CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.8-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and AIH liver injury (~6-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EV treatment reduced CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.5-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and cytokine release (~5-fold decrease in IFN-γ levels) by reducing glycolysis (~3-fold decrease) while enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (~2-fold increase in maximal respiration) in such cells. The degree of liver damage in AIH mice was ameliorated after MSC-EV treatment (~5-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EVs carried abundant mitochondrial proteins and might transfer them to metabolically reprogram CD4+ T cells, whereas disrupting mitochondrial transfer impaired the therapeutic potency of MSC-EVs in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusion Disordered glucose metabolism promotes CD4+ T-cell activation and associated inflammatory liver injury in AIH models, which can be reversed by MSC-EV therapy, and this effect is at least partially dependent on EV-mediated mitochondrial protein transfer between cells. This study highlights that MSC-EV therapy may represent a new avenue for treating autoimmune diseases such as AIH.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial in cancer development and therapeutic response. Immunotherapy is increasingly recognized as a critical component of cancer treatment. While immunotherapies have shown efficacy in various cancers, including breast cancer, patient responses vary widely. Some patients receive significant benefits, while others experience minimal or no improvement. This disparity underscores the complexity and diversity of the immune system. In this study, we investigated the immune landscape and cell–cell communication within the TME of breast cancer through integrated analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. We established profiles of tumor immune infiltration that span across a broad spectrum of adaptive and innate immune cells. Our clustering analysis of immune infiltration identified three distinct patient groups: high T cell abundance, moderate infiltration, and low infiltration. Patients with low immune infiltration exhibited the poorest survival rates, while those in the moderate infiltration group showed better outcomes than those with high T cell abundance. Moreover, the high cell abundance group was associated with a greater tumor burden and higher rates of TP53 mutations, whereas the moderate infiltration group was characterized by a lower tumor burden and elevated PIK3CA mutations. Analysis of an independent single-cell RNA-seq breast cancer dataset confirmed the presence of similar infiltration patterns. Further investigation into ligand–receptor interactions within the TME unveiled significant variations in cell–cell communication patterns among these groups. Notably, we found that the signaling pathways SPP1 and EGF were exclusively active in the low immune infiltration group, suggesting their involvement in immune suppression. This work comprehensively characterizes the composition and dynamic interplay in the breast cancer TME. Our findings reveal associations between the extent of immune infiltration and clinical outcomes, providing valuable prognostic information for patient stratification. The unique mutations and signaling pathways associated with different patient groups offer insights into the mechanisms underlying diverse tumor immune infiltration and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Currently, there are no effective therapies for glioblastoma. Infiltrating myeloid cells contributes significantly to the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment that is characteristic of GBM. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells are chief immune suppressive cells found in the glioma microenvironment. Understanding the mechanisms of M-MDSC differentiation and T-cell suppression is imperative for generating therapies that target this tumor-supportive cell population. In this study, we found that glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands, M-CSF and IL-34, promote M-MDSCs to suppress CD8 T cells. These M-MDSCs partially utilize nitric oxide synthase to illicit their suppressive activity. However, spatial RNAseq points to glioma microenvironment niches driving M-MDSC heterogeneity. Our findings identify key regulators of differentiation and suppressive mechanisms of M-MDSCs and confirm the importance of targeting this cell population in glioma. Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, resulting in poor survival despite aggressive therapies. GBM is characterized by a highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) made up predominantly of infiltrating peripheral immune cells. One significant immune cell type that contributes to glioma immune evasion is a population of immunosuppressive cells, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Previous studies suggest that a subset of myeloid cells, expressing monocytic (M)-MDSC markers and dual expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1, utilize CCR2 to infiltrate the TME. This study evaluated the mechanism of CCR2+/CX3CR1+ M-MDSC differentiation and T cell suppressive function in murine glioma models. We determined that bone marrow-derived CCR2+/CX3CR1+ cells adopt an immune suppressive cell phenotype when cultured with glioma-derived factors. Glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands M-CSF and IL-34 were identified as key drivers of M-MDSC differentiation while adenosine and iNOS pathways were implicated in the M-MDSC suppression of T cells. Mining a human GBM spatial RNAseq database revealed a variety of different pathways that M-MDSCs utilize to exert their suppressive function that is driven by complex niches within the microenvironment. These data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of M-MDSCs in glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="The thymus is the central organ involved with T-cell development and the production of naïve T cells. During normal aging, the thymus undergoes marked involution, reducing naïve T-cell output and resulting in a predominance of long-lived memory T cells in the periphery. Outside of aging, systemic stress responses that induce corticosteroids (CS), or other insults such as radiation exposure, induce thymocyte apoptosis, resulting in a transient acute thymic involution with subsequent recovery occurring after cessation of the stimulus. Despite the increasing utilization of immunostimulatory regimens in cancer, effects on the thymus and naïve T cell output have not been well characterized. Using both mouse and human systems, the thymic effects of systemic immunostimulatory regimens, such as high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) with or without agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs and acute primary viral infection, were investigated. These regimens produced a marked acute thymic involution in mice, which correlated with elevated serum glucocorticoid levels and a diminishment of naïve T cells in the periphery. This effect was transient and followed with a rapid thymic “rebound” effect, in which an even greater quantity of thymocytes was observed compared to controls. Similar results were observed in humans, as patients receiving HD IL-2 treatment for cancer demonstrated significantly increased cortisol levels, accompanied by decreased peripheral blood naïve T cells and reduced T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a marker indicative of recent thymic emigrants. Mice adrenalectomized prior to receiving immunotherapy or viral infection demonstrated protection from this glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution, despite experiencing a substantially higher inflammatory cytokine response and increased immunopathology. Investigation into the effects of immunostimulation on middle aged (7-12 months) and advance aged (22-24 months) mice, which had already undergone significant thymic involution and had a diminished naïve T cell population in the periphery at baseline, revealed that even further involution was incurred. Thymic rebound hyperplasia, however, only occurred in young and middle-aged recipients, while advance aged not only lacked this rebound hyperplasia, but were entirely absent of any indication of thymic restoration. This coincided with prolonged deficits in naïve T cell numbers in advanced aged recipients, further skewing the already memory dominant T cell pool. These results demonstrate that, in both mice and humans, systemic immunostimulatory cancer therapies, as well as immune challenges like subacute viral infections, have the potential to induce profound, but transient, glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution and substantially reduced thymic output, resulting in the reduction of peripheral naive T cells. This can then be followed by a marked rebound effect with naïve T cell restoration, events that were shown not to occur in advanced-aged mice.">

        <tr id="Proliferating tumor cells take up glutamine for anabolic processes engendering glutamine deficiency in the tumor microenvironment. How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets – cDC1 and cDC2, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on Glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mTOR signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses. One Sentence Summary Type 1 conventional dendritic cells require glutamine to maintain their number in non-lymphoid tissue. Significance Immune evasion is a key hallmark of cancer; however, the underlying pathways are diverse, tumor-specific and not fully elucidated. Many tumor cells avidly import glutamine to support their anabolic needs, creating a glutamine-deficient tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, using mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, we show that glutamine depletion in TME leads to reduced type 1 conventional dendritic cells – a cell type that is critical for adaptive immune responses. This work is a paradigm for how tumor cell metabolism can regulate anti-tumor immune responses and will be foundational to future efforts targeting glutamine metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Smooth muscle cell (SMC) plasticity and phenotypic switching play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, but their role in tumorigenesis is unknown. We investigated whether and how SMC diversity and plasticity plays a role in tumor angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment. Methods and Results We use SMC-specific lineage-tracing mouse models and single cell RNA sequencing to observe the phenotypic diversity of SMCs participating in tumor vascularization. We find that a significant proportion of SMCs adopt a phenotype traditionally associated with macrophage-like cells. These cells are transcriptionally similar to ‘resolution phase’ M2b macrophages, which have been described to have a role in inflammation resolution. Computationally predicted by the ligand-receptor algorithm CellChat, signaling from BST2 on the surface of tumor cells to PIRA2 on SMCs promote this phenotypic transition; in vitro SMC assays demonstrate upregulation of macrophage transcriptional programs, and increased proliferation, migration, and phagocytic ability when exposed to BST2. Knockdown of BST2 in the tumor significantly decreases the transition towards a macrophage-like phenotype, and cells that do transition have a comparatively higher inflammatory signal typically associated with anti-tumor effect. Conclusion As BST2 is known to be a poor prognostic marker in multiple cancers where it is associated with an M2 macrophage-skewed TME, these studies suggest that phenotypically switched SMCs may have a previously unidentified role in this immunosuppressive milieu. Further translational work is needed to understand how this phenotypic switch could influence the response to anti-cancer agents and if targeted inhibition of SMC plasticity would be therapeutically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), infects approximately one-fourth of the world’s population. While most infected individuals are asymptomatic, latent TB infection (LTBI) can progress to cause pulmonary TB (PTB). We recently reported an increased accumulation of mast cells (MCs) in lungs of macaques with PTB, compared with LTBI in macaques. MCs respond in vitro to Mtb exposure via degranulation and by inducing proinflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we show the dominant production of chymase by MCs in granulomas of humans and macaques with PTB. Using scRNA seq analysis, we show that MCs found in LTBI and healthy lungs in macaques are enriched in genes involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha, cholesterol and transforming growth factor beta signaling. In contrast, MCs clusters found in PTB express transcriptional signatures associated with interferon gamma, oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC signaling. Additionally, MC deficiency in the mouse model showed improved control of Mtb infection that coincided with reduced accumulation of lung myeloid cells and diminished inflammation at chronic stages. Thus, these collective results provide novel evidence for the pathological contribution of MCs during Mtb infection and may represent a novel target for host directive therapy for TB.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, yet targeting them for therapeutic intervention has been discouraged due to the associated risk of infections. Thus, identification of neutrophil subsets and their involvement in inflammatory conditions is warranted for targeted therapeutic strategies. This study, through screening of surface proteins on neutrophils isolated from different tissue microenvironments, identified a distinct neutrophil subset, CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils, expressing Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). Interestingly, these Sca1pos neutrophils were more abundant in the liver than BM, blood, and lungs. Further analysis revealed that Sca1pos neutrophils are mature and activated with enhanced effector functions, including superoxide generation, phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. Tracing studies demonstrated ageing-independent characteristics of Sca1pos neutrophils. Remarkably, Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophils promote T cell proliferation through ROS, while inhibition of Sca-1 restores T cell proliferation and ROS generation. Intriguingly, inflammatory as well as metabolic cues induce the transition of conventional neutrophils (Sca1neg) to Sca1pos neutrophils and differentiation of progenitors (granulocyte monocyte progenitors, GMPs) into Sca1pos neutrophils. Furthermore, in vivo models of acute inflammation, peritonitis, and chronic inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exhibit an increase of Sca1pos neutrophils at inflammatory sites, while the pharmacological approach using NAC specifically mitigates the expansion of these pro-inflammatory neutrophils. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel subset of Sca1pos neutrophils with implications for inflammation. Significance Statement Neutrophilic inflammation remains the leading driver in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Targeting neutrophil populations remained un-recommended due to hampering the immunological functions of neutrophils. The heterogeneity of neutrophils provides the perspective to target altered neutrophil subsets, but subtle changes defining neutrophil subsets make it complex and ambiguous. Our study identified abundant expression of Sca1on distinct neutrophils under steady state and inflammation. Thus, we reported previously undefined Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophil subsets and elucidated their regulation. This study further established their involvement in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. This understanding may further pave the way toward targeting specific neutrophil subsets in pathologies characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. Graphical Abstract Highlights CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophil subset identified with <1% presence in BM and >40% frequency in the liver. These neutrophils are mature and activated, demonstrating enhanced effector functions. Sca1pos neutrophils promote T cell proliferation and display pro-inflammatory characteristics. Conventional Sca1neg neutrophils transition into Sca1pos neutrophils in response to inflammatory signals, while progenitors undergo differentiation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory models show the expansion of CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils.">

        <tr id="Nociceptor neurons impact tumor immunity. Removing nociceptor neurons reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs) tumor infiltration in mouse models of head and neck carcinoma and melanoma. Carcinoma-released small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) attract nociceptive nerves to tumors. sEV-deficient tumors fail to develop in mice lacking nociceptor neurons. Exposure of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons to cancer sEVs elevated expression of Substance P, IL-6 and injury-related neuronal markers while treatment with cancer sEVs and cytotoxic CD8 T-cells induced an immunosuppressive state (increased exhaustion ligands and cytokines). Cancer patient sEVs enhanced DRG responses to capsaicin, indicating increased nociceptor sensitivity. Conditioned media from DRG and cancer cell co-cultures promoted expression of MDSC markers in primary bone marrow cells while DRG conditioned media together with cancer sEVs induced checkpoint expression on T-cells. Our findings indicate that nociceptor neurons facilitate CD8+ T cell exhaustion and enhance MDSC infiltration. Targeting nociceptor-released IL-6 emerges as a novel strategy to disrupt harmful neuro-immune interactions in cancer and enhance anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Biliary atresia (BA) is a leading cause of liver failure in infants. Despite effective surgical drainage, patients with BA exhibit attenuated immune responses to childhood vaccines, suggesting there are long-lasting alterations to immune function. The perinatal liver is home to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and serves as the epicenter for rapidly progressive and significantly morbid inflammatory diseases like BA. We have previously established the role of neonatal myeloid progenitors in the pathogenesis of perinatal liver inflammation (PLI) and hypothesize that PLI leads to long-term changes to HSPCs in mice that recovered from PLI. To test this hypothesis, we compared the changes that occur to HSPCs and mature myeloid populations in the bone marrow of adult mice during homeostasis and during PLI. Our results demonstrate that HSPCs from animals that recover from PLI (“PLI-recovered”) undergo long-term expansion with a reduced proliferative capacity. Notably, PLI leads to persistent activation of common myeloid progenitors through the involvement of CXCL10 and its canonical receptor, CXCR3. Our data suggests that the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis may mediate the changes in HSPCs that lead to altered immune function observed in BA, providing support for a targetable pathway to mitigate the detrimental long-term immune effects observed in patients with BA.">

Here we describe development of a humanized, three-dimensional, alveolus lung-on-a-chip (ALoC) model of Mycobacterium fortuitum lung infection that incorporates only primary human cells such as pulmonary vascular endothelial cells in a vascular channel, and type I and II alveolar cells and monocyte-derived macrophages in an alveolar channel along an air-liquid interface. M. fortuitum introduced into the alveolar channel primarily infected macrophages, with rare bacteria inside alveolar cells. Bulk-RNA sequencing of infected chips revealed marked upregulation of transcripts for cytokines, chemokines and secreted protease inhibitors (SERPINs). Our results demonstrate how a humanized ALoC system can identify critical early immune and epithelial responses to M. fortuitum infection. We envision potential application of the ALoC to other NTM and for studies of new antibiotics.">

To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

        <tr id="How group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate mucosal protection in the presence of T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we examined ILC3 function in intestinal immunity using ILC3-deficient mice that maintain endogenous T cells, T helper 17 (TH17) cells, and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were dispensable for generation of TH17 and TH22 cell responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and absence of ILC3s did not affect IL-22 production by CD4 T cells before or during infection. However, despite the presence of IL-22–producing T cells, ILC3s and ILC3-derived IL-22 were required for maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestinal epithelium. T cell–sufficient, ILC3-deficient mice were capable of pathogen clearance and survived infection with a low dose of Citrobacter rodentium. However, ILC3s promoted pathogen tolerance at early time points of infection by activating tissue-protective immune pathways. Consequently, ILC3s were indispensable for survival after high-dose infection. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent role for ILC3s in immune-sufficient animals and provide a blueprint for uncoupling of ILC3 and TH17 cell functions. In T cell–sufficient mice, ILC3s are required for mucosal protection from high-dose but not low-dose bacterial infection. Editor’s summary Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and immunity against gut pathogens. Distinguishing the functions of ILC3s from those of T helper 17 (TH17) cells has remained challenging because of similar transcription factor dependencies and cytokine production profiles. To better define ILC3-specific roles, Araujo et al. developed genetically engineered mice that lack ILC3s while retaining endogenous T cells and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were the primary producers of IL-22, which was required for the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Whereas TH17 cells were sufficient to protect against low-dose Citrobacter rodentium infection, ILC3s provided early protection and were required for survival after high-dose infection. Together, these findings identify nonredundant functions of ILC3s in mucosal homeostasis and immunity. —Claire Olingy">

Few T cells (<5%) express NKG2C or DAP12 proteins. CeD villous enterocytes express an IFNγ signature (by single cell RNA sequencing and nuclear phopho-STAT1 and HLA-DR protein staining).

Proximity ligation detected frequent interactions of αβ and γδ TCRs with HLA-E and HLA-B but not with HLA-DR and fewer NKG2C interactions with HLA-E. We suggest that CeD IFNγ-producing TCR αβ and γδ CTLs are recruited into villous epithelium by IFNγ-induced enterocyte production of CCR5 and CXCR3-binding chemokines and kill villous enterocytes primarily by TCR engagement with class I HLA molecules, including HLA-E, likely presenting gluten peptides.

However, limited information is available regarding the radiosensitivity of various hematopoietic cell populations in the bone marrow due to the high heterogeneity of the hematopoietic system.

Nonetheless, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and dendritic cells demonstrated a certain degree of radioresistance, with neutrophils exhibiting the most pronounced resistance. By employing single-cell transcriptome sequencing, we investigated the early responsive genes in various cell types following irradiation, revealing that distinct gene expression profiles emerged between radiosensitive and radioresistant cells. In B cells, radiation exposure led to a specific upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, suggesting a connection between these complexes and cell radiosensitivity. In neutrophils, radiation exposure resulted in fewer gene alterations, indicating their potential for distinct mechanisms in radiation resistance.

        <tr id="Monocyte-derived macrophages recruited into inflamed tissues can acquire an array of functional states depending on the extracellular environment. Since the anti-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic macrophage profile is determined by MAFB, whose activity/protein levels are regulated by GSK3, we addressed the macrophage re-programming potential of GSK3 modulation. GM-CSF-dependent (GM-MØ) and M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MØ) exhibited distinct levels of inactive GSK3, and inhibiting GSK3 in GM-MØ led to acquisition of transcriptional, phenotypic and functional properties characteristic of M-MØ (enhanced expression of IL-10 and monocyte-recruiting factors, and higher efferocytosis). These re-programming effects were also observed upon GSK3α/β knockdown, and through GSK3 inhibition in ex vivo isolated human alveolar macrophages (AMØ). Notably, GSK3 downmodulation potentiated the transcriptional signature of Interstitial Macrophages (IMØ) while suppressed the AMØ-specific gene profile. Indeed, heightened levels of inactive GSK3 and MAFB-dependent proteins were observed in severe COVID-19 patients lung macrophages, highlighting the GSK3-MAFB axis as a therapeutic target for macrophage re-programming.">

In our review, we addressed the functional distinctions between Foxp3+Tregs and other T cells, highlighting their roles in autoimmune diseases and cancer. We uncovered the dual nature of Tregs: they prevented autoimmune diseases by maintaining self-tolerance while contributing to tumor evasion by suppressing anti-tumor immunity. This study underscored the potential for targeted therapeutic strategies, such as enhancing Treg activity to restore balance in autoimmune diseases or depleting Foxp3+Tregs to augment anti-tumor immune responses in cancer. These insights laid the groundwork for future research and clinical applications, emphasizing the critical role of Foxp3+Tregs in immune regulation and the advancement of next-generation immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid malignancies arise in bone marrow microenvironments and shape these microenvironments in favor of malignant development. Immune suppression is one of the most important stages in myeloid leukemia progression. Leukemic clone expansion and immune dysregulation occur simultaneously in bone marrow microenvironments. Complex interactions emerge between normal immune system elements and leukemic clones in the bone marrow. In recent years, researchers have identified several of these pathological interactions. For instance, recent works shows that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), from bone marrow stromal cells contributes to immune dysregulation and the selective proliferation of JAK2V617F+ clones in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Moreover, inflammasome activation and sterile inflammation result in inflamed microenvironments and the development of myelodysplastic syndromes. Additional immune dysregulations, such as exhaustion of T and NK cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, and impairments in antigen presentation are common findings in myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the role of altered bone marrow microenvironments in the induction of immune dysregulations that accompany myeloid malignancies. We also consider both current and novel therapeutic strategies to restore normal immune system function in the context of myeloid malignancies.">

        <tr id="Emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive inflammation. Preclinical studies suggest that lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) treatment dampen inflammation. We investigated the effects of bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) and LVRS on circulating and pulmonary immune cell profiles in emphysema patients using mass cytometry. Blood and resected lung tissue were collected at the first LVRS (L1). Following 6–10 weeks of recovery, patients received a placebo or intravenous administration of 2 × 106 cells/kg bodyweight BM-MSC (n = 5 and n = 9, resp.) in week 3 and 4 before the second LVRS (L2), where blood and lung tissue were collected. Irrespective of BM-MSC or placebo treatment, proportions of circulating lymphocytes including central memory CD4 regulatory, effector memory CD8 and γδ T cells were higher, whereas myeloid cell percentages were lower in L2 compared to L1. In resected lung tissue, proportions of Treg (p = 0.0067) and anti-inflammatory CD163− macrophages (p = 0.0001) were increased in L2 compared to L1, while proportions of pro-inflammatory CD163+ macrophages were decreased (p = 0.0004). There were no effects of BM-MSC treatment on immune profiles in emphysema patients. However, we observed alterations in the circulating and pulmonary immune cells upon LVRS, suggesting the induction of anti-inflammatory responses potentially needed for repair processes.">

        <tr id="Background Immune therapies are emerging as a critical component of cancer treatment, capable of delivering durable and potentially curative responses. While CAR-T cell therapy has proven effective for hematological malignancies, it faces challenges in treating solid tumors due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and physical barriers hindering CAR-T cell infiltration. NK cells, particularly adaptive NK (aNK) cells, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization and their resistance to immunosuppressive environments. Purpose The study investigates the role of cytokines, specifically IL-21 and IL-15, in enhancing aNK cell expansion and activation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Methods Buffy coats and GBM TILs were collected from Karolinska Hospital. NK cells were isolated and expanded in vitro with IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines and feeder cells (K562 and K562E). Furthermore, tumor lysate was added in the cultures to boost memory responses in aNK cells. NK cell functionality, cytotoxicity, and phenotyping was assessed using flow cytometry and statistical analysis (t-test and two-way ANOVA) used to validate the results. Further animal model was used to validate the cytotoxicity capacities of these cells against GBM tumors using a zebrafish model. Results IL-21 drives the expansion of aNK better than IL-15 controls, data shown in PBMCs and TILs derived from GBM patients and IPLA OVCA patients. Additionally, the use of tumor lysate as a booster for restimulation further amplifies the cytotoxic capacity of aNK cells against autologous tumors. The zebrafish model validates this method, by decreasing the tumor size in zebrafish animals after 3 days of injection. Conclusion The results demonstrate that IL-21 is essential for the specific expansion of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. Additionally, tumor lysate significantly increases the cytotoxic efficacy of aNK cells upon restimulation with the same tumor cells. These findings suggest that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the specific expansion and activation of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. By optimizing the expansion protocol, this method aims to advance the clinical application of aNK cells in immunotherapies for solid tumors, offering a potential solution to the limitations faced by current CAR-T therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, with oncolytic adenoviruses showing power as immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic potential of an adenovirus construct expressing CXCL9, CXCL10, or IL-15 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor models. Our results demonstrated robust cytokine secretion upon viral treatment, suggesting effective transgene expression. Subsequent analysis using resistance-based transwell migration and microfluidic chip assays demonstrated increased T-cell migration in response to chemokine secretion by infected cells in both 2D and 3D cell models. Flow cytometry analysis revealed CXCR3 receptor expression across T-cell subsets, with the highest percentage found on CD8+ T-cells, underscoring their key role in immune cell migration. Alongside T-cells, we also detected NK-cells in the tumors of immunocompromised mice treated with cytokine-encoding adenoviruses. Furthermore, we identified potential immunogenic antigens that may enhance the efficacy and specificity of our armed oncolytic adenoviruses in ccRCC. Overall, our findings using ccRCC cell line, in vivo humanized mice, physiologically relevant PDCs in 2D and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in 3D suggest that chemokine-armed adenoviruses hold promise for enhancing T-cell migration and improving immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC. Our study contributes to the development of more effective ccRCC treatment strategies by elucidating immune cell infiltration and activation mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and highlights the usefulness of PDOs for predicting clinical relevance and validating novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Overall, our research offers insights into the rational design and optimization of viral-based immunotherapies for ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy is associated with profound changes in immunity. However, pregnancy-related respiratory immune adaptations in response to influenza infection and their impact on disease severity remain unclear. Here, we describe, in a preclinical model of mid-gestation pregnancy, a mechanism of enhanced host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) localized to the nasal cavity that limits viral replication and reduces the magnitude of intrapulmonary immune responses. Consequently, the pregnant mice show reduced pulmonary pathology and preserved airway function after IAV infection. The early restriction of viral replication is independent of type I interferon (IFN) but dependent on increased antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) driven by interleukin-17+ (IL-17+) γδ+ T cells within the nasal passages. This pathway of host defense against IAV infection in the upper airways during pregnancy restricts early viral infection and prevents virus dissemination into the lung supporting maternal fitness.">

        <tr id="Young children, especially those aged 4 months to 2 years of age, frequently exhibit severe morbidity during respiratory viral infections. For influenza infections, macrophages/monocytes serve as front line defenses against early viral replication in the lungs until the adaptive immune system arrives to clear virus. However, infiltrating inflammatory monocytes are a significant cause of influenza induced lung pathology/morbidity. We utilized a young murine model of respiratory viral infections using 21-day-old mice to investigate the mechanisms driving the heightened influenza induced morbidity observed in human young children. We hypothesized that macrophages/monocytes responses to influenza would diverge between young and older mice despite our evidence that macrophages from both groups appear to control viral replication at similar rates. While inflammatory monocyte infiltration contributed to influenza induced morbidity/lung inflammation in adults, they did not appear to contribute to morbidity in young mice. Instead, young mice appeared to develop lung inflammation through a lack of interferon gamma (IFNψ) and infection of macrophage populations. In contrast, adult mice controlled early viral replication through macrophage populations (alveolar, interstitial, and inflammatory) and inflammatory monocytes. While intrinsic limitations in anti-viral cytokine responses, especially IFNψ, characterized the macrophage response to viral infection in young mice, the innate immune response to infection appears diminished compared to adults. This study highlights the intrinsic limitations in macrophage effector functions that may arise in young children but that also contribute to disease pathology.">

        <tr id="Immune cell–mediated inflammation is important in normal tissue regeneration but can be pathologic in diabetic wounds. Limited literature exists on the role of CD4+ T cells in normal or diabetic wound repair; however, the imbalance of CD4+ Th17/Tregs has been found to promote inflammation in other diabetic tissues. Here, using human tissue and murine transgenic models, we identified that the histone methyltransferase Mixed-lineage-leukemia-1 (MLL1) directly regulates the Th17 transcription factor RORγ via an H3K4me3 mechanism and increases expression of Notch receptors and downstream Notch signaling. Furthermore, we found that Notch receptor signaling regulates CD4+ Th cell differentiation and is critical for normal wound repair, and loss of upstream Notch pathway mediators or receptors in CD4+ T cells resulted in the loss of CD4+ Th cell differentiation in wounds. In diabetes, MLL1 and Notch-receptor signaling was upregulated in wound CD4+ Th cells, driving CD4+ T cells toward the Th17 cell phenotype. Treatment of diabetic wound CD4+ T cells with a small molecule inhibitor of MLL1 (MI-2) yielded a significant reduction in CD4+ Th17 cells and IL-17A. This is the first study to our knowledge to identify the MLL1-mediated mechanisms responsible for regulating the Th17/Treg balance in normal and diabetic wounds and to define the complex role of Notch signaling in CD4+ T cells in wounds, where increased or decreased Notch signaling both result in pathologic wound repair. Therapeutic targeting of MLL1 in diabetic CD4+ Th cells may decrease pathologic inflammation through regulation of CD4+ T cell differentiation.">

Dendritic cells (DCs) constitute a heterogeneous group of antigen-presenting cells that are important for initiating and regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. As a crucial component of the immune system, DCs have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment of CRC. DCs cross-present tumor-related antigens to activate T cells and trigger an antitumor immune response. However, the antitumor immune function of DCs is impaired and immune tolerance is promoted due to the presence of the tumor microenvironment. This review systematically elucidates the specific characteristics and functions of different DC subsets, as well as the role that DCs play in the immune response and tolerance within the CRC microenvironment. Moreover, how DCs contribute to the progression of CRC and potential therapies to enhance antitumor immunity on the basis of existing data are also discussed, which will provide new perspectives and approaches for immunotherapy in patients with CRC.">

        <tr id="Lung tumor-promoting environmental exposures and γherpesvirus infections are associated with Type 17 inflammation. To test the effect of γherpesvirus infection in promoting lung tumorigenesis, we infected mutant K-Ras-expressing (K-RasLA1) mice with the murine γherpesvirus MHV68 via oropharyngeal aspiration. After 7 weeks, the infected mice displayed a more than 2-fold increase in lung tumors relative to their K-RasLA1 uninfected littermates. Assessment of cytokines in the lung revealed that expression of Type 17 cytokines (Il-6, Cxcl1, Csf3) peaked at day 7 post-infection. These observations correlated with the post-infection appearance of known immune mediators of tumor promotion via IL-17A in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, Cd84, an immune cell marker mRNA, did not increase in MHV68-infected wild-type mice lacking lung tumors. Csf3 and Cxcl1 protein levels increased more in the lungs of infected K-RasLA1 mice relative to infected wild-type littermates. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the infected K-RasLA1 mice had increased Ly6Gdim/Ly6Chi immune cells in the lung relative to levels seen in uninfected control K-RasLA1 mice. Selective methylation of adenosines (m6A modification) in immune-cell-enriched mRNAs appeared to correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. These observations implicate γherpesvirus infection in lung tumor promotion and selective accumulation of immune cells in the lung that appears to be associated with m6A modification of mRNAs in those cells.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment (TME) often fail to function as effective anti-cancer agents. Within the TME, cell-to-cell inhibitory interactions play significant roles in dampening their anti-tumor activities. Recent studies have revealed that soluble factors released in the TME by immune and non-immune cells, as well as by tumor cells themselves, contribute to the exacerbation of T cell exhaustion. Our understanding of the cytokine landscape of the TME, their interrelationships, and their impact on cancer development is still at its early stages. In this review, we aim to shed light on Interleukin (IL) -6, IL-9, and IL-10, a small group of JAK/STAT signaling-dependent cytokines harboring T cell-suppressive effects in the TME and summarize their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we will explore how advancements in scientific research can help us overcoming the obstacles posed by cytokines that suppress T cells in tumors, with the ultimate objective of stimulating further investigations for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract their tumor-promoting activities.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cell activation leads to the rapid proliferation and differentiation of effector T cells (Teffs), which mediate antitumor immunity. Although aerobic glycolysis is preferentially activated in CD8+ Teffs, the mechanisms that regulate CD8+ T cell glucose uptake in the low-glucose and acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the abundance of the glucose transporter GLUT10 is increased during CD8+ T cell activation and antitumor immunity. Specifically, GLUT10 deficiency inhibited glucose uptake, glycolysis, and antitumor efficiency of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Supplementation with glucose alone was insufficient to rescue the antitumor function and glucose uptake of CD8+ T cells in the TME. By analyzing tumor environmental metabolites, we found that high concentrations of lactic acid reduced the glucose uptake, activation, and antitumor effects of CD8+ T cells by directly binding to GLUT10’s intracellular motif. Disrupting the interaction of lactic acid and GLUT10 by the mimic peptide PG10.3 facilitated CD8+ T cell glucose utilization, proliferation, and antitumor functions. The combination of PG10.3 and GLUT1 inhibition or anti–programmed cell death 1 antibody treatment showed synergistic antitumor effects. Together, our data indicate that GLUT10 is selectively required for glucose uptake of CD8+ T cells and identify that TME accumulated lactic acid inhibits CD8+ T cell effector function by directly binding to GLUT10 and reducing its glucose transport capacity. Last, our study suggests disrupting lactate-GLUT10 binding as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance CD8+ T cell–mediated antitumor effects. GLUT10 enhances glucose uptake in CD8+ T cells to improve antitumor function. Editor’s summary CD8+ T cells are a critical part of antitumor immunity and depend on metabolites including glucose to maintain their function. Here, Liu et al. have evaluated targeting glucose transport 10 (GLUT10) as a way to increase CD8+ T cell function by disrupting the competitive binding of lactic acid that increased glucose uptake, thereby increasing proliferation and antitumor capacity. Authors developed a mimic peptide, PG10.3, to treat mouse models alone or in combination with anti–programmed cell death 1 to improve antitumor effects. This represents a new potential therapeutic option to improve outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy that will require further study. —Dorothy Hallberg">

We investigated how invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells influence colorectal cancer-derived liver metastasis using different models in immunocompetent mice. We found that hepatic iNKT cells promote metastasis by creating a supportive niche for disseminated cancer cells. Mechanistically, iNKT cells respond to disseminating cancer cells by producing the fibrogenic cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in a TCR-independent manner. Selective abrogation of IL-4 and IL-13 sensing in hepatic stellate cells prevented their transdifferentiation into extracellular matrix-producing myofibroblasts, which hindered metastatic outgrowth of disseminated cancer cells. This study highlights a novel tumor-promoting axis driven by iNKT cells in the initial stages of metastasis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Increased CD4+GNLY+ T cells have been confirmed to be inversely associated with CD4+ T cell count in immunological non-responders (INRs), however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of CD4+GNLY+ T cells and their relationship with immune restoration. Single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell TCR sequencing, and flow cytometry were used to analyze the frequency, phenotypes, and function of CD4+GNLY+ T cells. Moreover, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect plasma cytokines production in patients. CD4+GNLY+ T cells were found to be highly clonally expanded, characterized by higher levels of cytotoxicity, senescence, P24, and HIV-1 DNA than CD4+GNLY− T cells. Additionally, the frequency of CD4+GNLY+ T cells increased after ART, and further increased in INRs, and were positively associated with the antiretroviral therapy duration in INR. Furthermore, increased IL-15 levels in INRs positively correlated with the frequency and senescence of CD4+GNLY+ T cells, suggesting that CD4+GNLY+ T cells may provide new insights for understanding the poor immune reconstitution of INRs. In conclusion, increased, highly clonally expanded, and senescent CD4+GNLY+ T cells may contribute to poor immune reconstitution in HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Lung transplantation (LTx) outcomes are impeded by ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and subsequent chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). We examined the undefined role of receptor Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK) on monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) in efferocytosis to facilitate resolution of lung IRI. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients after LTx were analyzed. Murine lung hilar ligation and allogeneic orthotopic LTx models of IRI were used with BALB/c (WT), Cebpb–/– (MDSC-deficient), Mertk–/–, or MerTK–cleavage-resistant mice. A significant downregulation in MerTK-related efferocytosis genes in M-MDSC populations of patients with CLAD was observed compared with healthy individuals. In the murine IRI model, a significant increase in M-MDSCs, MerTK expression, and efferocytosis and attenuation of lung dysfunction was observed in WT mice during injury resolution that was absent in Cebpb–/– and Mertk–/– mice. Adoptive transfer of M-MDSCs in Cebpb–/– mice significantly attenuated lung dysfunction and inflammation. Additionally, in a murine orthotopic LTx model, increases in M-MDSCs were associated with resolution of lung IRI in the transplant recipients. In vitro studies demonstrated the ability of M-MDSCs to efferocytose apoptotic neutrophils in a MerTK-dependent manner. Our results suggest that MerTK-dependent efferocytosis by M-MDSCs can substantially contribute to the resolution of post-LTx IRI.">

The LN microenvironment puts selective pressure on cancer cells, creating cells that can survive in LN as well as providing survival advantages for distant metastatic spread.

However, recent studies have also characterized previously unrecognized roles for tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) in cancer immunotherapy response, including acting as a reservoir for pre-exhausted CD8+ T cells and stem-like CD8+ T cells. In this review, we will discuss the spread of cancer cells through the lymphatic system, the roles of TDLNs in metastasis and anti-cancer immune responses, and the therapeutic opportunities and challenges in targeting LN metastasis.">

        <tr id="Cytokine(s) pre-activation/licensing is an effective way to enhance the immunomodulatory potency of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Currently, IFN-γ licensing received the most attention in comparison with other cytokines. After licensing human bone marrow-derived MSCs with pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β1 alone or in combination, the in-vitro immunomodulatory potency of these MSCs was studied by incubating with allogeneic T cells and macrophage-like THP-1 cells. In addition, immunomodulation-related molecules filtered by bioinformatics, complement 1 subcomponent (C1s) and interferon-induced GTP-binding protein Mx2 (MX2), were studied to verify whether to reflect the immunomodulatory potency. Herein, we reported that different cytokines cause different effects on the function of MSC. While TGF-β1 licensing enhances the capacity of MSCs to induce T cells with an immunosuppressive phenotype, IFN-γ-licensing strengthens the inhibitory effect of MSC on T cell proliferation. Both TGF-β1 and IFN-γ licensing can enhance the effect of MSC on reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by M1 macrophage-like THP-1 cells. Interestingly, IFN-γ upregulates potential potency markers extracellular C1s and kynurenine (KYN) and intracellular MX2. These three molecules have the potential to reflect mesenchymal stromal cell immunomodulatory potency. In addition, we reported that there is a synergistic effect of TGF-β1 and IFN-γ in immunomodulation.">

Furthermore, several studies have shown that chronic inflammation in the digestive system is responsible for cancer incidence; therefore, controlling inflammation is a potential strategy to stop the development of cancer. Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC) represent a heterogeneous group of lymphocytes that exist in contrast to T cells. They function by interacting with cytokines and immune cells in an antigen-independent manner. In the digestive system cancer, from the inflammatory phase to the development, migration, and metastasis of tumors, ILC have been found to interact with the immune microenvironment and either control or promote these processes. The conventional treatments for digestive tumors have limited efficacy, therefore, ILC-associated immunotherapies are promising strategies. This study reviews the characterization of different ILC subpopulations, how they interact with and influence the immune microenvironment as well as chronic inflammation, and their promotional or inhibitory role in four common digestive system tumors, including pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular cancers. In particular, the review emphasizes the role of ILC in associating chronic inflammation with cancer and the potential for enhanced immunotherapy with cytokine therapy and adoptive immune cell therapy.">

Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) has become an essential target in cancer therapy due to its overexpression in various cancers, where it enhances regulatory T cell (Treg) function and supports tumor growth, often leading to poor outcomes. This study investigated the effects of NRP1 inhibition in B16-F10 melanoma and its impact on immune responses regulated by Tregs. NRP1 was overexpressed in several cancers, including B16-F10 cells, compared to non-cancerous NIH-3T3 cells. Inhibiting NRP1 selectively caused apoptosis in B16-F10 cells without affecting NIH-3T3 cells. It also reversed the immunosuppression of splenic T cells induced by B16-F10-conditioned media, reducing Treg markers (NRP1, NKG2A, FOXP3), Treg activity, and the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-17A). Furthermore, NRP1 inhibition increased T cell proliferation and boosted the release of effector cytokines (TNF, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-2). NRP1 inhibition also suppressed the STAT, ERK MAPK, and Smad2/3 pathways while activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In splenic T cells from B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with an NRP1 inhibitor, there was a decrease in Treg markers and activity, along with enhanced T cell proliferation. Additionally, NRP1 inhibitor treatment reduced lung metastasis, decreased tumor size, and improved survival in these mice. This study shows that inhibiting NRP1 may slow B16-F10 melanoma progression and reduce Treg-mediated immunosuppression. This suggests its potential as a promising approach in future cancer immunotherapies, especially in combination with other treatments.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) accumulate in the majority of solid tumors, producing inflammatory cytokines and growth factors involved in tumor maintenance. They have recently emerged as targets for restoring an effective antitumor response and limiting tumor growth. In the present study, we investigated the potential of IL-27 neutralization to modify macrophage polarization and thus the tumor immune microenvironment. We monitored the effect of IL-27 neutralization on human macrophages and in vivo in a murine colon adenocarcinoma model. In this study, we demonstrated the importance of IL-27 in the generation of human immunoregulatory macrophages. Mechanistically, IL-27 neutralization reduced the immunosuppressive properties of macrophages. These modifications led to a reduction in the ability of macrophages to inhibit the function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of IL-27 reduced MC38 tumor growth. Collectively, we uncovered the role of IL-27 in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. IL-27 neutralization thus appears as a promising strategy to target macrophages in immunosuppressive TME and improve the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy protocols.">

This review outlines the historical background, classification, and diversity of IM, elucidating its pivotal roles in oncogenicity, cancer development, and progression, alongside its influence on anti-tumor immunity. The signaling pathways through which IM impacts tumorigenesis and immunity, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), β-catenin, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and other pathways [NF-κB, Toll-like receptor (TLR), complement, RhoA/ROCK, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)], are discussed comprehensively. Furthermore, we briefly introduce the clinical implications of IM, emphasizing its potential as a target for novel cancer therapies, diagnostic biomarkers, and prognostic indicators. Notably, microbe-based therapeutic strategies such as fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT), probiotics regulation, bacteriotherapy, bacteriophage therapy, and oncolytic virotherapy are highlighted. These strategies hold promise for enhancing the efficacy of current cancer treatments and warrant further exploration in clinical settings.">

Here, we demonstrate that navitoclax, an orally bioavailable, small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, significantly improves pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) treatments as a host-directed therapy. Addition of navitoclax to standard TB treatments at human equipotent dosing in mouse models of TB, inhibits Bcl-2 expression, leading to improved bacterial clearance, reduced tissue damage / fibrosis and decreased extrapulmonary bacterial dissemination. Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we show that navitoclax induces apoptosis in several immune cells, including CD68 + and CD11b + cells. Finally, positron emission tomography (PET) in live animals using novel, clinically translatable biomarkers for apoptosis (18F-ICMT-11) and fibrosis (18F-FAPI-74) demonstrates that navitoclax significantly increases apoptosis and reduces fibrosis in pulmonary tissues, which are confirmed using post-mortem studies. Our studies suggest that proapoptotic drugs such as navitoclax can improve pulmonary TB treatments, and should be evaluated in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease, mediated by a complex interaction between B cells and various subsets of T cells. Dysfunction of helper T (Th) and regulatory T (Treg) cells may contribute to the breakdown of self-tolerance and the progression of autoimmune disease. In this study, we investigated the activity of Th and Treg cells on the differentiation of autologous B cells in vitro using cell cultures from the peripheral blood of healthy controls (HCs) and RA patients. The expressions of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and IL-21 were monitored as activation markers for Th cells. Unstimulated Th cells from RA patients showed remarkably higher PD-1 expression than HC samples. Stimulation of Th cells from RA patients with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) in the presence of B cells significantly induced their PD-1 and IL-21 expression at a considerably higher level in RA compared to HCs, and Treg cells did not affect IL-21 production. When monitoring B-cell differentiation, a significantly higher frequency of plasma cells was observed, even in unstimulated samples of RA patients compared to HCs. In the SEB-stimulated co-cultures of the RA samples, plasma cell frequency and IgG production were considerably higher than in HCs and were not significantly affected by Tregs. These findings demonstrate that Th cells are constitutively active in RA, and their hyperactivity upon interaction with diseased B cells may lead to uncontrolled antibody production.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the leading cause of mortality due to a single infectious organism. While generally curable, TB requires a lengthy and complex antibiotic regimen, due in large part to bacteria that can shift to a persistent state in the presence of antibiotic pressure. RelMtb is the primary enzyme regulating the stringent response, which contributes to the metabolic shift of Mtb to a persistent state. Targeting RelMtb with a vaccine to eliminate persistent bacteria through the induction of RelMtb-specific T-cell immunity in combination with antibiotics to kill dividing bacteria has shown promise in model systems. In a mouse model of Mtb infection, a vaccine created by genetically fusing relMtb to the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 3α (MIP3α), a ligand for the CC chemokine receptor type 6 (CCR6) present on immature dendritic cells, has been shown to enhance T-cell responses and accelerate eradication of infection in mouse models compared to a vaccine lacking the chemokine component. In this study, immunogenicity studies in the mouse and rhesus macaque models provide evidence that intranasal administrations of the DNA form of the MipRel vaccine led to enhanced lung infiltration of T cells after a series of immunizations. Furthermore, despite similar T-cell immunity seen in PBMCs between MipRel and Rel vaccinations, lung and bronchoalveolar lavage cell samples are more enriched for cytokine-secreting T cells in MipRel groups compared to Rel groups. We conclude that intranasal immunization with a MIP-3α fusion vaccine represents a novel strategy for use of a simple DNA vaccine formulation to elicit T-cell immune responses within the respiratory tract. That this formulation is immunogenic in a non-human primate model historically viewed as poorly responsive to DNA vaccines indicates the potential for clinical application in the treatment of Mtb infection, with possible application to other respiratory pathogens. Future studies will further characterize the protective effect of this vaccination platform.">

Exhausted-like CD8+ T cells (CD8+ Tex) displayed decreased effector and proliferative capabilities, elevated co-inhibitory receptor generation, decreased cytotoxicity, and changes in metabolism and transcription. TME induces T cell exhaustion through long-term antigen stimulation, upregulation of immune checkpoints, recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. CD8+ Tex may be both the reflection of cancer progression and the reason for poor cancer control. The successful outcome of the current cancer immunotherapies, which include immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell treatment, depends on CD8+ Tex. In this review, we are interested in the intercellular signaling network of immune cells interacting with CD8+ Tex.

NK cells suppressed thymus recovery by aberrantly targeting thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which act as the master regulators of organ function and regeneration. Together these studies reveal a novel pathway regulating tissue regeneration in the thymus and offer IL-18 as a potential therapeutic target to boost thymic function.

Monocytes act as immune sentinels for pathogens and can regulate immunity via interaction with other immune-cells, apart from differentiating into macrophages. Immune-checkpoint molecules (ICMs) expressed by immune-cells, including monocytes are known to negatively regulate immune-responses. Here, we evaluated the expression of ICMs, namely, Gal-9, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 on monocytes in different phases of CHI, identified the viral and the host factors causing their aberrant expression and investigated their impact during interaction of monocytes with T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells and also on monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Influence of Tenofovir therapy on the expression of monocytic ICMs was also studied.Collection of blood and liver-tissue samples from HBV infected patients and controls, flow-cytometry, cell sorting, cell culture and immune-fluorescence were performed for this study.Gal-9+ and PD-L1+-monocytes were significantly increased in HBeAg-positive as well as HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients than healthy controls (HC). In immune-tolerant (IT) subjects, only Gal-9+-monocytes and in inactive carriers (IC), PD-L1+-monocytes were higher than HC while CTLA-4+-monocytes remained comparable among groups. High serum Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration in CHB as well as IT and TNF-α in CHB triggered monocytic Gal-9-expression whereas, PD-L1 was induced by elevated TNF-α and IL-4 in CHB and IL-1β in CHB and IC. Purified monocytes from CHB and IT having high Gal-9 expression led to expansion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+-Tregs, CD19+IL-10+-Bregs and CD19+CD27-CD21–atypical memory B-cells and these monocytes also preferentially differentiated into M2-macrophages. These phenomena were reversed by anti-Gal-9-antibody. Parallelly, PD-L1+-monocytes in CHB and IC reduced IL-2/IFN-γ and IL-6 production by HBV-specific T- and B-cells respectively, which were restored by anti-PD-L1-antibody. Both Gal-9+- and PD-L1+-monocytes caused decline in IFN-γ+-NK-cells but enhanced IL-10-expressing HBV-specific-T-cells and NK-cells. Increased intrahepatic CD14+Gal-9+ and CD14+PD-L1+-monocytes were noted in CHB patients than HC. One-year tenofovir therapy failed to reduce monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1 along with the levels of HBsAg, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4.Monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1, expressed heterogeneously in different phases of CHI, exert diverse inhibitory effects on immune-responses and their therapeutic targeting could boost anti-HBV immunity.">

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignancy with significant immunosuppressive properties and limited immune activation. This immunosuppression is linked to reduced cytotoxic T-cell activity, impaired antigen presentation, and elevated levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. Studies demonstrate that cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration correlates with improved survival, while increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with worse outcomes and therapeutic resistance. Th1 cells are beneficial, whereas Th17 cells, producing interleukin-17 (IL-17), contribute to tumor progression. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3 are also linked to advanced stages of PCa. Chemotherapy holds promise in converting the "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) to a "hot" one by depleting immunosuppressive cells and enhancing tumor immunogenicity.


SUMMARY
This comprehensive review examines the immune microenvironment in PCa, focusing on the intricate interactions between immune and tumor cells in the TME. It highlights how TAMs, Tregs, cytotoxic T cells, and other immune cell types contribute to tumor progression or suppression and how PCa's low immunogenicity complicates immunotherapy.


KEY MESSAGES
The infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Th1 cells correlates with better outcomes, while elevated Tregs and TAMs promote tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance. TANs and NK cells exhibit dual roles, with higher NK cell levels linked to better prognoses. Immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM-3 are associated with advanced disease. Chemotherapy can improve tumor immunogenicity by depleting Tregs and MDSCs, offering therapeutic promise.">

        <tr id="Cancer, a heterogeneous disease in nature, often requires help from diverse pro-tumor or tumor-associated- cells, which are recruited and persevered within the stroma. Pro-tumor stromal cells provide the essential support needed for tumor growth, metastasis, and development of drug resistance in due time. Tumor-associated macrophages, one of such cells, are essential to tumor microenvironment and tumor survival. In recent years, TAMs have been identified as potential drug targets and therapeutic agents, which encourages the in-depth characterization of their crosstalk with the tumors. The current study has successfully developed a cost-effective in vitro platform for Chemokine Assisted Recruitment of Macrophages to spheroids mimicking the physiology of TAM recruitment. Firstly, monocytic cell line (U937) were converted into activated naive macrophages (M0) and pro-and anti-inflammatory (M1 and M2) subtypes. Monocytes, M0, M1, and M2 macrophages are characterized extensively. Secondly, the naive and polarized macrophages were subjected to chemokine-dependent recruitment into monotypic and heterotypic breast cancer spheroids. The nature of the recruitment is further investigated by assessing the profile of chemokines and chemokine receptors. Recruited macrophages are also observed to manipulate spheroid behavior in many ways. The recruited macrophages also exhibit an increased level of Siglec-1 (CD169), one of the potential TAM markers. The current platform’s potential for application can be extended to understand the recruitment process of other immune/stromal cells to solid tumors. It could be a potential addition to the arrays of in vitro platforms developed to screen the efficiency of cell-based immunotherapeutics in the future.">

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity through their immunosuppressive function. There have been numerous reports confirming that high levels of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are associated with a poor prognosis, highlighting their role in promoting an immunosuppressive environment. In breast cancer (BC), Tregs interact with cancer cells, ultimately leading to the suppression of immune surveillance and promoting tumor progression. This review discusses the dual role of Tregs in breast cancer, and explores the controversies and therapeutic potential associated with targeting these cells. Researchers are investigating various strategies to deplete or inhibit Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine antagonists, and metabolic inhibition. However, the heterogeneity of Tregs and the variable precision of treatments pose significant challenges. Understanding the functional diversity of Tregs and the latest advances in targeted therapies is critical for the development of effective therapies. This review highlights the latest approaches to Tregs for BC treatment that both attenuate Treg-mediated immunosuppression in tumors and maintain immune tolerance, and advocates precise combination therapy strategies to optimize breast cancer outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are mechanisms that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and avoid destruction by the body’s immune system. Tumor cells exploit immune checkpoint proteins to inhibit T cell activation, thus enhancing their resistance to immune attacks. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, like nivolumab, work by reactivating these suppressed T cells to target cancer cells. However, this reactivation can disrupt immune balance and cause immune-related adverse events. This report presents a rare case of prurigo nodularis that developed six months after administering nivolumab for lung adenocarcinoma. While immune-related adverse events are commonly linked to T helper-1- or T helper-17-type inflammations, T helper-2-type inflammatory reactions, as observed in our case, are unusual. The PD-1–PD-L1 pathway is typically associated with T helper-1 and 17 responses, whereas the PD-1–PD-L2 pathway is linked to T helper-2 responses. Inhibition of PD-1 can enhance PD-L1 functions, potentially shifting the immune response towards T helper-1 and 17 types, but it may also influence T helper-2-type inflammation. This study reviews T helper-2-type inflammatory diseases emerging from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, highlighting the novelty of our findings.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro-cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer-supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell-mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer presents as an immunologically "cold" malignancy, characterized by a lack of response to immunotherapy in the majority of patients. The dysfunction of prostate tumor metabolism is recognized as a critical factor in immune evasion, resulting in reduced effectiveness of immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite this awareness, the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning metabolic dysregulation in prostate cancer and its intricate relationship with immune evasion remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, we introduce the multi-drug resistance protein ABCC4/MRP4 as a key player prominently expressed in prostate cancer, exerting a pivotal role in suppressing the activity of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Depletion of ABCC4 in prostate cancer cells halts the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a molecule that diminishes the population of CD8+ T cells and curtails their cytotoxic capabilities. Conversely, constraining the activation of PGE2 signaling in CD8+ T cells effectively improved the efficacy of prostate cancer treatment with PD-1 blockade. During this process, downregulation of the JAK1-STAT3 pathway and depolarization of mitochondria emerge as crucial factors contributing to T cell anergy. Collectively, our research identifies the ABCC4-PGE2 axis as a promising target for reversing dysfunction within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and augmenting the suboptimal responsiveness to immunotherapy in prostate cancer.">

This study aimed to examine whether early host-pathogen interactions contribute to the heightened vulnerability of males to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Using recombination activating gene knockout (RAG KO) mice, which lack adaptive immunity, we were able to isolate and analyze innate immune responses to Mtb without the influence of T and B cells. Surprisingly, and in stark contrast to wild-type mice that reflect the male bias as observed in humans, female RAG KO mice were more susceptible to Mtb than their male counterparts. Increased lung CFU in females was accompanied by a significant rise in inflammation, indicated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as a massive influx of neutrophils into the lungs. In contrast, male mice exhibited higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL5, along with a greater presence of NK cells in their lungs, suggesting that, in the absence of adaptive immunity, males benefit from a more robust NK cell response, potentially offering greater protection by better controlling inflammation and slowing disease progression.">

CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy. Our research revealed one mechanism by which hepatoma cells can survive the combination therapy, providing a theoretical basis for the refined treatment of HCC.">

        <tr id="The infiltration of immune cells into the central nervous system mediates the development of autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases. We previously showed that the loss of either Fabp5 or calnexin causes resistance to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that brain endothelial cells lacking either Fabp5 or calnexin have an increased abundance of cell surface CD200 and soluble CD200 (sCD200) as well as decreased T-cell adhesion. In a tissue culture model of the blood–brain barrier, antagonizing the interaction of CD200 and sCD200 with T-cell CD200 receptor (CD200R1) via anti-CD200 blocking antibodies or the RNAi-mediated inhibition of CD200 production by endothelial cells increased T-cell adhesion and transmigration across monolayers of endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that sCD200 produced by brain endothelial cells regulates immune cell trafficking through the blood–brain barrier and is primarily responsible for preventing activated T-cells from entering the brain.">

        <tr id="Abstract Aims SARS‐CoV‐2 causes systemic immune dysfunction, leading to severe respiratory dysfunction and multiorgan dysfunction. Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) therapy is designed to regulate an excessive inflammatory response and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We aimed to investigate a targeted subset of granulocytes and monocytes to be removed after GMA therapy in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection. Methods We established an ex vivo experimental system to study the effects of GMA. Blood samples were collected into EDTA‐treated tubes and a mixture of blood samples and cellulose acetate beads was used in GMA. After GMA, blood samples were removed, and the granulocyte and monocyte subtypes before and after GMA were determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. To analyze mass cytometry data with a self‐organizing map, hierarchical clustering was used to determine the appropriate number of metaclusters from t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results We included seven patients with severe COVID‐19 and four age‐ and sex‐matched volunteers. Granulocyte subsets removed by GMA strongly expressed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b, and weakly expressed CD11c, consistent with mature and activated neutrophils. Monocyte subsets strongly expressed CD14, weakly expressed CD33 and CD45RO, and did not express CD16. These subsets were indicated to promote the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate T cells. Conclusions The identification of the granulocyte and monocyte subsets removed after GMA in patients with severe COVID‐19 may help explain the potential mechanism underlying the effectiveness of GMA in COVID‐19 and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The control of bacterial growth is key to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Granulomas represent independent foci of the host immune response that present heterogeneous capacity for control of bacterial growth. At the whole tissue level, B cells and CD4 or CD8 T cells have an established role in immune protection against TB. Immune cells interact within each granuloma response, but the impact of granuloma immune composition on bacterial replication remains unknown. Here we investigate the associations between immune cell composition, including B cell, CD4, and CD8 T cells, and the state of replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) within the granuloma. A measure of ribosomal RNA synthesis, the RS ratio®, represents a proxy measure of Mtb replication at the whole tissue level. We adapted the RS ratio through use of in situ hybridization, to identify replicating and non-replicating Mtb within each designated granuloma. We applied a regression model to characterize the associations between immune cell populations and the state of Mtb replication within each respective granuloma. In the evaluation of nearly 200 granulomas, we identified heterogeneity in both immune cell composition and proportion of replicating bacteria. We found clear evidence of directional associations between immune cell composition and replicating Mtb. Controlling for vaccination status and endpoint post-infection, granulomas with lower CD4 or higher CD8 cell counts are associated with a higher percent of replicating Mtb. Conversely, changes in B cell proportions were associated with little change in Mtb replication. This study establishes heterogeneity across granulomas, demonstrating that certain immune cell types are differentially associated with control of Mtb replication. These data suggest that evaluation at the granuloma level may be imperative to identifying correlates of immune protection.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular events seem to occur more frequently after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests a possible role of immune checkpoints in accelerating atherosclerosis formation. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of soluble and membrane-bound immune checkpoints in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We assessed the levels of 14 soluble immune checkpoints in fasting blood plasma of PAD patients (intermittent claudication, n= 37) and healthy controls (HCs, n=39) by Multiplex protein assay. We measured the levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1/2), B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), glucocorticoid-induced TNRF-related protein (GITR), herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), CD28, CD27, CD80, CD137 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). The surface expression of CD28, PD-L2, PD-1, GITR, LAG-3, TIM-3 and BTLA on peripheral blood immune cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine production capacity was measured by flow cytometry in TIM-3+ T cells to determine immune exhaustion. Soluble levels of PD-L2 were decreased in PAD patients, but only in females, whereas soluble levels of TIM-3 showed a trend towards increased concentration in female PAD patients. All monocyte subsets had increased frequencies of PD-L2+ cells in PAD patients. CD4+ T cells had increased frequencies of TIM-3+ cells, which showed little overlap with other immune exhaustion markers. TIM-3+ CD4+ T cells appeared to have a low capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, but a higher capacity to produce IL-10 compared to TIM-3-CD4+ T cells. We found that PAD patients show differences in expression of both membrane-bound and soluble immune checkpoints. Some of these differences might be caused by prolonged immune activation, although immune exhaustion markers did not always overlap.">

        <tr id="Introduction The role of zinc (Zn) in tumor development and immune modulation has always been paradoxical. This study redefines our understanding of the impact of Zn on cancer progression and therapeutic strategies. Methods We investigated the effects of dietary Zn levels on tumor progression and immune responses. This included examining the impact of both high and deficient dietary Zn, as well as Zn chelation, on tumor growth and immune cell populations. Specifically, we analyzed the frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and identified the role of FOXO1 in Zn-mediated effects on Tregs. Additionally, we explored the therapeutic potential of clioquinol (CQ) in enhancing α-PD-1 immunotherapy responses, particularly in melanoma. Results Our findings show that high dietary Zn promotes tumor progression by fostering a protumorigenic environment mediated by T cells. Increased Zn intake was found to facilitate tumor progression by increasing Foxp3+ Treg frequency. In contrast, deficiency in dietary Zn and chelation of tissue Zn emerged as potent drivers of antitumor immunity. We pinpointed FOXO1 as the master regulator governing the influence of Zn on Tregs. Discussion These results reveal a novel mechanistic insight into how Zn influences tumor progression and immune regulation. The identification of FOXO1 as a key regulator opens new avenues for understanding the role of Zn in cancer biology. Furthermore, we introduce a promising therapeutic approach by showing that administering clioquinol (CQ) significantly enhances α-PD-1 immunotherapy response, particularly in melanoma. These revelations transform our comprehension of the multifaceted role of Zn in tumorigenesis and immune regulation, highlighting innovative possibilities for cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that can cause pulmonary hypertension (PH). Th2 CD4 T cells are necessary for experimental Schistosoma-PH. However, if T cells migrate to the lung to initiate, the localized inflammation that drives vascular remodeling and PH is unknown. Methods: Mice were sensitized to Schistosoma mansoni eggs intraperitoneally and then challenged using tail vein injection. FTY720 was administered, which blocks lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. T cells were quantified using flow cytometry, PH severity via heart catheterization, and cytokine concentration through ELISA. Results: FTY720 decreased T cells in the peripheral blood, and increased T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes. However, FTY720 treatment resulted in no change in PH or type 2 inflammation severity in mice sensitized and challenged with S. mansoni eggs, and the number of memory and effector CD4 T cells in the lung parenchyma was also unchanged. Notably, intraperitoneal Schistosoma egg sensitization alone resulted in a significant increase in intravascular lymphocytes and T cells, including memory T cells, although there was no significant change in parenchymal cell density, IL-4 or IL-13 expression, or PH. Conclusion: Blocking T cell migration did not suppress PH following Schistosoma egg challenge. Memory CD4 T cells, located in the lung intravascular space following egg sensitization, appear sufficient to cause type 2 inflammation and PH.">

Methods: IHC and multiplex IHC analysis the relationships among tumour-associated macrophage (TAM), VM and EBV infection in EBV-associated epithelial cancer biopsies. In vitro and in vivo evidence using CRISPR-Cas9 system engineered EBV-infected epithelial cancer cells and mouse models support functional role and mechanism for M2c-like macrophages in the VM formation. The prediction of VM in the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic agent was analysed using clinical datasets. Results: EBV-associated epithelial cancer biopsies revealed that infiltration of the TAM surrounding the VM is closely associated with EBV infection. AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway in EBV-infected epithelial cancer cells control the secretion of CCL5 and CSF-1, enabling the recruitment of monocytes and their differentiation into M2c macrophages which promote VM formation by MMP9. Combination of anti-angiogenesis agents and HIF-1α inhibitor caused marked decreases in CD31-positive micro-vessels, VM, and M2c-like macrophages. VM scores can be used as biomarkers to predict the efficacy of anti-angiogenic agent therapy in EBV-associated epithelial cancers. Conclusions: Our findings define a secretory cross-talk between tumour cells and the immune microenvironment in EBV-associated epithelial cancer, revealing an unexpected role of EBV in epithelial cancer cells, controlling VM formation via M2c-like macrophages.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are essential components of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in immune responses. These cells rapidly migrate to sites of inflammation or tissue injury, facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair. The chemotactic signaling network regulating neutrophil recruitment is complex and not fully understood, particularly regarding damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In our previous research, we identified NMI as a DAMP that activates dendritic cells and macrophages, amplifying inflammatory responses and contributing to both acute and chronic inflammation. In this study, we investigated the role of NMI in neutrophil recruitment. We purified and characterized a recombinant murine NMI protein, ensuring endotoxin removal while preserving biological activity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that NMI enhances neutrophil recruitment in both a murine air pouch model and an acute peritonitis model, mediated by macrophage-derived chemokines. In vitro assays revealed a concentration-dependent increase in neutrophil migration induced by NMI, facilitated by chemokine secretion and subsequent migration through the CXCR2 receptor. Importantly, we established that NMI activates chemokine expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of NMI-induced neutrophil migration, enhancing our understanding of neutrophil recruitment during inflammation.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to unprecedented success in treating relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The most common CAR-T cell products currently in the clinic for DLBCL differ in their co-stimulation moiety, containing either CD28 or 4-1BB, which initiate distinct signalling pathways. Previous work has highlighted the importance of T cell metabolism in fuelling anti-cancer function. We have studied the metabolic characteristics induced by CD28 versus 4-1BB co-stimulation in patient CAR-T cells ex vivo. Our data show that in patients, CD28 and 4-1BB drive significantly divergent metabolic profiles. CD28 signalling endows T cells with a preferentially glycolytic metabolism supporting an effector phenotype and increased expansion capacity, while 4-1BB co-stimulation preserves mitochondrial fitness and results in memory-like differentiation. Despite this divergent programming, T cells in patients responding successfully to therapy were metabolically similar, irrespective of co-stimulator, suggesting that efficient fuelling of CAR-T cells in lymphoma requires a ‘balanced’ metabolism. In contrast, CAR-T cells in non-responders were pushed to their metabolic extremes. One sentence summary CD28 and 4-1BB signalling drive divergent metabolic profiles in patient CAR-T cells, however patients that respond to therapy have CAR-T cells that maintain metabolic balance.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignancy of immature myeloid blast cells with stem-like and chemoresistant cells being retained in the bone marrow through CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling. Current CXCR4 inhibitors mobilize AML cells into the bloodstream where they become more chemosensitive have failed to improve patient survival, likely reflecting persistent receptor localization on target cells. Here we characterize the signaling properties of CXCL12-locked dimer (CXCL12-LD), a bioengineered variant of the dimeric CXCL12 structure. CXCL12-LD binding resulted in lower levels of G protein, β-arrestin, and intracellular calcium mobilization, consistent with the locked dimer being a partial agonist of CXCR4. Further, CXCL12-LD failed to induce chemotaxis in AML cells. Despite these partial agonist properties, CXCL12-LD increased CXCR4 internalization compared to wildtype and locked-monomer forms of CXCL12. Analysis of a previously published AML transcriptomic data showed CXCR4 positive AML cells co-express genes involved in chemoresistance and maintenance of a blast-like state. The CXCL12-LD partial agonist effectively mobilized stem cells into the bloodstream in mice suggesting a potential role for their use in targeting CXCR4. Together, our results suggest that enhanced internalization by CXCL12-LD partial agonist signaling can avoid pharmacodynamic tolerance and may identify new avenues to better target GPCRs.">

        <tr id="Currently, only 20-40% of cancer patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and characterizing dynamic changes in the immunological landscape during treatment are critical for improving responsiveness to immunotherapy. Here, we identified JNK signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a regulator of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bladder cancer treated with a JNK inhibitor revealed enhanced cytotoxicity and effector functions of CD8+ T cells. In untreated tumors, CAFs interacted frequently with CD8+ T cells and mediated their exhaustion. JNK inhibition abrogated the immunosuppression function of CAFs by downregulating the expression of TSLP, thereby restoring CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In addition, blockade of CAF-derived TSLP in combination with anti-PD1 treatment promoted tumor elimination by CD8+ T cells in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that JNK signaling plays an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment by promoting expression of TSLP in CAFs and suggest that inhibiting JNK signaling could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="T cell accumulation within the aorta promotes endothelial dysfunction and the genesis of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Viral infection during pregnancy is also known to mediate marked acute endothelial dysfunction, but it is not clear whether T cells are recruited to the aorta and whether the dysfunction persists post-partum. Here, we demonstrate that influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy in a murine model resulted in endothelial dysfunction of the aorta, which persisted for up to 60 days post-infection and was associated with higher levels of IFN-g mRNA expression within the tissue. In the absence of infection, low numbers of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, central memory T cells and effector memory T cells were observed in the aorta. However, with IAV infection these T cell subsets were significantly increased with a notable accumulation of IAV-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells. Critically, this increase was maintained out to at least 60 days. In contrast, IAV infection in non-pregnant female mice resulted in modest endothelial dysfunction with no accumulation of T cells within the aorta. These data therefore demonstrate that the aorta is a site of T cell recruitment and retention after IAV infection during pregnancy. Whilst IAV-specific memory T cells could theoretically confer protection against future influenza infection, non-specific memory T cell activation and IFN-g production in the aorta could also contribute to future endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prototypical autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to CD4+ T cells, memory B cells are now recognized as a critical cell type in the disease. This is underlined by the fact that the best-characterized environmental risk factor for MS is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can infect and persist in memory B cells throughout life. Several studies have identified changes in anti-EBV immunity in patients with MS. Examples include elevated titers of anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibodies, interactions of these with the MS-associated HLA-DR15 haplotype, and molecular mimicry with MS autoantigens like myelin basic protein (MBP), anoctamin-2 (ANO2), glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM), and alpha-crystallin B (CRYAB). In this study, we employ a simple in vitro assay to examine the memory B cell antibody repertoire in MS patients and healthy controls. We replicate previous serological data from MS patients demonstrating an increased secretion of anti-EBNA1380-641 IgG in cell culture supernatants, as well as a positive correlation of these levels with autoantibodies against GlialCAM262-416 and ANO21-275. For EBNA1380-641 and ANO21-275, we provide additional evidence suggesting antibody cross-reactivity between the two targets. Further, we show that two efficacious MS treatments – natalizumab (NAT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) – are associated with distinct changes in the EBNA1-directed B cell response and that these alterations can be attributed to the unique mechanisms of action of these therapies. Using an in vitro system, our study confirms MS-associated changes in the anti-EBNA1 memory B cell response, EBNA1380-641 antibody cross-reactivity with ANO21-275, and reveals treatment-associated changes in the immunoglobulin repertoire in MS.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with unclear pathogenesis and no effective treatments. We aimed to investigate a novel mechanistic theory and treat HAM patients with rituximab, which can deplete CD20+ B lymphocytes in circulation.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was analyzed to identify HTLV-1-associated B cells and their effect on T cells. An observational analysis of our HAM cohort was conducted to elucidate changes in the immunological microenvironment of these patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HAM patients were isolated to explore the efficacy of B cell depletion in vitro. To assess the effect of B-cell depletion on HAM patients, eligible participants in our cohort received rituximab therapy (NCT04004819).


RESULTS
ScRNA-seq results suggest a significant effect of HTLV-1-associated B cells on T cells. Additionally, HTLV-1 was found to infect B cells and depletion of B cells inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Number of B cells in HAM patients had positive correlation with the proviral load and infected cell counts. Depletion of B cells led to a reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load in vitro. Furthermore, in clinical trial, 14 HAM patients were enrolled. Three patients (21.4%) who received rituximab failed to achieve remission, compared to 24 (85.7%) patients received any other therapy that failed to achieve remission. With a low level of circulating B cells, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in CD4+ T cells fell.


INTERPRETATION
This study provided evidence that depleting B-lymphocytes is an innovative strategy for treating patients with HAM and broadens the understanding of the role of B cells in infectious immunity.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Lung cancer remains a major global health threat due to its complex microenvironment, particularly the role of neutrophils, which are crucial for tumor development and immune evasion mechanisms. This study aimed to delve into the impact of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil functions and their potential implications for lung cancer progression.


METHODS
Employing in vitro experimental models, this study has analyzed the effects of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil IL-8 and IFN-γ secretion, apoptosis, PD-L1 expression, and T-cell proliferation by using techniques, such as ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and CFSE proliferation assay. The roles of IL-8/PD-L1 in regulating neutrophil functions were further explored using inhibitors for IL-8 and PD-L1.


RESULTS
Lung cancer cell lines were found to secrete higher levels of IL-8 compared to normal lung epithelial cells. The conditioned media from lung cancer cells significantly reduced apoptosis in neutrophils, increased PD-L1 expression, and suppressed T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion. These effects were partially reversed in the presence of IL-8 inhibitors in Tumor Tissue Culture Supernatants (TTCS), while being further enhanced by IL-8. Both apoptosis and PD-L1 expression in neutrophils demonstrated dose-dependency to TTCS. Additionally, CFSE proliferation assay results further confirmed the inhibitory effect of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on T-cell proliferation.


CONCLUSION
This study has revealed lung cancer cell-conditioned media to modulate neutrophil functions through regulating factors, such as IL-8, thereby affecting immune regulation and tumor progression in the lung cancer microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in resistance to immunotherapy. In this study, we identified epidermal growth factor-like 6 (Egfl6) as a new regulator of myeloid cell functions. Our analyses indicated that Egfl6, via binding with β3 integrins and activation of p38 and SYK signaling, acts as a chemotactic factor for myeloid cells migration and promotes their differentiation towards an immunosuppressive state. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer (OvCa), tumor expression of Egfl6 increased the intra-tumoral accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSCs and TAMs and their expression of immunosuppressive factors, including CXCL2, IL-10 and PD-L1. Consistent with this, in an immune 'hot' tumor model, Egfl6 expression eliminated response to a-PD-L1 therapy, while Egfl6 neutralizing antibody decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and PMN-MDSCs and restored the efficacy of a-PD-L1 therapy. Supporting a role in human tumors, in human OvCa tissue samples, areas of high EGFL6 expression co-localized with myeloid cell infiltration. scRNAseq analyses revealed a correlation between EGFL6 and immune cell expression of immunosuppressive factors. Our data provide mechanistic insights into the onco-immunologic functions of EGFL6 in mediating tumor immune suppression and identified EGFL6 as a potential novel therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy in OvCa patients.">

        <tr id="One of major breakthroughs in immunotherapy against tumor is from blocking immune checkpoint molecules on tumor and reactive T cells. The development of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockage antibodies has triggered to search for additional effective therapeutic strategies. This causes recent findings that blocking the interaction of checkpoint molecule NKG2A in NK and CD8 T cells with HLA-E in tumors is effective in defensing tumors. Interestingly, gut microbiota also affects this immune checkpoint immunotherapy against tumor. Gut microbiota such as bacteria can contribute to the regulation of host immune response and homeostasis. They not only promote the differentiation and function of immunosuppressive cells but also the inflammatory cells through the metabolites such as tryptophan (Trp) and bile acid (BA) metabolites as well as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These gut microbiota metabolites (GMMs) educated immune cells can affect the differentiation and function of effective CD8 and NK cells. Notably, these metabolites also directly affect the activity of CD8 and NK cells. Furthermore, the expression of CD94/NKG2A in the immune cells and/or their ligand HLA-E in the tumor cells is also regulated by gut microbiota associated immune factors. These findings offer new insights for the clinical application of gut microbiota in precise and/or personalized treatments of tumors. In this review, we will discuss the impacts of GMMs and GMM educated immune cells on the activity of effective CD8 and NK cells and the expression of CD94/NKG2A in immune cells and/or their ligand HLA-E in tumor cells.">

Additionally, the UPS contributes to the remodeling of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) by regulating B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and Treg cells. Targeting the UPS in conjunction with immune checkpoint-associated proteins, and combining these with other therapeutic approaches, may significantly enhance the efficacy of combination therapies and pave the way for novel cancer treatment strategies. In this review, we first summarize the composition and alterations of the TIME, with a particular emphasis on the role of the UPS in TIME and its interactions with various immune cell types.

        <tr id="Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) greatly contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance of cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms and whether TAMs can be promising targets to overcome ICI resistance remain to be unveiled. Through integrative analysis of immune multiomics data and single‐cell RNA‐seq data (iMOS) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lymphotoxin β receptor (LTBR) is identified as a potential immune checkpoint of TAMs, whose high expression, duplication, and low methylation are correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

        <tr id="Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes a persistent infection in sensory ganglia. The infection manifests itself as genital herpes but in rare cases it can cause meningitis. In this study, we used a murine model of HSV-2 meningitis to show that Fas and FasL are induced within the CNS upon HSV-2 infection, both on resident microglia and astrocytes and on infiltrating monocytes and lymphocytes. Mice lacking Fas or FasL had a more severe disease development with significantly higher morbidity, mortality, and an overall higher CNS viral load. In parallel, these Fas/FasL-deficient mice showed a severely impaired infection-induced CNS inflammatory response with lower levels of infiltrating CD4+ T-cells, lower levels of Th1 cytokines and chemokines, and a shift in the balance between M1 and M2 microglia/monocytes. In vitro, we confirmed that Fas and FasL is required for the induction of leucocyte apoptosis, but also show that the Fas/FasL pathway is required for adequate cytokine and chemokine production by glial cells. In summary, our data show that the Fas/FasL cell death receptor pathway is an important defense mechanism in the spinal cord as it down-regulates HSV-2-induced inflammation while at the same time promoting adequate anti-viral immune responses against infection.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity enhances responsiveness of the innate immune system upon restimulation. Although adjuvants are used to enhance immune responses, we showed that repeated administration of alum, termed adjuvant conditioning (AC), establishes an immunosuppressive environment that delays allogeneic graft rejection by expanding myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we show that AC-induced MDSCs suppress antigen specific adaptive responses both in vitro and in vivo, and that the immunosuppression is abolished in the absence of NLRP3 and IL-1 signaling. Allogeneic pancreatic islets transplanted into AC-treated NLRP3-/- mice are not protected, demonstrating that AC requires NLRP3 signaling. Finally, AC also has an immunosuppressive effect on human cells. Overall, our data show that AC establishes an immunosuppressive milieu via the NLRP3/IL-1 axis, leading to trained immunosuppression, or trained tolerance. Our findings give a potent mandate to explore the possibility to target the NLRP3/IL-1 pathway as a new promising strategy to condition transplant recipients and promote allograft tolerance.">

        <tr id="Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by immune cell–rich granulomas that form in multiple organs. In this issue of the JCI, Sati and colleagues used scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics of skin samples from patients with sarcoidosis and non-sarcoidosis granulomatous disease to identify upregulation of a stromal-immune CXCL12/CXCR4 axis and accumulation of type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) in sarcoidosis. The accumulation of ILC1s in skin and blood was specific to patients with sarcoidosis and not observed in other granulomatous diseases. The authors used a mouse model of lung granuloma to show that ILCs contribute to granuloma formation and that blockade of CXCR4 reduced the formation of granulomas, providing a proof of concept that sarcoidosis may be treated by CXCR4 blockade to prevent the progression of disease in patients. These results suggest ILC1s could serve as a diagnostic biomarker in sarcoidosis and a potential therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) arising from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are prominent in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). We have previously shown that CAF formation is triggered by exposure to reactive oxygen species-inducing chemotherapy and that CAF support chemoresistance by donating mitochondria to the cancer cells, through tunnelling nanotubes. In the present study, we show that exposure of MSC to ALL cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary cells or their conditioned media can also trigger CAF formation. Using bulk RNA sequencing in cell lines, we show that the MSC to CAF transition is accompanied by a robust interferon pathway response and we have validated this finding in primary cells. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we identify the take-up of leukaemia cell-derived mitochondrial dsRNA by MSC as a proximate trigger for the MSC to CAF transition. We show that inhibition of dsRNA formation in ALL cells by treatment with low-dose ethidium or the mitochondrial transcription inhibitor IMT1 or degradation of dsRNA in conditioned media by 100°C exposure ablates the ability of the ALL conditioned media to stimulate MSC to CAF transition. Our data reveal a novel and previously undescribed mechanism by which cancer cells induce a CAF phenotype in stromal cells, showing how B-ALL cells can directly induce the previously described niche-mediated protection within the bone marrow.">

        <tr id="The activation of innate immunity and associated interferon (IFN) signaling have been implicated in cancer, but the regulators are elusive and a link to tumor suppression undetermined. Here, we found that Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase altered in Parkinson's Disease was epigenetically silenced in cancer and its re-expression by clinically approved demethylating therapy stimulated transcription of a potent IFN response in tumor cells. This pathway required Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, involved the subcellular trafficking and release of the alarmin High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and was associated with inhibition of NFκB gene expression. In turn, Parkin-expressing cells released an IFN secretome that upregulated effector and cytotoxic CD8 T cell markers, lowered the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, TIM3 and LAG3, and stimulated high content of the self-renewal/stem cell factor, TCF1. Parkin-induced CD8 T cells selectively accumulated in the microenvironment and inhibited transgenic and syngeneic tumor growth, in vivo. Therefore, Parkin is an epigenetically regulated activator of innate immunity and dual mode tumor suppressor, inhibiting intrinsic tumor traits of metabolism and cell invasion, while simultaneously reinvigorating CD8 T cell functions in the microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background
CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in immune responses, and have significant potential in tumor immunotherapy. The JAK/STAT pathway is essential for cytokine signal transduction and is linked to immune escape. However, its role in mediating CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immunity in renal cancer is not fully understood.


Objective
To study the mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and propose new possibilities for immunotherapy in patients with renal cancer.


Methods
CD8+ T cells from mouse spleens were sorted using immunomagnetic beads, and their purity was confirmed by flow cytometry. Proliferation was analyzed using CCK-8 and CFSE assays. Activation of CD8+ T cells was assessed through ELISA and Western blotting. The malignant properties of Renca cells were evaluated through flow cytometry, Calcein-AM/PI staining, wound healing, Transwell, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. A subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice was used to examine the role of JAK1/STAT1 pathway in vivo.


Results
Inhibitors of JAK1 and STAT1 significantly reduced the proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cell. Co-culture with CD8+ T cells increased apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Renca cells. The effects were diminished by JAK1 and STAT1 inhibitors, confirming that CD8+ T cells exert antitumor effects through the JAK1/STAT1 pathway. In vivo, inhibition of this pathway reduced the anti-tumor effects of CD8+ T cells.


Conclusion
Inhibitors of JAK1 and STAT1 weakened the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cells, suggesting that targeting this pathway could enhance CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity in renal cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract The ability of the skin to “remember” has been a potential mechanism for studying recurrent skin diseases. While it has been thought that the ability to retain past encounters is the prerogative of immune cells, it has recently been discovered that skin tissue stem cells can also take on this task. Epithelial stem cells undergoing inflammation retain their “memory” through epigenetic reprogramming and exhibit rapid epithelialization and epidermal proliferation upon secondary stimulation. This is a non-specific memory modality independent of conventional immune memory, in which histone modifications (acetylation and methylation) and specific transcription factors (AP-1 and STAT3) are involved in the establishment of inflammatory memories, and AIM2/Caspase-1/IL-1β mainly performs the rapid effects of memory. This finding is intriguing for addressing recurrent inflammatory skin diseases, which may explain the fixed-site recurrence of inflammatory skin diseases and develop new therapeutic strategies in the future. However, more research is still needed to decipher the mysteries of memory.">

In this study, we comprehensively characterized the NK cell repertoire in EC after long-term viral control. Phenotypic profiling of NK cells revealed profound differences compared with other PWH, but marked similarities to uninfected individuals, with a distinctive prevalence of NKG2C+CD57+memory-like NK cells. Functional analyses indicated that EC had limited production of functional molecules upon NK stimulation and consequently reduced natural cytotoxicity against non-HIV target cells. Importantly, EC showed an exceptional ability to kill primary HIV-infected cells by the antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) adaptive mechanism, which was achieved by a specific memory-like NK population expressing CD16, NKG2A, NKG2C, CD57 and CXCR3. In-depth single-cell RNA sequencing unveiled a unique transcriptional signature in these NK cells linked to increased cell metabolism, migration, chemotaxis, effector functions, cytokine secretion, and antiviral response. Our findings underscore a pivotal role of NK cells in the immune control of HIV and identify specific NK cells as emerging targets for immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="The use of antitumor drugs represents a reliable strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become increasingly common and contributes to tumor metastasis and local recurrence. The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) consists of immune cells, cytokines and immunomodulators, and collectively they influence the response to treatment. Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as increased drug exportation have been reported to contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancers. In the past few years, the majority of studies on tumors have only focused on the development and progression of a tumor from a mechanistic standpoint; few studies have examined whether the changes in the TME can also affect tumor growth and drug resistance. Recently, emerging evidence have raised more concerns regarding the role of TME in the development of drug resistance. In the present review, it was discussed how the suppressive TME adapts to drug resistance characterized by the cooperation of immune cells, cytokines, immunomodulators, stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was reviewed how these immunological or metabolic changes alter immuno-surveillance and thus facilitate tumor drug resistance. In addition, potential targets present in the TME for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve individualized therapy for cancer treatment were revealed.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumour cell senescence can be induced by various factors, including DNA damage, inflammatory signals, genetic toxins, ionising radiation and nutrient metabolism. The senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP), secreted by senescent tumour cells, possesses the capacity to modulate various immune cells, including macrophages, T cells, natural killer cells and myeloid‐derived suppressor cells, as well as vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts within the tumour microenvironment (TME), and this modulation can result in either the promotion or suppression of tumorigenesis and progression. Exploring the impact of SASP on the TME could identify potential therapeutic targets, yet limited studies have dissected its functions. In this review, we delve into the causes and mechanisms of tumour cell senescence. We then concentrate on the influence of SASP on the tumour immune microenvironment, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix and the reprogramming of cancer stem cells, along with their associated tumour outcomes. Last, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse array of senotherapeutics, highlighting their prospective advantages and challenge for the treatment of cancer patients. Key points Senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion from senescent tumour cells significantly impacts cancer progression and biology. SASP is involved in regulating the remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, including immune microenvironment, vascular, extracellular matrix and cancer stem cells.

        <tr id="Since their conception with the smallpox vaccine, vaccines used worldwide have mitigated multiple pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Insightful studies have uncovered the complexities of different functional networks of CD4 T cells (T helper 1 (Th1); Th2, Th17) and CD8 T cells (T cytotoxic; Tc), as well as B cell (BIgM, BIgG, BIgA and BIgE) subsets, during the response to vaccination. Both T and B cell subsets form central, peripheral, and tissue-resident subsets during vaccination. It has also become apparent that each vaccination forms a network of T regulatory subsets, namely CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells and interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD4+ Foxp3− T regulatory 1 (Tr1), as well as many others, which shape the quality/quantity of vaccine-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody production. These components are especially critical for immunocompromised patients, such as older individuals and allograft recipients, as their vaccination may be ineffective or less effective. This review focuses on considering how the pre- and post-vaccination Treg/Tr1 levels influence the vaccination efficacy. Experimental and clinical work has revealed that Treg/Tr1 involvement evokes different immune mechanisms in diminishing vaccine-induced cellular/humoral responses. Alternative steps may be considered to improve the vaccination response, such as increasing the dose, changing the delivery route, and/or repeated booster doses of vaccines. Vaccination may be combined with anti-CD25 (IL-2Rα chain) or anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to decrease the Tregs and boost the T/B cell immune response. All of these data and strategies for immunizations are presented and discussed, aiming to improve the efficacy of vaccination in humans and especially in immunocompromised and older individuals, as well as organ transplant patients.">

Resistance to BCMA-targeting therapies, nonetheless, remains a significant challenge. BCMA shedding by gamma-secretase is a known resistance mechanism, and preclinical studies suggest that inhibition may improve anti-BCMA therapy. Leveraging a phase I clinical trial of the gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), crenigacestat, with anti-BCMA CAR T-cells (FCARH143), we utilized single-nuclei RNA sequencing and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) sequencing to characterize the effects of GSI on the tumor microenvironment. The most significant impacts of GSI involved effects on monocytes, which are known to promote tumor growth. In addition to observing a reduction in the frequency of non-classical monocytes, we also detected significant changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and inferred cell-cell interactions following exposure to GSI. Although many genes with altered expression are associated with gamma-secretase-dependent signaling, such as Notch, other pathways were affected, indicating GSI has far-reaching effects. Finally, we detected monoallelic deletion of the BCMA locus in some patients with prior exposure to anti-BCMA therapy, which significantly correlated with reduced progression-free survival (median PFS 57 days versus 861 days). GSIs are being explored in combination with the full spectrum of BCMA targeting agents, and our results reveal widespread effects of GSI on both tumor and immune cell populations, providing insight into mechanisms for enhancing BCMA-directed therapies.">

 Immunotherapy has had very limited success in pancreatic cancer, due to its low mutational burden and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our approach consists in redirecting pre- existing antiviral immunity against pancreatic tumors by delivering viral antigens using the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD .This peptide, targets the tumor vasculature through av integrins and neuropilin-1, delivering conjugated or co-administered cargo to tumors. Here we used mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) as an infection model. CMV is a β-herpesvirus that induces a strong T-cell response in mice and humans, comprising >10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells mostly with effector-memory phenotype. Importantly, human CMV infects over 60% of the world’s population rendering it a suitable candidate for translation. Methods: Mice latently infected with CMV were orthotopically implanted with KPC pancreatic tumor cells and treated with systemic injections of vehicle or iRGD plus CMV class I and II binding peptides. Another cohort of age matched uninfected mice was used as a control. Tumor growth and mouse weight were monitored twice a week and CMV specific immune responses were measured in spleen, liver and tumor by flow cytometry, using tetramer staining and CMV specific peptide recall. Results: CMV infected mice receiving iRGD+CMV peptides responded to treatment as evidenced by delayed tumor growth associated with increased tumor necrosis and T cell infiltration. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of tumor, liver and spleen showed a significant increase in CMV specific T cells preferentially in the tumor. Surprisingly, these T cells preferentially infiltrated tumors regardless of the use of iRGD for tumor targeting of CMV peptides. Survival studies showed a marked increase in median survival, reaching 42 days in the infected and treated group, compared to 25 days in the vehicle treated one. The survival benefit was very similar in the presence or absence of iRGD. Combining this strategy with anti- PD1 and or anti-IL10R did not significantly improve the benefits of CMV therapy alone. On the other hand, combination with low dose gemcitabine (5mg/kg) significantly improved tumor growth delay and survival in the combination compared to either therapy alone. The median survival reached 49 days in the combination, compared to 39 for gemcitabine or CMV therapy alone and 32 for vehicle.Conclusions: We have recently performed single cell RNA sequencing in tumors from infected and CMV peptide or vehicle treated mice and will analyze the transcriptional profile and TCR sequence of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary analysis of this data shows a massive T cell infiltration and an increase in dendritic cells and macrophages in infected and treated mice. Taken together, this data shows we can deliver antigens to pancreatic tumors and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that results in delayed tumor growth and has a survival benefit. This is a mutation agnostic approach with high translational value, since more than 60% of the population has previous CMV immunity.

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells play a critical role in cancer immune-surveillance and pathogen elimination. However, their effector function can be severely impaired by inhibitory receptors such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3). Here Siglec-G is identified as a coinhibitory receptor that limits CD8+ T cell function. Siglec-G is highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating T cells and is enriched in the exhausted T cell subset. Ablation of Siglec-G enhances the efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in suppressing solid tumors growth. Mechanistically, sialoglycan ligands, such as CD24 on tumor cells, activate the Siglec-G-SHP2 axis in CD8+ T cells, impairing metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which dampens cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity. These findings discover a critical role for Siglec-G in inhibiting CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting its potential therapeutic effect in adoptive T cell therapy and tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Many chronic inflammatory diseases are attributed to disturbances in host-microbe interactions, which drive immune-mediated tissue damage. Depending on the anatomic setting, a chronic inflammatory disease can exert unique local and systemic influences, which provide an exceptional opportunity for understanding disease mechanism and testing therapeutic interventions. The oral cavity is an easily accessible environment that allows for protective interventions aiming at modulating the immune response to control disease processes driven by a breakdown of host-microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger nonresolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss, and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional, or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment up-regulated M2-macrophage and downregulated proinflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2-treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host-microbe homeostasis.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a survival rate under 12%. Treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy are ineffective in PDAC due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, in which tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are a major component. TAN immunosuppression has been shown to depend upon increased production of reactive oxygen species, with myeloperoxidase (MPO) being a major source of it. We investigated the contribution of MPO in mediating TAN immunosuppression using orthotopic PDAC models in wild-type and syngeneic MPO-deficient mice. We observed a significant delay in tumor growth and improved clinical scores when MPO was deficient. Additionally, treatment with the MPO-specific inhibitor Verdiperstat also delayed tumor growth. Flow cytometry analysis of the tumor microenvironment further confirmed a significant increase in CD8 T and NK cells, along with an increase in granzyme B level in both subsets, when MPO was deficient. Additionally, there was an increase in activation marker (CD25) and memory subset among both CD8 and CD4 T cells in MPO-deficient mice. Ex vivo studies with isolated TANs from tumor-bearing mice showed reduced CD8 T and NK cell suppression, and reactive oxygen species level in absence of MPO, supporting the contribution of MPO in TAN immunosuppression. These data suggest that loss of MPO in TANs has decreased immunosuppressive functions resulting in increased cytotoxic and activated T cells and NK cells with increased memory response within the tumor microenvironment. Our results demonstrate the contribution of MPO in regulating tumor progression, TAN immunosuppression, and immune cell infiltration using an orthotopic PDAC model.

It is involved in many biological events, such as cell survival, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and cell migration, and has been widely studied in malignant diseases. However, recent studies have shown that PIM1 plays a prominent role in immunoinflammatory diseases, including autoimmune uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. PIM1 can function in inflammatory signal transduction by phosphorylating multiple inflammatory protein substrates and mediating macrophage activation and T lymphocyte cell specification, thus participating in the development of multiple immunoinflammatory diseases. Moreover, the inhibition of PIM1 has been demonstrated to ameliorate certain immunoinflammatory disorders. Based on these studies, we suggest PIM1 as a potential therapeutic target for immunoinflammatory diseases and a valid candidate for future research. Herein, for the first time, we provide a detailed review that focuses on the roles of PIM1 in the pathogenesis of immunoinflammatory diseases.">

Pharmacological inhibition as well as the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor hindered memory transition and limited the homeostatic turnover of the activated CD8+ T cells. Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, controlled glucocorticoid signaling within the effector CD8+ T cells is crucial for optimal memory differentiation.">

        <tr id="Maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and preventing harmful autoimmune reactions is a fundamental task of the immune system. However, these essential functions are significantly compromised during autoimmune disorders, creating a major challenge in treating these conditions. In this context, we provide an overview of research on small spleen polypeptides (SSPs) that naturally regulate peripheral immune tolerance. Alongside outlining the observed effects of SSPs, we summarize here the findings on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie their regulatory impact. Specifically, SSPs have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in halting the progression of developing or established autoimmune disorders like psoriasis or arthritis in animal models. They primarily target dendritic cells (DCs), swiftly prompting the production of extracellular ATP, which is then degraded and sensed by adenosine receptors. This process triggers the mTOR signaling cascade, similar to powerful immune triggers, but instead of a rapid and intense reaction, it leads to a moderate yet significant activation of the mTOR signaling cascade. This induces a tolerogenic state in dendritic cells, ultimately leading to the generation of Foxp3+ immunosuppressor Treg cells. In addition, SSPs may indirectly attenuate the autoimmune response by reducing extracellular ATP synthesis in non-immune cells, such as endothelial cells, when exposed to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. SSPs thus have the potential to contribute to the restoration of peripheral immune tolerance and may offer valuable therapeutic benefits in treating autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background: Exosomal programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), an exosomal membrane protein found in many tumor types, is reckoned to help regulate the immune microenvironment. However, the functions and the mechanisms underlying the exosome-mediated regulation of the immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown. Methods: Western blotting was used to investigate the levels of exosomal PD-L1 in the peripheral blood of patients with CRC and healthy controls. A CRC mouse model was constructed by administering 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) and dextrane sodium sulfate (DSS) intraperitoneally. The mice were then administered the control or CRC-derived exosomes to examine the regulatory effect of the exosomes on macrophage infiltration and CRC development. In vitro studies, using a coculture system, and flow cytometry analysis were conducted to examine the relationship between the regulatory effect of CRC-derived exosomes on CD4+ T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. RNA-seq and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulatory effect of the CRC-derived exosomes on macrophage proliferation and the regulation of the immune microenvironment during CRC development. Results: In patients with CRC, higher levels of exosomal PD-L1 were associated with a more severe form of disease. The treatment of mice with AOM/DSS-induced CRC with CRC-derived exosomes resulted in high levels of macrophage proliferation, increased PD-L1 levels in macrophages, and accelerated CRC progression. Importantly, analysis of an in vitro coculture system and flow cytometry analysis showed that the CRC-derived exosomes transported PD-L1 into macrophages and impaired CD4+ T cell function. Preliminary data suggest that the NF-κb signaling pathway regulates the function of CRC-derived exosomal PD-L1-dependent macrophages. Conclusion: CRC-derived exosomes induce the proliferation of macrophages and increase their PD-L1 levels. They also impair CD4+ T cell function and promote CRC progression. Our findings reveal a novel exosomal PD-L1-mediated crosstalk between the CRC cells and immune cells in the CRC microenvironment.">

Here, using a 3D co-culture system based on human intestinal epithelial organoids, we explore the capacity of IFNγ-exposure to reprogram intestinal epithelia and thereby directly modulate lymphocyte responses. IFNγ treatment of organoids led to transcriptional reprogramming, marked by a switch to a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, including transcriptional upregulation of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Proteomic analysis of organoid-conditioned medium post-treatment confirmed chemokine secretion. IFNγ-treatment of organoids led to enhanced T cell migration in a CXCL11-dependent manner without affecting T cell activation status. Taken together, our results suggest a specific role for CXCL11 in T cell recruitment that could be targeted to prevent T cell trafficking to the inflamed intestine.">

        <tr id="The maintenance of intestinal homeostasis depends on a complex interaction between the immune system, intestinal epithelial barrier, and microbiota. Alteration in one of these components could lead to the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Variants within the autophagy gene ATG16L1 have been implicated in susceptibility and severity of Crohn’s disease (CD). Individuals carrying the risk ATG16L1 T300A variant have higher caspase 3-dependent degradation of ATG16L1 resulting in impaired autophagy and increased cellular stress. ATG16L1-deficiency induces enhanced IL-1β secretion in dendritic cells in response to bacterial infection. Infection of ATG16L1-deficient mice with a persistent strain of murine norovirus renders these mice highly susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium colitis. Moreover, persistent norovirus infection leads to intestinal virus specific CD8+ T cells responses. Both Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which recognizes single-stranded RNA viruses, and ATG16L1, which facilitates the delivery of viral nucleic acids to the autolysosome endosome, are required for anti-viral immune responses.However, the role of the enteric virome in IBD is still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of TLR7 and ATG16L1 in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. At steady state, Tlr7-/- mice have a significant increase in large intestinal lamina propria (LP) granzyme B+ tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells compared to WT mice, reminiscent of persistent norovirus infection. Deletion of Atg16l1 in myeloid (Atg16l1ΔLyz2) or dendritic cells (Atg16l1ΔCd11c) leads to a similar increase of LP TRM. Furthermore, Tlr7-/- and Atg16l1ΔCd11c mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium colitis with an increase in disease activity index, histoscore, and increased secretion of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Treatment of Atg16l1ΔCd11c mice with the TLR7 agonist Imiquimod attenuated colonic inflammation in these mice. Our data demonstrate that ATG16L1-deficiency in myeloid and dendritic cells leads to an increase in LP TRM and consequently to increased susceptibility to colitis by impairing the recognition of enteric viruses by TLR7.In conclusion, the convergence of ATG16L1 and TLR7 signaling pathways plays an important role in the immune response to intestinal viruses. Our data suggest that activation of the TLR7 signaling pathway could be an attractive therapeutic target for CD patients with ATG16L1 risk variants.">

        <tr id="The thymus plays a pivotal role in generating a highly-diverse repertoire of T lymphocytes while preventing autoimmunity. Thymus seeding progenitors (TSPs) are a heterogeneous group of multipotent progenitors that migrate to the thymus via CCR7 and CCR9 receptors. While NOTCH guides thymus progenitors toward T cell fate, the absence or disruption of NOTCH signaling renders the thymus microenvironment permissive to other cell fates. Following T cell commitment, developing T cells undergo multiple selection checkpoints by engaging with the extracellular matrix, and interacting with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and other immune subsets across the different compartments of the thymus. The different selection checkpoints assess the T cell receptor (TCR) performance, with failure resulting in either repurposing (agonist selection), or cell death. Additionally, environmental cues such as inflammation and endocrine signaling induce acute thymus atrophy, contributing to the demise of most developing T cells during thymic selection. We discuss the occurrence of acute thymus atrophy in response to systemic inflammation. The thymus demonstrates high plasticity, shaping inflammation by abrogating T cell development and undergoing profound structural changes, and facilitating regeneration and restoration of T cell development once inflammation is resolved. Despite the challenges, thymic selection ensures a highly diverse T cell repertoire capable of discerning between self and non-self antigens, ultimately egressing to secondary lymphoid organs where they complete their maturation and exert their functions.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells, integral components of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in the protection against intracellular threats. Their cytotoxic power requires that activation is tightly controlled, and in this, they take a unique position within the immune system. Rather than depending on the engagement of a single activating receptor, their activation involves a delicate balance between inhibitory and activating signals mediated through an array of surface molecules. Only when this cumulative balance surpasses a specific threshold do NK cells initiate their activity. Remarkably, the activation threshold of NK cells remains robust even when cells express vastly different repertoires of inhibitory and activating receptors. These threshold values seem to be influenced by NK cell interactions with their environment during development and after release from the bone marrow. Understanding how NK cells integrate this intricate pattern of stimuli is an ongoing area of research, particularly relevant for cellular therapies seeking to harness the anti-cancer potential of these cells by modifying surface receptor expression.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has quickly risen to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer- related death. This is in part due to its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here we investigated an innovative immunotherapy approach combining delivery of STING and TLR4 innate immune agonists via lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) co-encapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies that can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory signaling, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell-driven and Type I interferon-mediated tumor regressions and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models dependent on both tumor and host STING activation. STING and TLR4-mediated Type I interferon signaling were also associated with enhanced NK and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can synergize to orchestrate a coordinated Type I interferon-driven innate and adaptive immune assault to overcome immune suppression and activate durable anti-tumor T cell responses against PDAC.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Growing evidence highlights the pivotal role of RORγt-innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the establishment of antitumor immune response and in enhancing tumor sensitivity to immunotherapy. Noteworthy, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) have been recently acknowledged as an important class of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the context of host–microorganism interactions shaping the adaptive immune response in the intestinal mucosa. Although a broad range of mouse models has led to significant progress in untangling the role of ILC3s as APCs, the outcome of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent ILC-T cell crosstalk in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains underexplored in human. Moreover, expression of MHCII is confined to ILC3 subset, endowed with lymphoid tissue-inducing properties, that adopts tissue-specific fates and functions. Intestinal microbiota could dictate the plasticity of antigen-presenting ILC3s and we here summarize our current understanding of the functions of these cells in both mouse and human CRC discussing the role of microbiota as a key modulator of their tumor-suppressive activity.">

 Introduction: The prostate cancer (PCa) microenvironment plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses, potentially impacting disease progression and treatment outcomes. SPDEF, a transcription factor, has been implicated in PCa progression, yet its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment remains incompletely understood. Methods: To comprehensively evaluate the impact of SPDEF-mediated changes in the PCa microenvironment on immune cells, we employed multiple experimental approaches. Firstly, utilizing the ProcartaPlex Human Cytokine & Chemokine Panel 1 16plex assay, we analyzed cytokine and chemokine alterations in cell culture supernatants from various PCa cell line models—PC3-VC, PC3-SPDEF, RC77/T-VC, RC77/T-SPDEF, LNCaP-VC, and LNCaP-shSPDEF. Subsequently, human primary T cells were exposed to PCa cell-derived conditioned media to assess their proliferation and activation status, using IncuCyte cell imaging and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Our ProcartaPlex assay validated transcriptomic observations from RNA-seq experiment, confirming elevated cytokine/chemokine levels in SPDEF-overexpressing models and decreased levels in SPDEF-suppressed conditions. Notably, T cell proliferation assays demonstrated increased proliferation in response to SPDEF-overexpressing PCa conditional media and diminished proliferation in SPDEF-suppressed conditions. Moreover, SPDEF downregulation led to decreased proliferation in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Assessing CD8+ T cell activation markers revealed varying impacts on IFN-γ expression, showing reduced levels in LNCaP-shSPDEF but inconclusive effects in PC3-SPDEF overexpression models. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay between SPDEF alterations in the PCa microenvironment and immune cell behavior, particularly T cell proliferation and activation. The observed effects underscore the complexity of SPDEF-mediated alterations on immune responses within the tumor milieu. Further investigations into the divergent effects of SPDEF on T cell dynamics are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms governing these interactions, potentially offering insights into novel therapeutic targets for PCa.

        <tr id="Overexpression and aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) contribute to tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and tumor-immune evasion, making it a potential cancer therapeutic target. BP1003 is a neutral liposome incorporated with a nuclease-resistant P-ethoxy antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) targeting the STAT3 mRNA. Its unique design enhances BP1003 stability, cellular uptake, and target affinity. BP1003 efficiently reduces STAT3 expression and enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer cells (HER2+, triple negative) and ovarian cancer cells (late stage, invasive ovarian cancer) to paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in both 2D and 3D cell cultures. Similarly, ex vivo and in vivo patient-derived models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) show reduced tissue viability and tumor volume with BP1003 and gemcitabine combination treatments. In addition to directly affecting tumor cells, BP1003 can modulate the tumor microenvironment. Unlike M1 differentiation, monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages is suppressed by BP1003, indicating its potential contribution to immunotherapy. The broad anti-tumor effect of BP1003 in numerous preclinical solid tumor models, such as breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer models shown in this work, makes it a promising cancer therapeutic.">

        <tr id="Antigen-specific humoral responses are orchestrated through complex interactions among immune cells in lymphoid tissues, including the collaboration between B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Accumulating evidence indicates a crucial role for interleukin-9 (IL-9) in the formation of germinal centers (GCs), enhancing the generation of class-switched high-affinity antibodies. However, the exact function of IL-9 in Tfh cell regulation remains unclear. In this study, we examined the humoral immune responses of CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice, which lack an IL-9-specific receptor in Tfh cells. Upon intraperitoneal immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice displayed diminished levels of SRBC-specific IgG antibodies in their sera, along with reduced levels of GC B cells and plasma cells. Notably, Il9ra-deficient Tfh cells in the spleen exhibited decreased expression of their signature molecules such as B-cell lymphoma 6, C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, IL-4, and IL-21 compared to control mice. In models of allergic asthma induced by house dust mite (HDM) inhalation, CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice failed to elevate serum levels of HDM-specific IgE and IgG. This was accompanied by reductions in Tfh cells, GC B cells, and plasma cells in mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were identified as producers of IL-9 under immunizing conditions, possibly induced by leukotrienes released by activated IgD+ B cells around the T-B border. These observations may indicate the critical role of IL-9 receptor signaling in the activation of Tfh cells, with ILC2s potentially capable of supplying IL-9 in organized lymphoid tissues.">

        <tr id="Age-related changes in the immune system, referred to as immunosenescence, appear to evolve with rather paradoxical manifestations, a diminished adaptive immune capacity, and an increased propensity for chronic inflammation often with autoimmunity, which may underlie the development of diverse disorders with age. Immunosenescent phenotypes are associated with the emergence of unique lymphocyte subpopulations of both T and B lineages. We report that a CD153+ PD-1+ CD4+ T-cell subpopulation with severely attenuated T-cell receptor (TCR)-responsiveness, termed senescence-associated T (SAT) cells, co-evolve with potentially autoreactive CD30+ B cells, such as spontaneous germinal center B cells and age-associated B cells, in aging mice. SAT cells and CD30+ B cells are reciprocally activated with the aid of the interaction of CD153 with CD30 in trans and with the TCR complex in cis, resulting in the restoration of TCR-mediated proliferation and secretion of abundant proinflammatory cytokines in SAT cells and the activation and production of autoantibodies by CD30+ B cells. Besides normal aging, the development of SAT cells coupled with counterpart B cells may be robustly accelerated and accumulated in the relevant tissues of lymphoid or extra-lymphoid organs under chronic inflammatory conditions including autoimmunity and may contribute to the pathogenesis and aggravation of the disorders. This review summarizes and discusses recent advances in the understanding of SAT cells in the contexts of immunosenescent phenotypes, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases and provides a novel therapeutic clue.">

This review deeply discussed the molecular mechanism of MMT, clarified crucial signal pathways, multiple cytokines, and growth factors, and formed a complex regulatory network. Significantly, the critical role of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and its downstream signaling pathways in this process were clarified. Furthermore, we discussed the significance of MMT in physiological and pathological conditions, such as pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac fibrosis.

In this longitudinal study, we analyzed the capacity of ponatinib to induce an antiviral response against HIV-1 infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from people with CML previously treated with imatinib for a median of 10 years who changed to ponatinib for 12 months to boost the anticancer response before discontinuing any TKI as part of the clinical trial NCT04043676. Participants were followed-up for an additional 12 months in the absence of treatment. PBMCs were obtained at different time points and then infected in vitro with HIV-1. The rate of infection was determined by quantifying the intracellular levels of p24-gag in CD4+ T cells. The levels of p24-gag+ CD4+ T−cells were lower when these cells were obtained during and after treatment with ponatinib in comparison with those obtained during treatment with imatinib. Cytotoxicity of PBMCs against HIV-infected target cells was significantly higher during treatment with ponatinib than during treatment with imatinib, and it was maintained at least 12 months after discontinuation. There was a significant negative correlation between the lower levels of p24-gag+ CD4+ T−cells and the higher cytotoxicity induced by PBMCs when cells were obtained during and after treatment with ponatinib. This cytotoxic immunity was mostly based on higher levels of Natural Killer and Tγδ cells seemingly boosted by ponatinib. In conclusion, transient treatment with immunomodulators like ponatinib along with ART could be explored to boost the antiviral activity of cytotoxic cells and contribute to the elimination of HIV-1 reservoir.">

        <tr id="An oral Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) with wild-type S. Typhi was re-established allowing us to explore the development of immunity. In this model, ~55% of volunteers who received the challenge reached typhoid diagnosis criteria (TD), while ~45% did not (NoTD). Intestinal macrophages are one of the first lines of defense against enteric pathogens. Most organs have self-renewing macrophages derived from tissue-resident progenitor cells seeded during the embryonic stage; however, the gut lacks these progenitors, and all intestinal macrophages are derived from circulating monocytes. After infecting gut-associated lymphoid tissues underlying microfold (M) cells, S. Typhi causes a primary bacteremia seeding organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Following days of incubation, a second bacteremia and clinical disease ensue. S. Typhi likely interacts with circulating monocytes or their progenitors in the bone marrow. We assessed changes in circulating monocytes after CHIM. The timepoints studied included 0 hours (pre-challenge) and days 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 14, 21 and 28 after challenge. TD participants provided extra samples at the time of typhoid diagnosis, and 48-96 hours later (referred as ToD). We report changes in Classical Monocytes -CM-, Intermediate Monocytes -IM- and Non-classical Monocytes -NCM-. Changes in monocyte activation markers were identified only in TD participants and during ToD. CM and IM upregulated molecules related to interaction with bacterial antigens (TLR4, TLR5, CD36 and CD206). Of importance, CM and IM showed enhanced binding of S. Typhi. Upregulation of inflammatory molecules like TNF-α were detected, but mechanisms involved in limiting inflammation were also activated (CD163 and CD354 downregulation). CM upregulated molecules to interact/modulate cells of the adaptive immunity, including T cells (HLA-DR, CD274 and CD86) and B cells (CD257). Both CM and IM showed potential to migrate to the gut as integrin α4β7 was upregulated. Unsupervised analysis revealed 7 dynamic cell clusters. Five of these belonged to CM showing that this is the main population activated during ToD. Overall, we provide new insights into the changes that diverse circulating monocyte subsets undergo after typhoid diagnosis, which might be important to control this disease since these cells will ultimately become intestinal macrophages once they reach the gut.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells, the “superstar” of the immune system, play a crucial role in antitumor immunity. T‐cell receptors (TCR) are crucial molecules that enable T cells to identify antigens and start immunological responses. The body has evolved a unique method for rearrangement, resulting in a vast diversity of TCR repertoires. A healthy TCR repertoire is essential for the particular identification of antigens by T cells. Methods In this article, we systematically summarized the TCR creation mechanisms and analysis methodologies, particularly focusing on the application of next‐generation sequencing (NGS) technology. We explore the TCR repertoire in health and cancer, and discuss the implications of TCR repertoire analysis in understanding carcinogenesis, cancer progression, and treatment. Results The TCR repertoire analysis has enormous potential for monitoring the emergence and progression of malignancies, as well as assessing therapy response and prognosis. The application of NGS has dramatically accelerated our comprehension of TCR diversity and its role in cancer immunity. Conclusions To substantiate the significance of TCR repertoires as biomarkers, more thorough and exhaustive research should be conducted. The TCR repertoire analysis, enabled by advanced sequencing technologies, is poised to become a crucial tool in the future of cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy evaluation.">

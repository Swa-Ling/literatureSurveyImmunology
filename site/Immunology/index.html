        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The gut microbiota crucially regulates the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear at the single-cell resolution. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent validations, we investigate gut microbiota-ICI synergy by profiling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and elucidating critical cellular interactions in mouse models. Our findings reveal that intact gut microbiota combined with ICIs may synergistically increase the proportions of CD8+, CD4+, and γδ T cells, reduce glycolysis metabolism, and reverse exhausted CD8+ T cells into memory/effector CD8+ T cells, enhancing antitumor response. This synergistic effect also induces macrophage reprogramming from M2 protumor Spp1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to Cd74+ TAMs, which act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These macrophage subtypes show a negative correlation within tumors, particularly during fecal microbiota transplantation. Depleting Spp1+ TAMs in Spp1 conditional knockout mice boosts ICI efficacy and T cell infiltration, regardless of gut microbiota status, suggesting a potential upstream role of the gut microbiota and highlighting the crucial negative impact of Spp1+ TAMs during macrophage reprogramming on immunotherapy outcomes. Mechanistically, we propose a γδ T cell-APC-CD8+ T cell axis, where gut microbiota and ICIs enhance Cd40lg expression on γδ T cells, activating Cd40 overexpressing APCs (e.g., Cd74+ TAMs) through CD40-CD40L-related NF-κB signaling and boosting CD8+ T cell responses via CD86-CD28 interactions. These findings highlight the potential importance of γδ T cells and SPP1-related macrophage reprogramming in activating CD8+ T cells, as well as the synergistic effect of gut microbiota and ICIs in immunotherapy through modulating the TME.">

        <tr id="Preserving barrier integrity is of great importance in mucosal tissues while simultaneously defending against inflammatory threats and exposures to pathogens. NK cells at barrier sites are essential for viral control during infections such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but must also balance pathogen response with tissue protection. We have characterized human tissue NK cells in the vaginal tissue (VT) as having distinct effector and tissue protective functions. Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection. Our data, using both human tissues and a mouse model, reveal an unexpected role of mucosal tissue NK cells in the VT in balancing host protection with tissue repair in the context of localized mucosal tissue infection.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="Background. Immunotherapy is efficacious in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the benefits are limited to a minority of patients. Most HCC patients show resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), potent immune stimulators, showed limited effectiveness. Using preclinical models, we studied the mechanisms of resistance to ICB and STING agonism. Methods. Murine HCA-1 and RIL-175 HCCs were orthotopically grown in mice with underlying liver fibrosis, to mimic the presentation of human HCC. Established tumors were treated with a STING agonist (BMS-986301) or anti-PD1 ICB, and mice were followed to evaluate safety and efficacy, as well as the mechanisms of treatment resistance by RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, B-cell depletion and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) ICB. Results. Unbiased analyses of transcriptomic data from murine HCC tissues from ICB-treated mice showed an increased abundance of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and B cells. STING agonism alone showed efficacy in the ICB-responsive RIL-175 HCC model but more limited efficacy in the ICB-resistant HCA-1 model. STING agonism increased circulating IL-10 and intratumoral infiltration by B-cells, including TIM-1+ B cells, and promoted the formation of tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS)-like structures, especially in the peritumoral areas. Strikingly, adding B cell depletion to ICB or STING agonism treatment significantly increased survival. Interestingly, unlike ICB, STING agonism also had a pronounced anti-metastatic activity. In addition, the combination of STING agonism and TIM-1 blockade augmented B cell differentiation and antigen presentation in vitro and improved the anti-tumor effects in murine HCC in vivo. This approach decreased the number of TIM-1+ B cells in the tumor and shifted B cells to higher expression of CD86 and MHC class II, enhancing the antigen presentation capability and further boosting the antitumor efficacy of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that B cells are associated with ICB- and STING-mediated therapy resistance, and that depleting B-cells or targeting TIM-1 enhances both innate and acquired therapeutic efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have revolutionized B cell malignancy treatment, but subsets of patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) experience primary resistance or relapse after CAR T cell treatment. To uncover tumor microenvironment (TME)-induced resistance mechanisms, we examined patients’ intratumoral immune infiltrates and observed that elevated levels of immunoregulatory macrophages in pre-infusion tumor biopsies are correlated with poor clinical responses. CAR T cell-produced interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) promotes the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS2) in immunoregulatory macrophages, impairing CAR T cell function. Mechanistically, iNOS-expressing macrophages upregulated the p53 pathway, mediating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in CAR T cells, while downregulating the MYC pathway involved in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Furthermore, CAR T cell metabolism is compromised by depletion of glycolytic intermediates and rewiring of the TCA cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of iNOS enhances the CAR T cell treatment efficacy in B cell tumor-bearing mice. Notably, elevated levels of iNOS+CD14+ monocytes were observed in leukaphereses of patients with non-durable response to CAR T cell therapy. These findings suggest that mitigating iNOS in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) by blocking IFN-γ secretion from CAR T cells will improve outcomes for LBCL patients.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 have shown remarkable antitumor efficacy, but can also cause immune-related adverse events, including checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ChILI). This multi-omic study aimed to investigate changes in blood samples from treated cancer patients who developed ChILI. PBMCs were sequenced for by transcriptomic and T cell receptor repertoire (bulk and single-cell immune profiling), and extracellular vesicle (EV) enrichment from plasma was analyzed by mass spectroscopy proteomics. Data were analyzed by comparing the ChILI patient group to the control group who did not develop ChILI and by comparing the onset of ChILI to pre-ICI treatment baseline. We identified significant changes in T cell clonality, gene expression, and proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma in response to liver injury. Onset of ChILI was accompanied by an increase in T cell clonality. Pathway analysis highlighted the involvement of innate and cellular immune responses, mitosis, pyroptosis, and oxidative stress. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that these changes were primarily found in select T cell subtypes (including CD8 + effector memory cells), while CD16 + monocytes exhibited enrichment in metabolic pathways. Proteomic analysis of plasma extracellular vesicles showed enrichment in liver-associated proteins among differentially expressed proteins. Interestingly, an increase in PBMC PD-L1 gene expression and plasma PD-L1 protein was also found to be associated with ChILI onset. These findings provide valuable insights into the immune and molecular mechanisms underlying ChILI as well as potential biomarkers of ChILI. Trial registration number NCT04476563.

        <tr id="Antigen specificity is the central trait distinguishing adaptive from innate immune function. Assembly of antigen-specific T cell and B cell receptors occurs through V(D)J recombination mediated by the Recombinase Activating Gene endonucleases RAG1 and RAG2 (collectively called RAG). In the absence of RAG, mature T and B cells do not develop and thus RAG is critically associated with adaptive immune function. In addition to adaptive T helper 2 (Th2) cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) contribute to type 2 immune responses by producing cytokines like Interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13. Although it has been reported that RAG expression modulates the function of innate natural killer (NK) cells, whether other innate immune cells such as ILC2s are affected by RAG remains unclear. We find that in RAG-deficient mice, ILC2 populations expand and produce increased IL-5 and IL-13 at steady state and contribute to increased inflammation in atopic dermatitis (AD)-like disease. Furthermore, we show that RAG modulates ILC2 function in a cell-intrinsic manner independent of the absence or presence of adaptive T and B lymphocytes. Lastly, employing multiomic single cell analyses of RAG1 lineage-traced cells, we identify key transcriptional and epigenomic ILC2 functional programs that are suppressed by a history of RAG expression. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role for RAG in modulating innate type 2 immunity through suppression of ILC2s.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in immunotherapy, metastatic melanoma remains a considerable therapeutic challenge due to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. Intratumoral type I interferon (IFN-I) has long been associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, several IFN-I subtypes can also paradoxically promote tumor growth in some contexts. We investigated this further by engineering murine B16 melanoma cells to overexpress various IFN-I subtypes, where a spectrum of outcomes was observed. Characterization of these tumors by RNA sequencing revealed a tumor immune phenotype, where potent IFN-I signaling concomitant with diminished type 2 inflammation failed to confer durable tumor control. T cell–mediated rejection of these tumors was restored by introducing interleukin-4 (IL-4) into the tumor microenvironment, either through ectopic expression or in a preclinical adoptive T cell therapy model. Collectively, our findings highlight the IFN-I/IL-4 axis in promoting antitumor immunity, which could be harnessed to target and stratify solid tumors that are nonresponsive to frontline therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via "Trojan horse" leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4⁺T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4⁺cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8+ T cells are pivotal for long-term anti-tumor immunity due to their longevity and rapid response upon encountering tumor cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a member of the Ste20 family of kinases, restricts proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and plays critical roles in T cell priming and activation. However, the impact of HPK1 on CD8+ T cell differentiation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells derived from patients lacking HPK1 exhibit a stronger memory phenotype. HPK1 deletion promotes the formation of precursor and central memory CD8+ T cells, resulting in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity in murine cancer models compared to WT mice. Additionally, HPK1 knockout induces metabolic reprogramming by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration complex activity. Mechanistically, HPK1 deletion downregulates mTOR signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6. Increased mitophagy activity is observed in HPK1-depleted cells, with upregulation of key mitophagy regulators, including Pink1 and Bnip3l, maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our study reveals that HPK1 regulates CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming, guiding cell differentiation and antitumor responses.">

Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo. These findings uncover an unexpected role for CCL2 in inhibiting NK cell responses at the PMN and suggest that targeting EYA3 could be an effective strategy to reactivate antitumor immune responses to inhibit metastasis.">

        <tr id="Background Arginine methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are crucial modulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses, and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages is critical in shaping the TME. Despite ongoing clinical trials of small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 for cancer therapy, their effects on macrophages, a key component of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Methods A pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis was initially conducted to investigate the expression of PRMT5 in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 in mice, as well as the use of a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, was performed to evaluate the impact of PRMT5 on macrophage polarization and tumor progression. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics were employed to explore the mechanistic roles of PRMT5 in regulating lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy was assessed to study its effects on antitumor immunity in vivo. Results The pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the PPARG-macrophage subset, which correlates with poor patient survival. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 reprogrammed macrophages towards an antitumor phenotype, effectively inhibiting tumor progression. Mechanistically, PRMT5 was found to regulate lipid metabolism and drive macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state via the STAT6-PPARγ pathway, fostering an immunosuppressive TME conducive to tumor growth. Notably, Prmt5 deletion induced PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy, demonstrating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Conclusions These findings uncover a crucial role for PRMT5 in macrophage biology and suggest that targeting PRMT5 in myeloid cells offers a promising new approach for cancer immunotherapy. The combination of PRMT5 inhibition with anti-PD-L1 therapy may provide a potent strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a “cold” immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived αvβ3/αvβ5-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Methods Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. Results 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, reflecting the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. Intratumoral administration of 7aaRGD similarly modified the phenotypes of GAMs in human U87-MG gliomas in immunocompromised mice. Exploration of transcriptomic datasets revealed that high expression of integrin receptor coding genes in pre-treatment biopsies was associated with a poorer response to immune check-point blockade in patients with several types of cancers. Conclusions We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.

        <tr id="The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-expressing CD8+ T cells are typically associated with exhaustion in cancer and infections, but their role in autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus nephritis (LN), remains less understood. Understanding the characteristics and functions of PD-1+CD8+ T cells in LN could help identify novel therapeutic strategies. Methods: We analyzed the abundance and phenotypes of PD-1+CD8+ T cells in LN patients and NZB/W F1 mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to delineate subsets and TCR clonal diversity in PD-1+CD8+ T cells in NZB/W F1 mice. The therapeutic efficacy of a PD-L1 Fc fusion protein on kidney pathology and proteinuria in NZB/W F1 mice was evaluated. In addition, the inhibitory mechanism of PD-1 in CD8+ T cells were further explored using RNA-seq, q-PCR, flow cytometry, and Western blot. Results: PD-1+CD8+ T cells were enriched in LN patients and NZB/W F1 mice, exhibiting elevated activation markers and cytotoxic molecules compared to PD-1- cells. scRNA-seq identified seven distinct subsets with diverse effector functions and robust TCR clonal expansion in the kidney of NZB/W F1 mice with severe disease. PD-L1 Fc treatment reduced kidney damage and proteinuria in NZB/W F1 mice, which correlated with decreased frequencies of PD-1+CD8+ and IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, PD-L1 Fc inhibited Stat1 phosphorylation, T-bet expression, and IFN-γ production in CD8+ T cells. Conclusion: These findings show that PD-1+CD8+ T cells in LN are hyperactive, clonally expanded, and contribute to disease progression. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway with PD-L1 Fc effectively reduced kidney pathology in a murine model of LN, underscoring the potential of modulating PD-1 signaling as a treatment strategy for LN.">

        <tr id="The current concept is that the eye is an immune privileged site endowed with innate immune regulatory networks to maintain organ function. We now have evidence that resident T cells occupy intraocular tissues. In immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, tissue resident T cells trigger disease flares in the skin and joints. This suggests resident T cells in the uvea may have similar functions in non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis, a collective term for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the uveal tract causing intraocular inflammation. Here, we demonstrate by spectral cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging that non-inflamed uveal tissue contains multiple T cell subtypes including CD8+ CD103+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. Using single cell RNA & T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile aqueous humour cells from donors with acute, active uveitis, we identify clonally expanded T cells which are enriched for TRM -associated genes. We further show that in donors with active uveitis, CD8+ CD103+ T cells persist within tissue in the uveal tract. Using bulk RNA sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) we show that quiescent iris tissue from donors with a history of uveitis are enriched for genes associated with T cell activation and antigen presentation. Finally, we demonstrate that TRM cells persist in the anterior uvea in mice following resolution of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Our results show that the human eye contains T cells both in health and during active inflammation. Our findings challenge the dogma that the eye is devoid of lymphocytes and supports the concept of resident T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis and as promising targets for therapy.

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction The application of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) reactivates anti-tumour immune responses and prolong postoperative survival. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumour microenvironment, limited patients have achieved pathological regression after treatment. The dual roles of B cells were recently highlighted in ESCC. The study aimed to investigate the role of B cell subclusters and the upstream signalling of B cell differentiation in ESCC resistant to immunotherapy. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed for ESCC specimens with distinct responses to neoadjuvant immunotherapy to map the landscape of intra-tumoural B cells. Results A novel subset of neuropeptide receptor, receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) positive B cells was revealed to accumulate in ESCC that is resistant to neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Stimulated by nociceptor neurons secreting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), RAMP1(+) B cells exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype. The elevated secretion of immune-regulating cytokines by RAMP1(+) B cells blunts the cytotoxicity of Cluster of Differentiation (CD)8(+) T cell and leads to tumour immune evasion. A combination of RAMP1 blocker and anti-Programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 therapies synergistically reinvigorated anti-tumour immunity, reducing tumour progression in vitro. Conclusion The study suggests that RAMP1(+) B cells play a critical role in mediating resistance to neoadjuvant immunotherapy in ESCC. Targeting the CGRP-RAMP axis remodels B cells and enhance the efficacy of current immunotherapies, providing new strategies for overcoming treatment resistance.">

        <tr id="Attempts to activate an anti-tumor immune response in glioblastoma (GBM) have been met with many challenges due to its inherently immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The degree and mechanisms by which molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this state are poorly defined. In this study, our multifaceted approach combining bioinformatics analyses of clinical and experimental datasets, single-cell sequencing, and the molecular and pharmacologic manipulation of patient-derived cells identified GSCs expressing immunosuppressive effectors mimicking regulatory T cells (Tregs). We showed that this immunosuppressive Treg-like (ITL) GSC state is specific to the mesenchymal GSC subset and is associated with and driven specifically by TGFβ type II receptor (TGFBR2) in contrast to TGFBR1. Transgenic TGFBR2 expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres promoted a mesenchymal transition and induced a six-gene ITL signature consisting of CD274 (PD-L1), NT5E (CD73), ENTPD1 (CD39), LGALS1 (galectin-1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), and TGFB1. This TGFBR2-driven ITL signature was identified in clinical GBM specimens, patient-derived GSCs, and systemic mesenchymal malignancies. TGFBR2high GSCs inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T cell viability and their capacity to kill GBM cells, effects reversed by pharmacologic and shRNA-based TGFBR2 inhibition. Collectively, our data identify an immunosuppressive GSC state that is TGFBR2-dependent and susceptible to TGFBR2-targeted therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Various inhibitors targeting T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing molecule 3 (TIM3) aimed at reversing T-cell exhaustion for better immunotherapy outcomes have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy as monotherapy, with the underlying mechanisms remaining ambiguous. TIM3 is markedly expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), and the inconsistent research findings on its role in myeloid cells underscore its vital function within DCs. Through the establishment of an in vitro differentiation model generating mature dendritic cells (mDCs) under TIM3-targeted interventions, combined with an RNA sequencing analysis, this investigation systematically examined TIM3-mediated regulation and ligand interactions in human primary DCs. The findings indicate that TIM3 inhibition hinders DC maturation, which subsequently diminishes the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, ultimately leading to immune suppression in T cells. These findings collectively establish TIM3 as a regulator of DC differentiation that promotes DC maturation while optimizing the antigen-processing and presentation capacity. This study elucidates the rationale behind the suboptimal efficacy of TIM3 inhibitors and advocates for retaining TIM3 signaling pathways in DCs.">

        <tr id="Background T cells play a central role in host protection against respiratory pathogens, but a maladaptive T cell response can lead to pulmonary diseases. Defining the biology of protective versus pathogenic T cell responses in the lungs of humans will be critical to nominate novel approaches to improve respiratory health. Previous studies have examined T cells from the lungs captured via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial brushings, or biopsies. However, whether these different approaches are capturing distinct T cell phenotypes and/or clonotypes remains unclear. Objective To evaluate and compare the transcriptional signatures of T cells isolated via BAL versus endobronchial brushings in healthy controls (HCs) and allergic asthmatics (AAs). Methods Flexible bronchoscopy was performed to obtain BAL and endobronchial brushings from 3 HC and 3 AA subjects. CD3+ T cells were sorted and single cell RNA- and T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing was performed using the 10X Chromium platform. Unbiased clustering, differential gene expression analysis and TCR repertoire analysis was performed. Results Unbiased clustering analysis allowed us to define 7 CD8 and 6 CD4 T cell subsets. The most significant difference in T cell subsets abundance between AAs and HCs was the enrichment of CD4 T helper type 2 (Th2) cells when comparing endobronchial brush samples (OR=26.2, P=0.002), but not when examining BAL (OR=1.7, P=0.46), indicating differences in the T cell subsets captured from the BAL versus airway mucosa specimen processing. In further support of this observation, comparing the BAL and brush T cells across all subjects revealed an up-regulation of resident-memory T cell markers (i.e. ITGAE, CD69) in brush T cells versus BAL T cells in both CD4 and CD8 lineages. In contrast, BAL CD8 and CD4 T cells exhibited an enriched type I and II interferon signatures compared to brush T cells. Lastly, TCR repertoire analysis revealed that brush T cells contained dramatically expanded TCR clones. Expanded T cell clones from the brush expressed high levels of resident-memory markers, suggesting the airway mucosa is enriched for TRM cells with unique TCR specificity. Conclusions Sampling T cells via BAL versus airway brushings yielded distinct T cell phenotypes and clonotypes with important implications for future research in lung immunology.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, systemic Treg depletion is not favored due to the crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a key chemokine receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating Tregs and targeted blockade of CCR8 exerts anticancer effect in several cancer types, but whether this pathway is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods We determined the involvement of CCR8+ Tregs in HCC using human HCC tissues and TCGA database, and examined the anticancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CCR8 antagonist, IPG0521m, which was developed in house, in murine liver cancer model with flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and Real-Time PCR. Results Remarkable increase in CCR8+ Tregs was observed in human HCC tissues. Treatment of syngeneic liver cancer model with IPG0521m resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, associated with increased CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis indicated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in remarkable increase in antitumor immunity. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in a switch of Tregs from high immunosuppression to low immunosuppression phenotype, associated with elevated CD8+ T and NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor tissues. Conclusions IPG0521m inhibited liver cancer growth via reducing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs, thereby boosting anti-cancer immunity. Our study paves the way for the clinical study of CCR8 antagonist in HCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="Introduction Porcine Circovirus (PCV2) infection is prevalent in pig farming and causes significant economic losses. In recent years, the PCV2d subtype has become the most prevalent genotype worldwide, exhibiting higher virulence, leading to more severe viremia and organ damage. Therefore, studying the biological characteristics of the PCV2d subtype is of great significance. Methods We established a PCV2d infection model using BALB/c mice and employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically analyze the transcriptome of 10 cell types in the lung tissues of infected mice. We developed a comprehensive marker gene catalog for these cell types. Results Compared to uninfected mice, PCV2d infection induced extensive viral replication and immunosuppressive responses in most cell types. Monocyte macrophages with high levels of viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various cell population interactions occurring through CD40-CD40L and CXCL14-CXCR4 were identified. These cells predominantly mediate antigen presentation and processing pathways in vivo, contributing to PCV2d-driven inflammatory lung injury. Discussion Our data uncovered a complex unique immune response scenario in the lung tissue of mice after PCV2d infection, deciphering the potential mechanisms underlying PCV2d-driven inflammatory responses in mice. Furthermore, this study provides a rich database for the molecular basis of different cell types' responses to PCV2d infection.">

        <tr id="Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have substantially improved the lives of people with HIV (PWH) and reduced HIV acquisition through pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, the long-term effect of ART on the physiological state of cells remains poorly understood. Despite the success of ART in preventing the progression of HIV infection to AIDS, PWH are suffering from a disproportional burden of non-AIDS comorbidities, including lung diseases. Given the central function of alveolar macrophages (AM) in pulmonary immunity, we evaluated the impact of time on ART on AM of PWH and people on PrEP. Employing a retrospective cross-sectional design, we showed that ART imprinted a pro-inflammatory and senescence-like epigenetic and transcriptomic state on AM. This effect of ART was detected irrespective of HIV infection. Increased epigenetic priming and gene expression of cell cycle arrest markers such as CDKN1A (p21), senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes, e.g. IL6R and CXCL8, and transcription factors subunits of the AP-1 family were a hallmark of ART exposure. The ART-linked epigenetic and transcriptomic changes were strongly dependent on the duration of ART for both the PWH and PrEP groups and consistent with dysregulated AM function. SASP contributes to the pathophysiology of multiple lung diseases such as COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma. Combined, our data suggested that long-term ART contributes to age-related pulmonary comorbidities in PWH. Given the strong correlation with time on ART and adverse effects in PWH, it is possible that long-term PrEP may result in similar clinical outcomes. While PrEP is critically important for preventing HIV acquisition in the most vulnerable populations, our study advocates for adjuvant therapies and improved drug design to prevent or mitigate potential long-term adverse effects of PrEP.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and, despite treatment advances, immune suppression remains an obstacle to effective therapy. Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.">

        <tr id="Background CXCR1/2 inhibitors are being implemented with immunotherapies in PDAC clinical trials. CXC-ligands are a family of cytokines responsible for stimulating these receptors; while typically secreted by activated immune cells, fibroblasts, and even adipocytes, they are also secreted by immune-evasive cancer cells. CXC-ligand release is known to occur in response to inflammatory stimuli. Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ and a source of inflammatory signaling peptides. Importantly, adipose-derived cytokines and chemokines are implicated as potential drivers of tumor cell immune evasion; cumulatively, these findings suggest that targeting CXC-ligands may be beneficial in the context of obesity. Methods RNA-sequencing of human PDAC cell lines was used to assess influences of adipose conditioned media on the cancer cell transcriptome. The adipose-induced secretome of PDAC cells was validated with ELISA for induction of CXCL5 secretion. Human tissue data from CPTAC was used to correlate IL-1β and TNF expression with both CXCL5 mRNA and protein levels. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout CXCL5 from a murine PDAC KPC cell line to assess orthotopic tumor studies in syngeneic, diet-induced obese mice. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the immune profiles between tumors with or without CXCL5. Mice-bearing CXCL5 competent or deficient tumors were monitored for differential tumor size in response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Results Human adipose tissue conditioned media stimulates CXCL5 secretion from PDAC cells via either IL-1β or TNF; neutralization of both is required to significantly block the release of CXCL5 from tumor cells. Ablation of CXCL5 from tumors promoted an enriched immune phenotype with an unanticipatedly increased number of exhausted CD8 T cells. Application of anti-PD-1 treatment to control tumors failed to alter tumor growth, yet treatment of CXCL5-deficient tumors showed response by significantly diminished tumor mass. Conclusions In summary, our findings show that both TNF and IL-1β can stimulate CXCL5 release from PDAC cells in vitro, which correlates with expression in patient data. CXCL5 depletion in vivo alone is sufficient to promote T cell infiltration into tumors, increasing efficacy and requiring checkpoint blockade inhibition to alleviate tumor burden.">

        <tr id="Transplant recipients require lifelong, multimodal immunosuppression to prevent rejection by reducing alloreactive immunity. Rapamycin, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is known to modulate adaptive and innate immunity, while the full spectrum of its immunosuppressive mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Given the broad expression of mTOR, we investigated the understudied effects of rapamycin on lymph node (LN) architecture, leukocyte trafficking, and the gut microbiome and metabolism after 3, 7, and 30 days of rapamycin treatment, to characterize the early, intermediate, and late changes. Rapamycin significantly reduced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral LNs, mesenteric LNs, and the spleen over time. Rapamycin induced early pro-inflammation transition to pro-tolerogenic status, by modulating the LN laminin α4:α5 expression ratios through LN stromal cells laminin α5 expression and by adjusting Treg numbers and distribution. Additionally, rapamycin significantly altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic functions, shifting the Bacteroides to Firmicutes ratio and increasing amino acid bioavailability in the gut lumen. These effects were evident by 7 days and became most pronounced by 30 days in naïve mice, with notable changes as early as 3 days in allogeneic splenocyte-stimulated mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapamycin’s action through time-dependent modulation of LN architecture and gut microbiome, which orchestrates changes in immune cell trafficking, providing a new framework for understanding and optimizing immunosuppressive therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective: Chronic HBV infection disproportionately affects people living with HIV, who are often excluded from functional cure studies. This study investigates CD8+ T cell profiles in HBV mono-infection versus HBV/HIV co-infection, examining the impact of long-term therapy on virus-specific responses with the goal of informing therapeutic strategies for immune restoration. Design: We analysed CD8+ T cell responses in 61 participants (HBV n=20, HBV/HIV n=20, HIV n=21), on suppressive antiviral therapy. We assessed transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, focusing on exhaustion markers alongside virus-specific functional capabilities. Results: Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct signature in co-infection, with upregulation of genes associated with TCR signaling, inhibitory pathways and progenitor-exhausted markers (XCL2, TCF7, PDCD1, IL7R). This gene profile scored highly for a precursor exhausted (Tpex) CD8+ T cell signature, reflecting a "stemness" programme that maintains plasticity despite chronic antigen exposure. Proteomic analysis confirmed higher frequencies of precursor exhausted TCF-1+CD127+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in co-infection, while HBV mono-infection showed predominance of terminally exhausted ToxhighTCF-1-CD127- cells. These differences correlated with more robust, polyfunctional HBV-specific responses in co-infection against surface and core antigens. Lower HBsAg levels and longer treatment duration in co-infection associated positively with Tpex populations and functional responses and inversely with terminal exhaustion. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that individuals with well-controlled HBV/HIV co-infection maintain more robust CD8+ T cell responses with preserved stem-like properties supporting ongoing antiviral function. These results underscore the benefits of early antiretroviral intervention and the need for tailored immune-modulatory therapies to restore antiviral functionality in these diverse patient populations.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality but heterogeneity in patient responsiveness remains. Thus, greater understanding of the immunologic factors that dictate response to immunotherapy is critical to improve patient outcomes. Here, we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is elevated in the setting of melanoma in humans and mice and plays a functional role in inhibiting the CD8+ T cell response. Surprisingly, the tumor itself is not the major cellular source of Fgl2. Instead, we found that macrophage-secreted Fgl2 dampens the CD8+ T cell response through binding and apoptosis of FcγRIIB+CD8+ T cells. This regulation was CD8+ T cell autonomous and not via an antigen-presenting cell intermediary, as absence of Fcgr2b from the CD8+ T cells rendered T cells insensitive to Fgl2 regulation.

        <tr id="Background: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and holds great potential for them, including metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, immune resistance remains a major obstacle, limiting its efficacy and durability. Understanding the mechanisms of immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is pivotal for overcoming these challenges and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Methods: Over 2000 samples, including a real-world cohort of 230 advanced ccRCC patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) were analyzed. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from 13 tumor regions were categorized into ICB-exposed, ICB-resistant, and ICB-responsive groups. Multiple robust algorithms and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to explore TME composition and macrophage heterogeneity. Spatial communication dynamics were further investigated. In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of SPP1 on 786-O and 769-P cells. Co-culture experiments with THP-1-derived macrophages, followed by Western blot, flow cytometry, and functional assays, were performed to investigate SPP1-mediated macrophage polarization and its impact on tumor progression. Results: The results revealed an elevated presence of Apolipoprotein E (APOE)+ macrophages in ICB-resistant ccRCC. Notably, higher APOE+ macrophage proportion indicated shorter prognosis and worse response to ICB (P < 0.001). Elevated expression of CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Delta (CEBPD) was markedly linked to several immunosuppressive pathways, hindering T cell recruitment, promoting exhaustion, ultimately diminishing poorer prognosis and worse ICB efficacy. Meanwhile, upregulated Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) significantly enhances the proliferation, clonal formation, and migration of ccRCC cells. Tumor-derived SPP1. Additionally, SPP1 signaling from malignant cells appeared to recruit APOE+ macrophages to tumor margins, and promotes macrophage polarization into APOE+ M2-like macrophages. In the vicinity of the tumor, these APOE+ macrophages shape immunosuppressive TME by releasing abundant TGF-β signals, limiting anti-tumor effector T cells activity in ICB-resistant tumors, and contributing to tumor progression. Conclusion: This study reveals the critical role of APOE+ macrophages in promoting immune suppression and resistance to ICB therapy in ccRCC. By promoting T cell exhaustion and immunosuppressive signaling, particularly via localized TGF-β, these spatially segregated macrophages undermine treatment efficacy. Targeting APOE+ macrophages, especially in conjunction with ICB, presents a promising strategy to overcome immune resistance and enhance outcomes for ccRCC patients.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. The pathomechanism of RA depends on both B and T cells. Regulatory B cells (Breg) have been shown to suppress T-cell immune responses and play a key role in modulating autoimmune processes. We aimed to investigate the possibility of utilizing PD-L1+ Breg cells in downregulating the Th cells’ immune response in healthy individuals and RA patients. We hypothesized that the PD-1/PD-1L interaction plays a key role in this process, which may be defective in autoimmune diseases. We separated T and B cells from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and RA patients by magnetic cell sorting, and Th cells and Treg cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The cytokine production by CD4+ Th cells was detected by intracellular flow cytometry. CpG and CD40L stimulations were applied to induce PD-L1hi expressing Breg cells. We found that the frequency of PD-L1hi cells is significantly lower in all B-cell subsets in RA compared to healthy controls. Functional analysis of induced PD-L1+ Breg cells in coculture with activated autologous Th cells has shown that healthy control samples containing higher levels of PD-L1hi Breg cells significantly inhibit IFN-ү and IL-21 production by Th cells. In contrast, RA patients’ samples with lower levels of PD-L1hi Breg cells failed to do so. Since the expression of PD-L1 on B cells can be modulated in vitro to induce Breg cell suppressive capacity, these data may provide new perspectives for future therapy for RA.">

        <tr id="Background Adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is now a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for melanoma. While this is a major milestone, there is room for improvement to increase clinical response rates and to further optimize the manufacturing of TIL products. In this study, we characterized the association of tumor-infiltrating B-cells (TIL-B) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) with clinical response to TIL therapy and tested whether the presence of B-cells in the tumor can be leveraged to optimize TIL manufacture. Methods Tumor sections from TIL responders (R, n=9) and non-responders (NR, n=11) were analyzed by RNA sequencing, and immune cell content was estimated in silico. To study the association between B-cells and TIL expansion, we quantified B-cell subsets and TIL phenotype by flow cytometry. CD40L-induced effects on melanoma-infiltrating B-cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and scRNA-sequencing. Results Tumors from TIL clinical responders had greater abundance of class-switched B-cells (p=0.007) and a greater TLS score (p=0.03) than those of NRs. In addition, greater abundance of B-cells (p≤0.05) and switched memory B-cells (CD27+ IgD−, p≤0.05) in the tumors were associated with greater TIL expansion. Stimulation of TIL-B through addition of CD40L during TIL ex vivo culture improved their expansion success rate from 33% to 67% (p=0.03). Similarly, the addition of CD40L to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) TIL cultures shortened the manufacturing period by 1 week. Moreover, CD40L-enhanced TIL showed more stem-like T-cells (CD39− CD69−, p≤0.05) and an enrichment of neoantigen-reactive T-cell clones in NSCLC TIL. Gene expression analysis showed that CD40L induced gene expression changes in TIL-B after 48 hours in culture (126 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)), with minimal to no changes observed in other immune cell types (including 12 DEG in macrophages, 10 DEG in dendritic cells, and none in monocytes). B-cell DEGs included upregulated co-stimulatory ligands (CD83, CD58), chemokines (CCL22, CCL17), among others. CD40L-induced upregulation of CD58 by melanoma infiltrating B-cells was associated with successful TIL expansion. Conclusions Our results show that CD40L-stimulated B-cells can be leveraged to enhance the quality and quantity of TIL. Clinical trial NCT05681780 is currently testing this concept applied to NSCLC TIL.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition characterized by recurrent immune dysregulation. Materials & Methods This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of immune cell subsets, metabolic markers, and their interplay in BD patients. Using multiparametric flow cytometry, we identified elevated Th1 cells, senescent CD8+ T cells, and abnormal B cell activation as hallmarks of the chronic inflammatory state in BD. Results Despite immunotherapy, innate immune activation persisted, with increased mature NK cells, γδT1 cells, and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), alongside reduced plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Elevated glucose (GLU) and triacylglycerol (TAG) levels in BD patients correlated with increased Th1 cells, functional CD8+ T cells, and B cell activation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that GLU and TAG promote Th1 differentiation, CD8+ T cell activation, and B cell antibody production, revealing their role as drivers of immune dysregulation. Conclusion These findings underscore the intricate relationship between metabolic dysregulation and immune dysfunction in BD, highlighting potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Our study provides critical insights into BD pathogenesis, offering a foundation for optimizing disease management and monitoring immune and metabolic markers for improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Introduction MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) is a key adaptor protein mediate immune responses, primarily through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling. The TLR/MYD88 pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cells (DC) maturation and function, contributing to the body’s innate immunity. Recent studies have further highlighted MYD88’s pivotal role in intrinsic immunity and its regulatory influence on the tumor microenvironment (TME) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of MYD88 in DCs and its regulatory role in the TME have gained increasing attention. Methods RNA-sequencing data retrieved from the TCGA and GEO databases were utilized for both the training and validation of our signature. Single-cell RNA transcriptome data from GEO were analyzed to investigate the correlation among subclusters of T cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) within the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME). A combination of bioinformatics and machine learning approaches was employed to perform statistical analyses.Additionally, flow cytometry was conducted to quantify T cell subtypes and assess biomarker expression in DCs. A BALB/c-derived xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the functional role of MyD88 in tumor progression and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to reassess the biological effects of MyD88 in HCC patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Results Our pan-cancer data analysis further highlights the significant impact of MYD88 on clinical outcomes in HCC. Analysis of TCGA and GEO databases confirms that MYD88 serves as a key signaling molecule in DCs, reinforcing its critical role in immune regulation. Our in vitro experiments demonstrates that MyD88 modulates T cell function through DCs. In vivo, H22 tumor cells exhibited accelerated growth in MyD88 knockout mice and a reduced response to anti-PD-1 treatment, whereas wild-type mice showed the opposite trend. Discussion These findings underscore the critical role of MYD88 in DC function, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunoregulation in HCC. By shaping the TME, MYD88 not only regulates the immune response in HCC but also influences patient clinical outcomes. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments further validate that MYD88 impacts DC functionality, contributing to variations in HCC progression">

        <tr id="Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="In solid tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex mix of tumor, immune, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a fraction of immune cells that may infiltrate into the TME. The primary function of these T-cells is to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME primarily mediated by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as the tumor cells themselves, T-cells fail to differentiate into effector cells or become dysfunctional and are unable to eliminate the tumor. In addition, chronic antigen stimulation within the TME also leads to a phenomenon, first identified in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, where the T-cells become exhausted and lose their effector functions. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) are characterized by the presence of remarkably conserved inhibitory receptors, transcription and signaling factors and the downregulation of key effector molecules. Tex cells have been identified in various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. Recent studies have indicated novel strategies to reverse T-cell exhaustion. These include checkpoint inhibitor blockade targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), or combinations of different immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) or combination of ICTs with cytokine co-stimulation. In this review, we discuss aspects of T-cell dysfunction within the TME with a focus on T-cell exhaustion. We believe that gaining insight into the mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion within the TME of human solid tumors will pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to target and potentially re-invigorate exhausted T-cells in cancer.">

This study investigates the role of NK cells in modulating DC signaling pathways and the recruitment of DCs during Chlamydia muridarum infection. Transcriptomic analyses revealed significant downregulation of key genes in DCs from NK-depleted mice involved in type I immunity, including IL12rb2, IL-18rap, and chemokine signaling components such as Ccl3, Ccl5, and Ccr5. Gene ontology (GO) analyses confirmed impaired chemokine–chemokine receptor interactions in DCs from NK-depleted mice. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis showed that NK-cell depletion reduced CCR5 expression on splenic and pulmonary DCs, impairing their migration toward CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, IFN-γ enhanced CCR5 expression on the surface of DCs, consequently promoting their migration, which was blocked by anti-IFN-γ antibodies. In vitro migration assays showed that treatment of DCs with IFN-γ increased their responsiveness to CCL3 and CCL5, the ligands of CCR5. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the indispensable role of NK cells in orchestrating DC signaling and the recruitment of DCs during chlamydial infection.">

        <tr id="Tumor dissemination is a key event in tumor progression. During this event, a main role is played by circulating tumor cells (CTCs), immune cells, and their interaction. How the immune system supports the survival and proliferation of CTCs is not fully elucidated. In this study we established an in-vitro co-culture system consisting of immune cells and CTCs from the same patient, which increased the success rate in the establishment of CTC-derived long-term cell cultures. In this system, we characterized the immune cells of successful co-cultures and the signals they exchange with cancer cells, including cytokines and extracellular vesicle (EV) content. Using this protocol, we stabilized four CTC-derived cell lines from patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer, which were cultured for over a year and characterized from a genetic and molecular point of view. The four cell lines harbor shared chromosomal aberrations including the amplification at 8q24.21 containing MYC and deletion 9p21.3 containing CDKN2A/B and the IFN type I cluster. The transcriptomic profile of CTC cell lines is distinct from primary tumors, and we detected the activation of E2F, G2M and MYC pathways and the downregulation of interferon response pathway. Each cell line shows a degree of invasiveness in zebrafish in-vivo, and the most invasive ones share the same mutation in RAB14 gene. In addition, the four cell lines secrete cell-line specific EVs containing microRNAs that target YAP, BRG1-AKT1, TCF8-HDAC pathways. Overall, we highlight how the immune system plays a key role in the proliferation of CTCs through EV signaling, and how CTC cell line genomic and transcriptomic alterations make these cells less visible from the immune system and likely responsible for the survival advantage in sites distant from the microenvironment of origin.">

        <tr id="Exploiting the immune system to eradicate cancer cells is an area of intense clinical study. However, the mechanisms that shape the tumor-immune microenvironment are incompletely understood. Here, we identify Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins as novel modulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment across diverse cancers. We demonstrate that loss of tumor MBNL expression results in an attenuated response to interferon gamma and reduced tumor antigen presentation in melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer cells. Parallel experiments in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model revealed that MBNL loss reduces tumor cell killing by CD8 + T cells in vitro and facilitates tumor escape from cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration in vivo. Finally, we extended these studies to 29 human cancer types to find that MBNL expression levels are strongly associated with gene expression signatures of T cell tumor infiltration. These insights suggest that MBNL proteins play important roles in shaping the immune landscape across diverse malignancies.">

        <tr id="In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (Tregs) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes Tregs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD+ with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing Tregs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral Tregs, sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD+ axis disrupts Tregs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have shown that the antitumor immunity of adaptive immune cells is regulated by Vitamin A (retinoic acid, RA). However, it remains unclear whether RA and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling can modulate antitumor immunity by reversing immune exhaustion of innate-like γδ T cells in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Periphery blood samples from patients with NPC were prospectively collected, and phenotypic and functional analyses of γδ T cells were performed using flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing models and RAR inhibitor approaches were utilized to investigate RA/RAR-mediated regulation of T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) and the antitumor activity of γδ T cells. Here, our findings indicate that immune exhaustion markers are highly expressed on peripheral αβ and γδ T cells in NPC patients. Serum RA levels are negatively correlated with the abundance of Tim-3 on circulating Vδ2 T cells. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RA/RAR signaling directly targets Vδ2 T cells, repressing Tim-3 expression, promoting NF-κB activation, and enhancing the production of antitumor-related cytokines. Notably, RA supplementation improved the efficacy of Vδ2 T cell-mediated immunotherapy in human NPC by suppressing Tim-3 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that RA/RAR signaling plays a crucial role in reversing immune exhaustion and represents a promising target for γδ T cell antitumor immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Objective Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating anti-tumor immune responses. However, various factors can suppress DCs function and compromise anti-tumor immunity. Itaconate, a metabolite activated during inflammation and infection, has been identified to possess immunomodulatory properties, but its role on DCs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of itaconate in regulating the maturation and function of DCs and its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were treated with 4-octyl itaconate (4OI). The expression levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II on BMDCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of cytokines was assessed using RT-qPCR. BMDCs with different treatment were adoptively transferred to B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice. The production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein level of NRF2 in BMDCs was analyzed by Western blot. Results Treatment with 4OI represses DC maturation and function. Specifically, 4OI-treated DCs exhibited impaired phenotypic and functional maturation, characterized by decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86, as well as lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, these DCs demonstrated a diminished capacity to stimulate T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 4OI inhibits DCs maturation and function through enhancing and activating KEAP1/NRF2 pathway. Conclusion This study reveals that 4OI inhibits DC function through NRF2 activation, elucidating the immunomodulatory mechanisms of itaconate and emphasizing its pivotal role in developing targeted DC-based tumor immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells play critical roles in the positive and negative regulation of cellular immunity through the many functional subsets they comprise. The progressive growth of immunogenic tumors which nonetheless generate mutation-specific T cells suggests that effective immune control may be avoided or suppressed at the level of the neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cell response. We used a tetramer specific for a validated neoantigen, CTLCH129>Q/I-Ek, to characterize the ontogeny of natural CD4+ T cell responses to an aggressive and poorly immunogenic Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHCII)-deficient tumor, SCC VII, during progressive growth or following therapeutic peptide vaccination. We find that the natural CD4+ T cell response to a growing tumor is phenotypically and functionally diverse, with distinct subsets including type 1 helper (Th1), T follicular helper (Tfh)-like, and regulatory T cell (Treg) lineages appearing as early as 9 days after tumor implantation. Therapeutic vaccination using the CLTCH129>Q peptide in adjuvant plus α-PD-1 sharply reduces the frequency of CLTCH129>Q-specific Treg frequency in both tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (tdLN). Single cell transcriptomic analysis of CLTC-specific CD4+ T cells recapitulated and extended the diversity of the response, with TCRs of varying affinity found within each functional subset. The TCR affinity differences did not strictly correlate with function, however, as even the lowest affinity TCRs isolated from Treg can mediate therapeutic efficacy against established tumors in the setting of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT). These findings offer unprecedented insight into the functional diversity of a natural neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cell response and show how immunotherapeutic intervention influences the phenotype, magnitude, and efficacy of the anti-tumor immune response. What is already known on this topic Little is known about the ontogeny, architecture, development of the CD4+ NeoAg-specific repertoire induced by progressively-growing tumor. This study was performed to address this topic and contribute new information to aid in its understanding What this study adds This study reveals that the NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cell response to a growing tumor is phenotypically and functionally diverse, featuring a range of functional T cells subsets including TH1, TFH, and Treg expressing a range of functional TCR avidities, and demonstrates how an immunotherapeutic NeoAg vaccine can alter their relative composition within the tumor and tumor-draining lymph node. How this study might affect research, practice or policy This study offers new insights into the diversity of NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells and their response to a tumor in the presence or absence of immunotherapeutic intervention. This information could lead to new approaches to immune monitoring in the clinical setting of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and cancer vaccines. Furthermore, we show that Treg can be a potent source of TCRs that can mediate therapeutic benefit in the setting of adoptive cell therapy (ACT).">

        <tr id="In the tumor host, neutrophils may exhibit protumor or antitumor activity. It is hypothesized that in response to host-derived or therapy-induced factors, neutrophils adopt diverse functional states to ultimately execute these differential functions. Here, we provide an alternative scenario in which the response of an individual tumor cell population determines the overall protumor versus antitumor outcome of neutrophil‒tumor interactions. Experimentally, we show that human neutrophils, which are sequentially stimulated with bacteria and secreted factors from tumor cells, kill a certain proportion of tumor target cells. However, the majority of the tumor cells remained resistant to this neutrophil-mediated killing and underwent a functional, phenotypic and transcriptomic switch that was reminiscent of partial epithelial‒to-mesenchymal transition. This cell biological switch was associated with physical escape from NK-mediated killing and resulted in enhanced metastasis to the lymph nodes in a preclinical orthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, we identified the antimicrobial neutrophil granule proteins neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) as the molecular mediators of this functional switch. We validated these data in patients with head and neck cancer and identified bacterially colonized intratumoral niches that were enriched for mesenchymal tumor cells and neutrophils expressing NE and MMP-9. Our data reveal the parallel execution of tumor cytotoxic and prometastatic activity by activated neutrophils and identify NE and MMP-9 as mediators of lymph node metastasis. The identified mechanism explains the functional dichotomy of tumor-associated neutrophils at the level of the tumor target cell response and has implications for superinfected cancers and the dysbiotic tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Recombinant interferon alpha (IFNα) has been used to treat cancer patients for over 30 years; however, its clinical utility has been limited by a narrow therapeutic index. Given the recognized anti-tumor and immunomodulatory impacts of IFNα, the development of novel strategies to harness these attributes while minimizing associated toxicity could provide significant benefit for patients. The concept of attenuating IFNα binding affinity for its receptor was conceived to address this challenge and led to the development of CD38-targeted Attenukine™, a CD38-targeted antibody attenuated IFNα immunocytokine. In this study, we sought to delineate the effects of targeting AttenukineTM specifically to tumor cells and/or immune cells using an antibody to CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on certain tumor and immune cells, using different mouse models and anti-human or anti-mouse CD38-targeted Attenukine™. Our results demonstrate that an anti-human CD38 AttenukineTM inhibits tumor growth through direct anti-proliferative effects of IFNα on CD38 + tumor cells as well as by indirectly modulating the anti-tumor immune response. In various in vivo models leveraging syngeneic mice bearing tumors with or without CD38 expression, administration of CD38-murine AttenukineTM mediated anti-tumor efficacy with increased immune activation and intra-tumoral infiltration. These data point to a potential dual mechanism of action for CD38-targeted Attenukine™, involving both tumor- and immune-directed effects, and highlight the potential benefit of a CD38-targeted attenuated IFNα therapy to deliver the known effects of IFNαtreatment to a broad spectrum of patients, while limiting the toxicity typically associated with recombinant IFNα.">

        <tr id="Background Selective and potent Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are currently under evaluation in preclinical models and clinical studies to understand how the innate immune system can be harnessed for therapeutic potential. These molecules are designed to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, making them promising therapeutic candidates for treating diseases such as cancer or chronic viral infections. Much is known about the expression and signaling of TLRs which varies based on cell type, cellular localization, and tissue distribution. However, the downstream effects of different TLR agonists on cellular populations and phenotypes are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of TLR pathway stimulation on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from people living with HIV (PLWH) and healthy donors. Methods The effects of TLR4, TLR7, TLR7/8, TLR8 and TLR9 agonists were evaluated on cytokine production, cell population frequencies, and morphological characteristics of PBMC cultures over time. Changes in the proportions of different cell populations in blood and morphological features were assessed using high-content imaging and analyzed using an AI-driven approach. Results TLR4 and TLR8 agonists promoted a compositional shift and accumulation of small round (lymphocyte-like) PBMCs, whereas TLR9 agonists led to an accumulation of large round (myeloid-like) PBMCs. A related increase was observed in markers of cell death, most prominently with TLR4 and TLR8 agonists. All TLR agonists were shown to promote some features associated with cellular migration. Furthermore, a comparison of TLR agonist responses in healthy and HIV-positive PBMCs revealed pronounced differences in cytokine/chemokine responses and morphological cellular features. Most notably, higher actin contraction and nuclear fragmentation was observed in response to TLR4, TLR7, TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists for antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed PLWH versus healthy PBMCs. Conclusions These data suggest that machine learning, combined with cell imaging and cytokine quantification, can be used to better understand the cytological and soluble immune responses following treatments with immunomodulatory agents in vitro. In addition, comparisons of these responses between disease states are possible with the appropriate patient samples.">

Immunosuppressive cells in the bone marrow environment inhibit endogenous T-lymphocytes activity and reduce the efficacy immunotherapies. Abnormal bone marrow monocytes in MM have been associated with inferior outcomes. This study explored the mechanism of T-lymphocytes suppression by bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in MM. Methods Single-cell RNA sequence data (GSE124310) derived from MM samples were analyzed. CD14+ monocytes from the bone marrow of patients with newly-diagnosed MM were detected, and RNA sequencing was performed. Interactions between CD14+ monocytes and T-lymphocytes, as along with the corresponding downstream signaling mechanism, were assessed through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The alterations in MHC II signaling related to outgoing interaction were decreased in CD14 + monocytes from patients with MM. Abnormal numbers, defective antigen presentation, and downregulated surface co-stimulatory molecules in bone marrow CD14+ monocytes were also observed. RNA sequencing identified upregulated expression of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2 (ULK2) in these monocytes, a protein involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathway. CD14+ monocytes from patients with NDMM suppressed T-lymphocyte activity, and treatment of CD14+ monocytes with a ULK1/ULK2 inhibitor alleviated this suppression. MM xenograft model showed that CD14+ monocytes high-expressing ULK2 suppressed T-lymphocytes and promoted tumor growth. Conclusion We demonstrated that CD14+ monocytes from MM can disrupt the delivery of antigenic peptides through the antigen processing and presentation pathway. This disruption affects T-lymphocytes activity and attenuates their ability to kill malignant cells and secrete cytokines. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the immuno-suppressive environment in MM, improving the efficacy of immunotherapy based on T-lymphocytes, and developing new therapeutic targets.

Although CD4 T-cells are key immune effectors to control TB, early after infection, the innate immune response must play a role in tackling the disease. Here, we performed in-depth analyses of the acute immune response to MTBVAC, a candidate vaccine engineered from Mtb with the aim of protecting adults from pulmonary TB disease, still a major global challenge. scRNA-seq shows expansion of CD4+ and cytotoxic γδ T-cells, data confirmed by flow cytometry. CD4 T-cells exhibited lower HLA-DR and higher L-selectin expression, compared to BCG-stimulation, indicating differential activation or dynamics. Importantly, MTBVAC-activated γδ T-cells had a unique cytotoxic CD16+GZMB+ phenotype, reminiscent of effector cells found in Mtb positive individuals controlling infection. IFN-γ and TNF-α were released in cultures, while IL-17A/F were almost undetectable.">

        <tr id="Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of T cell maturation and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell function in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, which counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses. Methods Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and subjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune cell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell exhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell differentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were investigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived tumor organoids. Results MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively associated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It correlates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of immune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting their 3’ untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell promotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T cells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression and suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing ectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in mice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced with miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from the same patients. Conclusions MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ T cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could represent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering promising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells can recognize and kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected cells in vitro, however their role after natural human exposure has not been well-studied. To identify Mtb-responsive NK cell populations, we analyzed the peripheral blood of healthy household contacts of active Tuberculosis (TB) cases and source community donors in an endemic region of Port-au-Prince, Haiti by flow cytometry. We observed higher CD8α expression on NK cells in putative resistors (Interferon γ release assay negative; IGRA− contacts) with a loss of CD8α surface expression during household-associated exposure and active TB disease. In vitro assays and CITE-seq analysis of CD8α+ NK cells demonstrated enhanced maturity, cytotoxic gene expression, and response to cytokine stimulation relative to CD8α− NK cells. CD8α+ NK cells also displayed dynamic surface expression dependent on MHC class I in contrast to conventional CD8+ T cells. Together, these results support a specialized role for CD8α+ NK cell populations during Mtb infection correlating with disease resistance.

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently develops resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, resulting from an immune-excluded microenvironment. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can increase tumor immunogenicity and further augment immune-cell infiltration by releasing immunogenic molecules. Hence, inducing ICD within tumors might be a promising strategy to restore antitumor immunity and sensitize HNSCC to ICB. Herein, we developed shikonin (SHK)-loaded, CGKRK-modified lipid nanoparticles (C-SNPs) and demonstrated that C-SNPs could enrich in tumor cells and induce necroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that C-SNPs suppressed tumor-cell mismatch repair, which later activated the cGAS-mediated IFN response and further increased the expression of PD-L1. Combining C-SNPs with an anti-PD-1 antibody increased the infiltration of DCs and CD8+ T cells, yet the response was limited. Modifying C-SNPs with Mn2+ (C-SMNPs) enhanced the activation of cGAS-STING signaling and further boosted the maturation of DCs and the differentiation of cytotoxic T cells within ICB-treated tumors. Importantly, compared to C-SNPs, the combination of C-SMNPs with ICB resulted in more sustained tumor suppression in vivo. Together, we developed a versatile nanoparticle that delivered SHK and Mn2+ which sensitized HNSCC to ICB by disrupting tumor-cell mismatch repair and boosting the cGAS-STING-mediated IFN response. This nanosized ICD inducer-based strategy holds therapeutic potential in synergizing with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to enhance treatment efficacy in HNSCC.">

Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

Dendritic cells (DC) coordinate antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, and they can be targeted by flaviviruses as a mechanism of immune evasion. Using an unbiased genome-wide approach designed to specifically identify flavivirus-modulated pathways, we found that, while dengue virus (DENV) robustly activates DCs, Zika virus (ZIKV) causes minimal activation of genes involved in DC activation, maturation, and antigen presentation, reducing cytokine secretion and the stimulation of allogeneic and peptide-specific T cell responses. Mechanistically, ZIKV inhibits DC maturation by suppressing NF-κB p65 recruitment and the subsequent transcription of proinflammatory and DC maturation-related genes. Thus, we identify a divergence in the effects of ZIKV and DENV on the host T cell response, highlighting the need to factor such differences into the design of anti-flavivirus vaccines.">

        <tr id="Introduction Recent findings reveal that the precursors of exhausted CD8+ T (CD8+ Tpex) cells possess stem-like signatures in tumor immunity, which originate from tumor draining lymph node (TdLN)-derived tumor-specific memory (CD8+ TTSM) cells. Both of these T subsets can be collectively referred to as stem-like CD8+ T cells, which demonstrate robust self-renewal ability and can proliferate and differentiate into transitory effector-like exhausted T cells (Texint). There are reports that chemotherapeutic drugs can promote the antitumor immune responses of patients by increasing the number of CD8+ T cells; however, whether chemotherapeutic drugs increase these two stem-like CD8+ T cells remain further exploration. Methods Tpex cell-associated subpopulations in human colorectal tumors were analyzed by using single-cell sequencing data. CT26 and B16 tumor models of wild type and Eomes conditional knockout mice were constructed, and the changes of TTSM, Tpex and Tex subsets in mice were dissected by flow cytometry after treatment with decitabine (DAC), doxorubicin (DOX) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Results In this study, we demonstrated that DAC and 5-FU expanded CD8+ TTSM cells in TdLNs. At the same time, we validated that DAC and 5-FU substantially promoted the expansion of CD62L+CD8+ Tpex cells and subsequently increased effector function of CX3CR1+ CD8+ Texint cells. In addition, the conditional knockout of transcription factor Eomes in CD8+ T cells partially eliminated DAC-amplified CD62L+ CD8+ Tpex cells, but had no effect on such CD8+ T subset expanded by 5-FU. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that both DAC and 5-FU promoted the differentiation of stem-like CD8+ TTSM cells in TdLNs and significantly enhanced the differentiation and expansion of stem-like CD62L+ CD8+ Tpex and CX3CR1+ Texint cells in tumor microenvironment. The knockout of Eomes partially influenced the role of DAC in promoting the differentiation and expansion of stem-like CD8+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Programmed Death Receptor-1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on the surface of T cells. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, are among the most widely utilized immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy, dramatically improving the prognosis of patients with various malignancies. Traditionally, platelets, which are cytoplasmic fragments derived from megakaryocytes, have been primarily recognized for their roles in hemostasis and coagulation. However, recent studies have highlighted the emerging role of platelets in cancer biology and therapy. Platelets can modulate immune cell functions through various mechanisms, including the release of bioactive molecules and direct interactions with immune cells. A deeper understanding of the interplay between platelets and immune responses could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment. In our research, in patients with better treatment responses, there are higher levels of mature and activated CD8+ T cells in their PBMCs prior to treatment. Additionally, the activation of platelets is also more pronounced, and the proteins expressed on these platelets may modulate immune cells. After receiving immunotherapy, patients in the responsive (R) group exhibited a higher abundance of activated effector CD8+ T cells, which demonstrated stronger immune response capabilities. Furthermore, the increased levels of activated platelets in the R group may contribute to the regulation of CD8+ effector memory T cells, influencing their quantity and function. Our study suggests that the functional state of CD8+ T cells and the level of activated platelets prior to treatment may serve as predictive indicators for the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in head and neck cancer patients. Activated CD8+ effector T cells may contribute to the differences in immunotherapy responses, with activated platelets playing a role in promoting the maturation and activation of CD8+ effector memory T cells.These insights help better understand the interactions between platelets and immune cells, particularly emphasizing the role of CD8+ effector memory T cells in immunotherapy. Additionally, they offer potential strategies for predicting patient responses to PD-1 inhibitor treatment and optimizing the efficacy of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="The roles of circulating complement C3, produced in hepatocytes, in immune defense are well defined in the literature. Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms.">

        <tr id="Introduction Due to the historical dogma that host defense against intracellular pathogens is primarily mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have long been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence highlights the multifaceted role of B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. B cells accumulate at the site of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity are still being unraveled. In addition to producing antibodies, B cells secrete a wide range of cytokines that can influence the local immune response. In this study, we focused on the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-secreting B cells in the long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Methods B cell-specific IL-10 expression was assessed in IL-10 transcriptional reporter (Vert-X) mice following Mtb infection. To investigate the role of B cell-derived IL-10 in TB immunity, both male and female mice with a targeted knockout of IL-10 in B cells (IL-10flox/CD19cre) were infected with Mtb HN878. Disease progression, control of bacterial replication, and immunological changes were monitored throughout the course of infection. Results B cells contribute to IL-10 production in the Mtb-infected lung in both sexes, with CD138+ plasma cells serving as the primary source of B cell-derived IL-10. Mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 exhibited increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, demonstrated by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was associated with male-specific immune alterations. Conclusion Our research highlights a previously unrecognized sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) reinvigorate strong polyclonal T-cell immune responses against tumor cells. For many patients, these therapies fail because the development of spontaneous immune responses is often compromised, as the tumor microenvironment (TME) lacks proinflammatory signals resulting in suboptimal activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Necroptosis is a special form of programmed cell death associated with leakage of inflammatory factors that can lead to APC maturation. However, it is unclear to which extent functional necroptosis in tumor cells contributes to ICI immunotherapy. Methods With genetically engineered tumor cell lines that lack specific components of the necroptosis machinery (mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)), we addressed the importance of necroptotic tumor cell death for the efficacy of ICI immunotherapy in murine models. Preclinical data were aligned with genome-wide transcriptional programs in patient tumor samples at diagnosis and during ICI treatment for the activity of these pathways and association with treatment outcome. Results Mice bearing MLKL-deficient or RIPK3-deficient tumors failed to control tumor growth in response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, defects in the necroptosis pathway resulted in reduced tumor antigen cross-presentation by type 1 conventional dendritic cells (DCs) in tumor-draining lymph nodes, and subsequently impaired immunotherapy-induced expansion of circulating tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and their accumulation and activation in the TME. In vitro, co-culture of tumor cells undergoing necroptotic but not apoptotic programmed cell death resulted in increased uptake by phagocytic cells, associated with maturation and activation of DCs. Treatment of tumors with the epigenetic modulator azacytidine enhanced intrinsic transcriptional activity of the necroptosis machinery, and hence their susceptibility to ICI immunotherapy. In humans, transcriptome analysis of melanoma samples revealed a strong association between high expression of MLKL and prolonged overall survival and durable clinical response to immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. Conclusions Defective necroptosis signaling in tumor cells is a cancer resistance mechanism to ICI immunotherapy. Reversion of epigenetic silencing of the necroptosis pathway can render tumors susceptible to checkpoint inhibition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT People living with HIV (PLWH) exhibit accelerated aging, characterized by systemic inflammation, termed “inflammaging.” While T-cell expansion is prevalent in PLWH, its connection to inflammaging remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the TCRβ repertoire of 257 healthy controls (HC) and 228 PLWH, revealing pronounced T cell clonal expansion in PLWH. The expansion was only partially reversed following antiretroviral therapy (ART) and closely associated with ART duration, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio. TCR-based age modeling showed a continuous accelerated trajectory of aging in PLWH, especially in younger individuals, in stark contrast to the nonlinear aging acceleration pattern seen in HC. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA combined TCR sequencing and in vitro experiments, we identified GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the primary population driving clonal expansion and maintenance in PLWH. These cells are characterized by high cytotoxicity and low exhaustion and are activated by interleukin-15 (IL-15) in vitro. Notably, GNLY+CD8+ T cells predominantly express the pro-inflammatory 15 kDa form of granulysin(GNLY). The supernatant from IL-15-stimulated CD8+ T cells induces monocytes to secrete inflammatory factors and disrupts the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells, which can be partially restored by the anti-GNLY antibodies. These findings identify GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the central drivers of persistent clonal expansion, highlighting their crucial role for mitigating inflammaging in PLWH.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is a prevalent form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and immune abnormalities play a crucial role in promoting its development. However, the dynamic changes and regulatory characteristics of immune cells during TPE progression remain incompletely understood. This study analyzed DNA methylation and transcriptome data from macrophages and CD4+ T cells from pleural lavage fluid of BCG‐induced tuberculous pleurisy mouse models at specific time points (Days 0, 1, 7, and 14). The results revealed substantial alterations in DNA methylation patterns associated with inflammatory factors and interferon genes. Notably, macrophages exhibited the most pronounced differences in DNA methylation profiles on Day 1, while CD4+ T cells demonstrated gradual changes over time. The investigation further indicated that DNA methylation primarily regulated the differentiation of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells but not Th9 cells. Additionally, single‐cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an increasing expression of C1q during infection, which was regulated by DNA methylation. Importantly, C1q+ and C1q− macrophages demonstrated distinct roles in modulating immune responses during infection. This research provides valuable insights into the DNA methylation profile of immune cells during Mycobacterium bovis infection–induced pleurisy in a mouse model, enhancing our understanding of the upstream regulatory mechanisms underlying immune response development in TPE.">

        <tr id="Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a member of the β-galactoside-binding soluble lectin family, is a double-edged sword in immunity. On one hand, it plays a crucial role in regulating diverse immune cell functions, including the apoptosis of activated T cells. These processes are key in resolving inflammation and preventing autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, Gal-1 has significant implications in cancer, where tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) (e.g., tumor-associated fibroblasts, myeloid-derived suppressor cells) secrete Gal-1 to evade immune surveillance and promote cancer cell growth. Within the TME, Gal-1 enhances the differentiation of tolerogenic dendritic cells, induces the apoptosis of effector T cells, and enhances the proliferation of regulatory T cells, collectively facilitating tumor immune escape. Therefore, targeting Gal-1 holds the potential to boost anti-tumor immunity and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This review provides insights into the intricate role of Gal-1 in immune cell regulation, with an emphasis on T cells, and elucidates how tumors exploit Gal-1 for immune evasion and growth. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of Gal-1 as a therapeutic target to augment current immunotherapies across various cancer types.

However, the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on NSCLC and its impact on tumor immunity. Methods We first established a mouse model of Lewis lung cancer, and administered P. distasonis and intrabitoneal injection of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody to assess the impact of P. distasonis on tumor immunity, and mouse intestinal barrier. Then, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secretion mediated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We used the TLR1/2 complex inhibitor CPT22 to evaluate its effect on macrophage activation. Finally, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secreted by TAM in vivo. Results In vivo, P. distasonis enhanced anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1 in NSCLC mice, improved intestinal barrier integrity, recruited macrophages, and promoted M1 polarization. In vitro, CD86 and iNOS levels in BMDM were elevated and CD206 and Arg1 levels were suppressed in membrane fraction of P. distasonis (PdMb) group in comparison to Control group. With additional CPT22 pre-treatment, the levels of CD86 and iNOS in BMDM were reduced, and the levels of CD206 and Arg1 were increased. Compared to PBS group, P. distasonis group exhibited higher proportion of CD8+T cells in tumor tissues, along with increased positive proportion of GZMB and IFN-γ in CD8+T cells. Additionally, in comparison to Control group, PdMb group showed an elevated proportion of GZMB+T and IFN-γ+T cells within CD8+T cells, and secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and GZMB in CD8+T cell supernatant increased. Moreover, the proportion of CXCL9+F4/80+ macrophages in tumor tissues was higher in P. distasonis group compared to PBS group. In comparison to Control group, CXCL9 protein level in BMDM and CXCL9 secretion level in BMDM supernatant were increased in PdMb group. Finally, P. distasonis enhanced CD8+T cell activity by secreting CXCL9 from macrophages in vivo. Conclusions P. distasonis promoted CXCL9 secretion of TAM and enhanced CD8+T cell activity to trigger anti-tumor immunity against anti-PD-1 treatment in NSCLC mice.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Mechanisms underlying the T-cell-dependent anti-cancer effect of cyclophosphamide (CTX) are not fully understood. We found that CTX chemotherapy induces long-term survival of mice bearing metastasized breast cancer with chromosomal instability. Given that CTX induces DNA damage and type I interferon (IFN-I) in vivo and that cGAS senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA, we investigated the role of the host cGAS–STING–IFN-I pathway in CTX therapy. We found that CD8+ T cells, the cGAS of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, the STING of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), and the IFN-I response of non-cDC1 myeloid cells are essential for CTX efficacy. Moreover, the cGAS and STING of BM-derived cells positively modulate intratumoral CD8+ T cell populations. Our study shows that the T-cell-dependent anti-tumor effect of CTX critically involves the cGAS–STING–IFN-I axis, the IFN-I response, and the STING-independent cGAS function of host myeloid cells, which supports the deployment of CTX in treating advanced solid tumors by bypassing the often-failed IFN-I production by tumor cells due to a chronic activation of the intrinsic cGAS–STING caused by chromosomal instability.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="T cell engagers (TCEs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the treatment of B and plasma cell malignancies and are emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid tumors. These molecules harness T cells to bind to and eliminate cancer cells, effectively bypassing the need for antigen-specific T cell recognition. Despite their established clinical efficacy, a subset of patients is either refractory to TCE treatment (e.g. primary resistance) or develops resistance during the course of TCE therapy (e.g. acquired or treatment-induced resistance). In this review we comprehensively describe the resistance mechanisms to TCEs, occurring in both preclinical models and clinical trials with a particular emphasis on cellular and molecular pathways underlying the resistance process. We classify these mechanisms into tumor intrinsic and tumor extrinsic ones. Tumor intrinsic mechanisms encompass changes within tumor cells that impact the T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, including tumor antigen loss, the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory ligands and intracellular pathways that render tumor cells resistant to killing. Tumor extrinsic mechanisms involve factors external to tumor cells, including the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and reduced T cell functionality. We further propose actionable strategies to overcome resistance offering potential avenues for enhancing TCE efficacy in the clinic.">

        <tr id="Background Tumors often evade immune surveillance by limiting T cell infiltration. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells is associated with a favorable response to immunotherapy. While BIN1 is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment in NSCLC has yet to be fully clarified. Methods To investigate the relationship between BIN1 expression and CD8+T cell infiltration in NSCLC, we performed a comprehensive data analysis utilizing clinical information from NSCLC patients. BIN1 expression levels in NSCLC tissues were evaluated, and their correlation with CD8+T cells infiltration and patient survival outcomes was examined. Loss-of-function strategies targeting BIN1 were applied in syngeneic NSCLC mouse models to assess its functional significance. Tumor growth was monitored, and immune cell populations were analyzed in terms of frequency and functionality through mass cytometry and flow cytometry techniques. Cytokine secretion was profiled using multiplex assays. Additionally, RNA sequencing, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, and molecular docking were employed to confirm direct interactions between BIN1 and cytokine-encoding genes. Finally, the regulatory role of BIN1 in ferroptosis in NSCLC cells were explored using metabolomics analysis, ROS measurement, and MDA detection. Results We observed that BIN1 expression is downregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues, with its reduced expression strongly associated with advanced disease progression and poor prognosis. Bioinformatics analysis of immune infiltration in human NSCLC samples revealed a positive correlation between BIN1 expression in NSCLC tissues and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Furthermore, the prognostic impact of BIN1 on NSCLC patients is strongly linked to the level of CD8+ T cell infiltration. In syngeneic mouse models, the knockout of BIN1 in NSCLC cells significantly inhibited CD8+ T cell infiltration and impaired their cytotoxic function, facilitating tumor immune evasion. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BIN1 directly interacts with G3BP1, and its knockout stabilizes G3BP1. This, in turn, promotes STAT1 degradation and reduces the secretion of T cell-recruiting chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL5. Finally, our findings reveal that BIN1 influences ferroptosis in NSCLC cells through the G3BP1/STAT1/GSH pathway, thereby regulating NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusion This study highlights the crucial role of the BIN1/G3BP1/STAT1/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte signaling pathway in the progression of NSCLC and its mechanisms of immune evasion. This fundings lay a foundation for the development of BIN1-targeted therapies aimed at improving tumor immunogenicity and transforming immunologically “cold” NSCLC into a more responsive disease.

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) are the current standard treatments for patients with aplastic anemia (AA). However, IST also carries significant risks and side effects, and up to 30–50% of patients experienced refractory or relapsed disease following IST. Treating AA remains challenging and novel efficient therapies are in critical need. The IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) plays a crucial role in the T cell response and functions as a regulator of T cell activity. While ITK inhibition has shown promise in various immune-related disorders, its potential role in the pathophysiology of AA has not been thoroughly investigated. We observed elevated level of phosphorylated ITK in T cells from AA patients and AA mouse models. Moreover, we found that both treatment with an ITK inhibitor or conditional depletion of Itk in donor mice alleviated bone marrow hypoplasia, improved cytopenia, and extended survival rates. Notably, ITK inhibition orchestrates T cell quantity and function by reducing T cell infiltration and suppressing the secretion of key inflammatory cytokines in AA mice. Our data suggest that ITK inhibitor could potentially offer a new therapeutic strategy for AA.

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors, enhancing clinical outcomes by releasing T cells from inhibitory effects of receptors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Despite these advancements, achieving durable antitumor responses remains challenging, often due to additional immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive TME and play a pivotal role in shaping T cell-mediated antitumor responses. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), expressed on myeloid cells, including TAMs, is an inhibitory receptor, which contributes to macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. In this study, we present AZD2796, a high-affinity anti-LILRB2 antibody designed to repolarize TAMs from an immunosuppressive to a proinflammatory phenotype. Methods Anti-LILRB2 antibodies were identified using single-B-cell encapsulation Immune Replica technology. The ability of AZD2796 to enhance proinflammatory responses from macrophages treated with CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide was assessed using a macrophage stimulation assay. A tumor cell/macrophage/T cell co-culture assay was developed to evaluate the effect of AZD2796, as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, on the cytolytic activity of antigen-specific T cells. In vivo assessments were then carried out to determine the ability of AZD2796 to alter tumor growth rate in mice humanized with CD34 hematopoietic stem cells. Results In preclinical assessments, AZD2796 skewed macrophage differentiation away from an immunosuppressive phenotype and enhanced the proinflammatory function of macrophages. AZD2796 significantly increased the anti-tumor response of T cells following PD-1 checkpoint blockade, while AZD2796 monotherapy reduced tumor growth in humanized mouse models. Conclusions These findings support the potential of AZD2796 as an anti-cancer therapy, with the ability to synergize with T-cell-based therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Th17 cells can perform either regulatory or inflammatory functions depending on the cytokine microenvironment. These plastic cells can transdifferentiate into Tregs during inflammation resolution, in allogenic heart transplantation models, or in cancer through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that NLRP3 expression in Th17 cells is essential for maintaining their immunosuppressive functions through an inflammasome-independent mechanism. In the absence of NLRP3, Th17 cells produce more inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, Granzyme B, TNFα) and exhibit reduced immunosuppressive activity toward CD8+ cells. Moreover, the capacity of NLRP3-deficient Th17 cells to transdifferentiate into Treg-like cells is lost. Mechanistically, NLRP3 in Th17 cells interacts with the TGF-β receptor, enabling SMAD3 phosphorylation and thereby facilitating the acquisition of immunosuppressive functions. Consequently, the absence of NLRP3 expression in Th17 cells from tumor-bearing mice enhances CD8 + T-cell effectiveness, ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.">

        <tr id="Background A subset of CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic activity has been identified, and these cells exert their effects by expressing perforin and granzymes. Despite the progress made in characterizing cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in various diseases, the status of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying mechanisms involved in promoting intratumoral cytotoxic CD4+ T-cell activation remain unclear. Methods We used flow cytometry to examine the phenotypic and functional properties of CD4+GzmB+ T cells in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC. Loss-of-function analyses and RNA sequencing were used to identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the effects of interleukin (IL)-15 on the restoration of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell function in vitro. A patient-derived lung cancer explant model and an animal model were used to verify the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on CD4+GzmB+ T-cell activation. Results In patients with NSCLC, impaired cytolytic function of tumor-infiltrated granzyme B (GzmB)-expressing CD4+ T cells was restored by IL-15 through activation of the AKT-FOXO1-T-bet axis. Moreover, IL-15 stimulation increased solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) expression in CD4+GzmB+ T cells in an Protein Kinase B (AKT)-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC7A5 abrogated the effect of IL-15 on CD4+GzmB+ T cells. Additionally, we showed that the immune checkpoint molecules programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and CD85j were mutually exclusively expressed in CD4+GzmB+ T cells and that dual targeting of PD-1 and CD85j enhanced the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells by activating the AKT pathway. Notably, tumor cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II and IL-15 determine the effectiveness of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity in response to immunotherapy. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating CD4+GzmB+ T cells fail to eliminate tumors. Dual blockade of PD-1 and CD85j alongside IL-15 restores the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells and drives CD4+GzmB+ T-cell transformation in the tumor microenvironment to combat MHC-II-expressing tumors.">

        <tr id="Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by heterogeneity in individual responses to therapy. The heterogeneous phenotypes and crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in immunotherapy resistance remain largely unclear. Methods A specific CAF subset was identified by integrating comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and transcriptome profiling of patients with HCC with different responses to antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Mouse orthotopic HCC models and a coculture system were constructed, and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis was performed to investigate the functions and mechanisms of specific CAFs in the immune context of HCC. Results We identified a distinct flavin-containing monooxygenase 2 (FMO2)+ CAF subset associated with a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy and better clinical outcomes. FMO2+ CAFs increase anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy by promoting tertiary lymphoid structure formation and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1-like macrophages through the C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19)-C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 axis. Mechanistically, FMO2 promotes nuclear factor kappa B/p65-mediated CCL19 expression by competitively binding to glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) with praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1 (PJA1), thereby suppressing the PJA1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GYS1. CCL19 treatment potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse orthotopic HCC models. A favorable immunotherapy response was observed in patients with HCC with high serum levels of CCL19. Conclusions We identified a novel FMO2+ CAF subset that serves as a critical regulator of microenvironmental immune properties and a predictive biomarker of the immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. CCL19 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.">

This study investigated the role of CD31+ immune cells, specifically macrophages and T cells, in the glioma microenvironment through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods We employed the CellChat framework to map cell-cell communication pathways and used Monocle3 for pseudotime trajectory analysis to characterize the signaling and developmental progressions within CD31+ cells. Pathways such as osteopontin (SPP1) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) were analyzed in terms of their role in immune regulation, and we examined the expression of ferritin, an iron-binding protein, to assess its potential function in modulating CD31+ cell activity. Results Our findings highlight the expression of key pathways, including SPP1 and MHC-II, influencing immune regulation. Ferritin was found to be highly expressed in CD31+ cells, suggesting a dual role in iron metabolism and immune modulation within the glioma microenvironment. Conclusions This study clarified the distinct roles of CD31+ immune cells in glioma progression and identified ferritin as a potential therapeutic target for modulating immune responses in gliomas. These findings may offer new directions in glioma research and the development of immunotherapy, which can aid in improving treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has emerged as a pivotal advancement in cancer treatment, yet its efficacy varies among patients and resistance can develop. This study focuses on TIGIT, a newly identified immune checkpoint, to explore its expression, prognostic significance, and therapeutic potential in hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we found TIGIT highest expression levels in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, with enrichment in immune cells such as NK-T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). A prognostic model incorporating TIGIT expression and other immune-related genes effectively stratified AML patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the former displaying significantly shorter overall survival times. Our model outperformed traditional prognostic factors, highlighting TIGIT’s potential as a superior predictive biomarker. Additionally, our in vitro and in vivo studies showed that combining tiragolumab with azacitidine (AZA) synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, reducing tumor burden and extending survival in a murine AML model. Our findings underscore TIGIT’s role in hematologic malignancies and its potential as a therapeutic target in AML. The combination of AZA with TIGIT inhibition offers a promising new approach for AML treatment, warranting further clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="Objectives To explore the phenotype and role of gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Methods Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR were employed to analyze γδ T cell subsets, chemokine receptor expression, cytokine production, pro-fibrotic gene expression, and transcription factor profiles. Immunofluorescence assessed Vδ2 T cell infiltration in affected tissues. Chemotaxis assays and co-culture experiments investigated Vδ2 T cell migration and their influence on B cell differentiation. The impact of IL-21 stimulation and JAK/STAT3 inhibitors on γδ T cell was also evaluated. Results Patients with IgG4-RD exhibited decreased peripheral Vδ2 T cells displaying a Th2-like phenotype characterized by elevated Th2 cytokine production and activated IL-21—STAT3—Blimp-1—GATA3 pathway. Vδ2 T cells accumulated in affected tissues through CCR7 upregulation, and co-localizing with B cells. Both Vδ2 T cells and culture supernatants from IgG4-RD patients promoted B cell differentiation. IL-21 stimulation augmented pSTAT3, Blimp-1, and GATA3 expression in Vδ2 T cells, while JAK and STAT3 inhibitors attenuated these effects. IgG4-RD patients exhibited increased TGF-β and pro-fibrotic gene expression in γδ T cells. Conclusion Within the IL-21-rich microenvironment of IgG4-RD, peripheral Vδ2 T cells acquire a Th2-like phenotype via the IL-21—STAT3—Blimp-1—GATA3 pathway. Targeting JAK/STAT3 inhibitors holds therapeutic potential for IgG4-RD.">

        <tr id="Newborns exhibit a heightened vulnerability to inflammatory disorders due to their underdeveloped immune system, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report that plasma spermidine is correlated with the maturity of human newborns and reduced risk of inflammation. Administration of spermidine led to the remission of neonatal inflammation in mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that spermidine enhanced the generation of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) via downstream eIF5A hypusination. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), a key enzyme of hypusinated eIF5A (eIF5AHyp), diminished the immunosuppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs, leading to aggravated neonatal inflammation. The eIF5AHyp pathway was found to enhance the immunosuppressive function via histone acetylation–mediated epigenetic transcription of immunosuppressive signatures in PMN-MDSCs. These findings demonstrate the spermidine-eIF5AHyp metabolic axis as a master switch to restrict neonatal inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Ageing-associated remodeling of the murine B cell system is accompanied with a reduction of CD19+ B cells such as follicular B cells (FOB) and an accumulation of age-associated B cells (ABC) or activated B cell subsets. This remodeling is thought to confer an attenuated antibody response, such as to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) vaccines in both aged mice and humans. To gain insight into the de novo development and function of an old B cell system, we reconstituted young and old immune systems by transferring hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from immune-competent young (2–3 months) CD45.1+ donors (DY-HSC) or old (20–24 months) donors (DO-HSC) into T and B cell-deficient young recipient CD45.2+ RAG1−/− mice, followed by protein-based vaccination. Results In the same environment of young RAG1−/− mice, transplanted DO-HSCs compared to DY-HSCs reconstituted lower numbers of CD19+ B cells and CD45.1+ cells, though the engraftment of donor-derived HSCs in the young bone marrow (BM) was very similar. Furthermore, indicative for youthful and unchallenged B cell systems, and in contrast to aged mice, very low levels of antigen-experienced memory B cells or age-associated B cells (ABC) developed in both DY-HSC and DO-HSC hosts. The commercially available recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) induced lower IgG+ S-antibody titers and pseudovirus neutralization activity in old compared to young mice. In contrast, very similar high IgG+ S-antibody titers were induced in DO-HSC and DY-HSC hosts, and pseudovirus neutralization activity was even enhanced in DO-HSC compared with DY-HSC hosts. Conclusions Both DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs established in the young recipient BM to a similar extend, suggesting that the concomitant reduction in the de novo reconstitution of CD19+ B cells in DO-HSC vs. DY-HSC transplanted animals is specifically related to old HSCs. DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs reconstitute very similar unchallenged B cell systems that efficiently elicit antigen-specific IgG antibodies by protein-based vaccination. Old HSCs thus retain competence to reconstitute a youthful and functional B cell system, at least in the young environment of transplanted RAG1−/− mice. This suggests that it is primarily age-related factors, and not HSCs per se, that influence the composition and functionality of the old B cell system.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse is associated with poor prognosis. While natural killer (NK) cell therapy can induce leukemia remission, infused NK cells are prone to exhaustion. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving NK cell exhaustion in AML patients could provide critical insights for developing novel strategies to optimize NK cell-based immunotherapies. In this study, we systematically investigated NK cell exhaustion in relapsed AML patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) through phenotypic assessments, functional assays, and RNA sequencing analyses. Compared to NK cells from complete remission patients and healthy controls, NK cells from relapsed AML patients exhibited an exhausted phenotype, marked by reduced maturity, elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, impaired cytotoxicity, and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Notably, NKG2A expression levels on NK cells correlated with disease progression. Blockade or genetic knockout of NKG2A effectively reversed NK cell exhaustion both in vitro and in an AML mouse model. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in exhausted NK cells. We found that excessive activation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis was associated with PI3K-AKT pathway inhibition, and blocking the NKG2A/HLA-E interaction or knocking out NKG2A restored AKT phosphorylation in exhausted NK cells. In summary, AML cells drive NK cell exhaustion through overactivation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Targeting the NKG2A/HLA-E axis represents a promising therapeutic approach to restore PI3K-AKT signaling and reverse NK cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="γδT cells represent a unique and versatile subset of T cells characterized by the expression of T-cell receptors (TCRs) composed of γ and δ chains. Unlike conventional αβT cells, γδT cells do not require major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent antigen presentation for activation, enabling them to recognize and respond to a wide array of antigens, including phosphoantigens, stress-induced ligands, and tumor-associated antigens. While γδT cells are relatively rare in peripheral blood, they are enriched in peripheral tissues such as the skin, intestine, and lung. These cells play a crucial role in tumor immunotherapy by exerting direct cytotoxicity through the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-17 (IL-17)) and cytotoxic molecules (e.g., perforin and granzyme). Recent advances in γδT cell research have elucidated their mechanisms of tumor recognition, including the detection of phosphoantigens and stress-induced ligands like MICA (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A), MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B), and ULBP (UL16-binding protein). Furthermore, various strategies to enhance γδT cell-based tumor immunotherapy have been developed, such as in vitro expansion using phosphoantigen-based therapies, cytokine stimulation, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδT cell engineering. These advancements have shown promising results in both preclinical and clinical settings, paving the way for γδT cells to become a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Upon activation, B cells undergo either the germinal center (GC) or extrafollicular (EF) response. While GC are known to generate high‐affinity memory B cells and long‐lived plasma cells, the role of the EF response is less well understood. Initially, it was thought to be limited to that of a source of fast but lower‐quality antibodies until the GC can form. However, recent evidence strongly supports the EF response as an important component of the humoral response to infection. EF responses are now also recognized as a source of pathogenic B cells in autoimmune diseases. The EF response itself is dynamic and regulated by pathways that are only recently being uncovered. We have identified that the cytokine IL‐12 acts as a molecular switch, enhancing the EF response and suppressing GC through multiple mechanisms. These include direct effects on both B cells themselves and the coordinated differentiation of helper CD4 T cells. Here, we explore this pathway in relation to other recent advancements in our understanding of the EF response's role and highlight areas for future research. A better understanding of how the EF response forms and is regulated is essential for advancing treatments for many disease states.">

While exhaustion is driven by chronic antigen exposure in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, leading to a reversible state of diminished functionality, senescence reflects a more permanent, age‐ or stress‐induced arrest in cellular proliferation and effector capacity. Together, these processes represent formidable barriers to sustained anti‐tumor immunity. In this review, we dissect the molecular underpinnings of T cell exhaustion and senescence, revealing how these dysfunctions synergistically contribute to immune evasion and resistance across a range of solid tumors. We explore cutting‐edge therapeutic approaches aimed at rewiring the exhausted and senescent T cell phenotypes. These include advances in immune checkpoint blockade, the engineering of “armored” CAR‐T cells, senolytic therapies that selectively eliminate senescent cells, and novel interventions that reinvigorate the immune system's capacity for tumor eradication. By spotlighting emerging strategies that target both exhaustion and senescence, we provide a forward‐looking perspective on the potential to harness immune rejuvenation. This comprehensive review outlines the next frontier in cancer immunotherapy: unlocking durable responses by overcoming the immune system's intrinsic aging and exhaustion, ultimately paving the way for transformative therapeutic breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by dysregulated megakaryopoiesis and neoplastic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion. Using a murine model with MK-specific JAK2V617F expression, we establish an MPN aging model where mutant MKs drive HSC expansion and a progressive decline in wild-type HSC function. Compared to wild-type MKs, JAK2V617F MKs exhibit heightened inflammation and innate immune activation with aging, including increased antigen presentation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, skewed T cell populations, and impaired T cell functions in the marrow niche. Enhanced MK immunomodulatory function is linked to mutant cell expansion and MPN progression in a chimeric murine model with co-existing wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant HSCs. LINE-1 (long-interspersed element-1), a retrotransposon linked to innate immune activation and aging, is upregulated in mutant MKs during aging in murine models. We validated that LINE-1–encoded protein ORF1p is expressed in marrow MKs in 12 of 13 MPN patients but absent in control samples from patients undergoing orthopedic surgery (n=5). These findings suggest that MKs reprogram the marrow immune microenvironment, impairing normal HSC function while promoting neoplastic expansion in MPNs. LINE-1 activation in mutant MKs may be a key driver of immune dysregulation in MPNs. Key Points JAK2V617F mutant MKs reprogram the marrow immune microenvironment to promote neoplastic HSC expansion in MPNs. LINE-1 activation in diseased MKs triggers chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction in MPNs.">

        <tr id="Background CD169+ macrophages in lymph nodes (LNs) activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which play a crucial role in anticancer immunity, through antigen presentation and co-stimulation by CD169. Interferon alpha (IFNα) is capable of inducing the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages; however, its clinical applications have been hindered by pharmacokinetic limitations—low LN distribution and an inability to target macrophages. To overcome these issues, this study genetically fused mouse IFNα (mIFNα) with mannosylated mouse serum albumin (Man-MSA), and investigated the antitumor effects of the hybrid protein (Man-MSA-mIFNα) or its add-on effects with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade. Methods To confirm the possibility of CD169+ macrophage-mediated T cell priming, positional information about individual immune cells in LNs of cancer patients was obtained. Traits of Man-MSA-mIFNα, which was prepared using Pichia pastoris to form the high-mannose structure, were characterized by several physicochemical methods. To evaluate the lymphatic drainage of Man-MSA-mIFNα, radioiodine or Cy5-labeled Man-MSA-mIFNα was subcutaneously administered in mice, and then the radioactivity or fluorescence in LNs was analyzed. CD169-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (CD169-DTR) mice in which LN CD169+ macrophages can be depleted by DT injection were used to verify whether the antitumor effect of Man-MSA-mIFNα is dependent on LN CD169+ macrophages. Results Multiplex tissue imaging predicted close proximity of CD169+ macrophages and T cells and positive correlation between the number of CD169+ macrophages and T cells in neighborhoods in LNs of cancer patients. Physicochemical analyses showed that Man-MSA-mIFNα was formed from the fusion of the intact Man-MSA and mIFNα. Man-MSA-mIFNα efficiently induced the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages by its high LN distribution and macrophage-targeting capability, and significantly exerted antitumor activity through CD8+ T cell activation in the LNs, whereas its antitumor effects were canceled in CD169-DTR mice. Finally, combination therapy with PD-L1 blockade markedly suppressed tumor growth in MB49-bearing mice, which exhibit resistance to PD-L1 blockade monotherapy. Conclusions The present study successfully designed and developed Man-MSA-mIFNα, which efficiently induces the CD169+ phenotype in LN macrophages, contributing to the antitumor immunity. The findings suggest that our novel strategy targeting CD169⁺ macrophages could be a promising immunotherapy for cancer patients who are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal cancer of the central nervous system, presenting substantial treatment challenges. The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. It also summarizes recent progress in TAM-targeted therapies, which may, in combination with other treatments like immunotherapy, pave the way for more effective and personalized strategies against this aggressive malignancy.">

The TME plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulating processes such as cancer cell migration, proliferation, tumor vascularization, and the modulation of anti-cancer immune responses. 2 Effects of the TME are partially mediated by secreted factors, including exosomes, metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and a remodeled extracellular matrix produced by CAFs, which profoundly in ﬂ uence cancer progression. 2 Numerous studies revealed that the TME plays a pivotal role in modulating anti-cancer immune responses, either promoting or suppressing these processes in a manner that appears highly context-dependent. 3 Effective immune responses against cancer cells basically involve three different key mechanisms.

Little is known about the precise nature of the anti-cancer immune response triggered by different natural DC subsets and their relevance in preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. Here, we use mouse splenic conventional DC1s (cDC1s) or cDC2s pulsed with tumor cell lysates to generate DC vaccines. cDC1-based vaccination induces a stronger effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ anti-tumor T cell response, leading to a better control of tumors treated either therapeutically or prophylactically. Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4+ tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8+ memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4+ Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma. Our findings suggest that cDC1-based vaccination excels at immune memory induction and prevention of cancer recurrence.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are critical for the maintenance of self‐tolerance, and their absence or dysfunction can result in autoimmunity. To determine the critical cell type controlled by Treg and potentially the suppressor mechanism utilized by Treg in the steady state, we utilized mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) exclusively on Treg cells. Complete depletion of Treg was achieved 24 h after DT treatment, but profound activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as measured by induction of CD44 expression and proliferation required 3–4 days. Increased expression of CD80/CD86 was observed on dendritic cells and more prominently on macrophages after 3 days. Depletion of CD4+ T cells or macrophages resulted in ∼50% inhibition of T‐cell activation. The initial steps in T‐cell activation were completely independent of IFN‐γ or IL‐2, while upregulation of CD80/CD86 was partially dependent on IFN‐γ. Complete reversal of immune activation post‐Treg depletion was only achieved by blockade of CD80/CD86 interactions with CD28. We conclude that the major mechanism used by Treg in the steady state is the regulation of CD80/CD86 expression and dysregulation of this suppressor pathway results in lethal autoimmunity driven by co‐stimulatory signals in concert with TCR stimulation, or even by costimulatory signals alone.">

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Nature , Breart et al. 1 untangled the controversy surrounding interleukin (IL)-27 ’ s role in regulating T cell differentiation and immune responses in cancer. Their ﬁ ndings reveal that IL-27 enhances the persistence and effector functions of tumor-in ﬁ ltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (TILs), preventing exhaustion, sustaining T cell-dependent tumor control and immunotherapy ef ﬁ cacy without signi ﬁ cant systemic side effects. Effective immune control of cancer relies on the ability of T lymphocytes to in ﬁ ltrate tumors and exert their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, surviving neoplastic cells promptly adapt to immune-patrolled environments and evolve under immune system pressure to progressively avoid immune clearance, establishing immune-privileged conditions that sustain limitless growth. These immune evasive strategies are deployed in 3 main routes: “ camou ﬂ age ” (reduced immunogenicity and immune exclusion), “ coercion ” (impaired local immune activation through the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment [TME]), “ cytoprotection ” (avoiding neoplastic cell killing through intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms). 2 Therapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoints and aiming to restore cancer immune surveillance signi ﬁ cantly improved the survival and life quality of cancer patients, although their ef ﬁ cacy is restricted to a fraction of patients and tumor types. Breart et al. attempted to identify novel, actionable immunological targets by charting the cytokines, which are known to be the most potent immune system regulators.

The pathogenesis of MDS is influenced by intrinsic factors, such as genetic insults, and extrinsic factors, including altered bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) composition and architecture. BMM is reprogrammed in MDS, initially to prevent the development of the disease but eventually to provide a survival advantage to dysplastic cells. Recently, inflammation or age-related inflammation in the bone marrow has been identified as a key pathogenic mechanism for MDS. Inflammatory signals trigger stress hematopoiesis, causing HSPCs to emerge from quiescence and resulting in MDS development. A better understanding of the role of the BMM in the pathogenesis of MDS has opened up new avenues for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge regarding the significance of the BMM to MDS pathophysiology and highlights recent advances in developing innovative therapies.">

        <tr id="Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) play a crucial role in modulating tumor immune responses and influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, our current understanding of the microenvironment within these lymph nodes remains limited. Tumors not only impair the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment, but they also facilitate immune evasion and promote metastasis by altering the structure and function of TDLNs. Research has shown that tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells (TTSM) within TDLNs are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockers. Moreover, the abnormal structure of TDLNs, along with the presence of immunosuppressive cells—such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), and immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs)—contributes to tumor-mediated immune evasion. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the immune microenvironment within TDLNs is essential for improving the effectiveness of immunotherapies and developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review explores various TDLN-based therapeutic strategies, addressing the controversies surrounding lymph node dissection, the use of TDLNs as a source of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for therapy, targeting immunosuppressive cells within TDLNs, and methods to reverse the structural abnormalities of TDLNs. These strategies offer valuable insights and potential directions for advancing tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic cell-based immunotherapies, particularly CAR-T cell therapy, represent a significant advancement in cancer treatment, offering scalable and consistent alternatives to autologous therapies. However, their widespread use is limited by the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of GvHD in the context of allogeneic cell-based cancer immunotherapy and evaluates current strategies to mitigate its effects. Key strategies include genetic engineering approaches such as T cell receptor (TCR) knockout (KO) and T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) CAR knock-in. Alternative immune cell types like natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells offer potential solutions due to their lower alloreactivity. Additionally, stem cell technology, utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), enables standardized and scalable production of engineered CAR-T cells. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies, such as UCART19 and CTX110, demonstrate promising results in preventing GvHD while maintaining anti-tumor efficacy. The review also addresses manufacturing considerations for allogeneic cell products and the challenges in translating preclinical findings into clinical success. By addressing these challenges, allogeneic cell-based immunotherapy continues to advance, paving the way for more accessible, scalable, and effective cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Background The role of T cell immunity during antineoplastic therapy is poorly understood. In the BEGYN-1 study, patients with breast cancer underwent quarterly assessments prior to and during antineoplastic therapy over a period of 12 months. Methods We used flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays to quantify 25 T cell subpopulations and seven T cell associated plasma cytokines in peripheral blood from 92 non-metastatic breast cancer patients, respectively. In addition, the association between T cell dynamics and the outcome of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was investigated. Results In patients undergoing chemotherapy, a significant reduction in T helper (Th) cells, particularly naïve central and effector cells and thymus positive Th cells, was observed over time. Interestingly, Th1 immune response-associated cytokines (IL-12, TNF, IFN-γ) declined while Th2 cells and cytotoxic T cells increased over time. Conclusions We conclude that in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy is associated with a transition from a Th1 immune response towards Th2 and an increase in cytotoxic T cells, whereas in patients without chemotherapy, these alterations were less pronounced. Future studies should clarify whether patterns of T cell subsets or plasma cytokines can be used as biomarkers to monitor or even improve therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="As the second most common non-melanoma skin cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has experienced a significant increase in incidence. Although clinical detection is relatively easy, a considerable number of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, featuring local tissue infiltration and distant metastasis. Cemiplimab, along with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, enhances T cell activation by blocking the PD-1 pathway, resulting in notable improvements in clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, approximately 50% of the patients with advanced cSCC remain unresponsive to this therapeutic approach. It emphasizes the importance of finding innovative therapeutic targets and strategies to boost the success of immunotherapy across a wider range of patients. Therefore, we focused on frequently neglected functions of innate immune cells. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immune cells exhibit considerable heterogeneity and plasticity, fundamentally contributing to tumor initiation and development. The identification and eradication of cancer cells, along with the modulation of adaptive immune responses, are essential roles of these cells. Consequently, targeting innate immune cells to activate anti-tumor immune responses presents significant potential for enhancing immunotherapeutic strategies in cSCC.">

        <tr id="Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), professional type I interferon (IFN) producing cells, have been implicated in host responses against bacterial infections. However, their role in host defense is debated and the operating molecular mechanisms are unknown. Certain Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule Family (SLAMF) members act as microbial sensors and modulate immune functions in response to infection. Here by analyzing multiple human blood transcriptomic datasets, we report the involvement of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in many infectious diseases, with elevated levels associated with type I IFN responses in salmonellosis and brucellosis patients. We further identify SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 as key regulators of human pDC function. Silencing of these receptors hinders pDC maturation and abrogates cytokine production during infection with acute (Salmonella) or chronic (Brucella) inflammation-inducing bacteria. Mechanistically, we show that SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 signal through NF-κB, IRF7 and STAT-1, and limit mitochondrial ROS accumulation upon Salmonella infection. This SLAMF7/8-dependent control of mitochondrial ROS levels favors bacterial persistence and NF-κB activation. Overall, our results unravel essential shared roles of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in finely tuning human pDC responses to intracellular bacterial infections with high diagnosis and therapeutic perspectives.">

        <tr id="Background: α-Galactosylceramide (α-Galcer), a specific ligand for invariant natural killer T (NKT) cell activation, has been actively investigated in clinical trials such as antitumor therapy; however, treatment with α-Galcer is well known to induce acute hepatitis due to enriched NKT cells in the liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying NKT-mediated hepatitis still remain obscure. The object of this study was to investigate whether and how myeloid cells affect NKT-mediated hepatitis. Methods: α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis was used in this study. microRNA-223 (miR-223) and neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1)–deficent mice were generated and subjected to α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis. Results: In this study, we demonstrated that α-Galcer–induced NKT cell activation resulted in neutrophil and monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation in the liver. Importantly, serum levels of several hepatic myeloid cell infiltration–related cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated after α-Galcer administration. Among these myeloid cells, blockade of neutrophil or macrophage migration through using different inhibitors of (C-X-C Motif) receptor 2, (C-C motif) receptor 2, and (C-C motif) receptor 5 signaling ameliorated α-Galcer–induced liver injury, mainly due to the decrease of reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. Depletion of neutrophils reduced α-Galcer–induced liver injury and hepatitis. Interestingly, genetic deletion of neutrophil-specific miR-223 markedly enhanced while Ncf﻿1﻿ deficiency significantly ameliorated liver inflammation and oxidative damage caused by α-Galcer. Conclusions: Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration through multiple inflammatory mediators is required for NKT cell activation–induced hepatitis, which sheds light on the myeloid cell infiltration–related molecular mechanisms of NKT cell–mediated liver injury. Our study may provide a novel therapeutical strategy for the treatment of NKT cell hepatitis.">

        <tr id="Lactate has emerged as a key regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing both tumor progression and immune dynamics. As a byproduct of aerobic glycolysis, lactate satisfies the metabolic needs of proliferating tumor cells while reshaping the TME to facilitate immune evasion. Elevated lactate levels inhibit effector immune cells such as CD8+ T and natural killer cells, while supporting immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thus fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Lactate promotes epigenetic reprogramming, stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and activates nuclear factor kappa B, leading to further immunological dysfunction. In this review, we examined the role of lactate in metabolic reprogramming, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism, including lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors, and TME neutralization methods, all of which can restore immune function and enhance immunotherapy outcomes. By highlighting recent advances, this review provides a theoretical foundation for integrating lactate-targeted therapies into clinical practice. We also highlight the potential synergy between these therapies and current immunotherapeutic strategies, providing new avenues for addressing TME-related challenges and improving outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with high resistance and recurrence rates, with only one fifth of patients eligible for surgical treatment. The disease resists standard chemotherapy and often relapses. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promise for hematological malignancies but faces challenges in solid tumors due to resistance mechanisms like PD-L1 expression, which tumors use to evade the immune system. To address this challenge, we developed fifth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 that also secrete anti-PD-L1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to target both tumor cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. We examined integrin αvβ6 and PD-L1 expression in CCA cell lines and engineered T cells to express either fourth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 (A20 CAR4 T cells) or fifth-generation CAR T cells with anti-PD-L1 scFv secretion (A20 CAR5 T cells). In vitro, A20 CAR5 T cells exhibited less exhaustion and superior long-term functionality compared to A20 CAR4 T cells. In 3D spheroid models of CCA, A20 CAR5 T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity and better infiltration into the spheroid core. These findings suggest that A20 CAR5 T cells have significant potential and warrant further in vivo studies and clinical trials.

In a murine model of sepsis that recapitulates immune alterations observed in patients, here we demonstrate that PD-L1+CD44+B220LowCD138+IgM+ regulatory plasma cells are induced in spleen and regulate ex vivo proliferation and IFNɣ secretion induced by stimulation of T splenocytes. This effect is mediated both by cell-cell contact through increased PD-L1 expression on plasma cells and by production of a soluble factor. These observations are recapitulated in three cohorts of critically ill patients with bacterial and viral sepsis in association with increased mortality. Our findings thus reveal the function of regulatory plasma cells in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced immune alterations, and present a potential therapeutic target for improving immune cell function impaired by sepsis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Only a minority of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) respond favourably to immunotherapy. The oral oncogenic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum) was recently observed to suppress the anti‐tumour immune response, although the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from F.nucleatum (F.n‐OMVs) promoted HNSCC progression by inducing immunosuppressive phenotypes of tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in decreased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration in vivo. Mechanistically, TAMs internalized tryptophanase presented in F.n‐OMVs, which activated the tryptophan‐2,3‐dioxygenase 2/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (TDO2/AHR) pathway and upregulated the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoints. TDO2 inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti‐programmed death‐1 in a tumour‐bearing mouse model. Both TDO2 and F.nucleatum demonstrated excellent performance in predicting the immunotherapy outcomes in patients with HNSCC. These results indicate that F.n‐OMVs induce immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC, providing novel insights into the microbiota–tumour immunity crosstalk.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM’s persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their “accomplices,” undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Colon cancer (CC) remains a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, driven by difficulties in early diagnosis and constrained therapeutic options. Recent studies underscore the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in fostering malignancy progression and therapy resistance. Through their inherent plasticity, TAMs facilitate immunosuppression, angiogenic processes, metastatic spread, and drug tolerance. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which promote inflammatory and tumoricidal responses, M2 macrophages support tumor expansion and dissemination by exerting immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic influences. Consequently, manipulating TAMs has emerged as a potential avenue to enhance treatment effectiveness. This review outlines the origins, polarization states, and functions of TAMs in CC, highlights their role in driving tumor advancement, and surveys ongoing efforts to target these cells for better patient outcomes. Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating TAM functions - including depletion strategies, reprogramming approaches that shift M2-polarized TAMs toward an M1 phenotype, and inhibition of key signaling pathways sustaining TAM-mediated immunosuppression-are currently under active investigation. These approaches hold promise in overcoming TAM - induced resistance and improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in CC.">

The pathophysiology of IBD remains unclear, likely involving aberrant innate and adaptive immunity. Studies have reported altered population of MDSCs in patients with IBD. However, their distribution varies among patients and different preclinical models of IBD. The expansion and activation of MDSCs are likely driven by various stimuli during intestinal inflammation, but the in-depth mechanisms remain poorly understood. The role of MDSCs in the pathogenesis of IBD appears to be paradoxical. In addition to intestinal inflammation, suppressive MDSCs may promote colitis-to-colon cancer transition. In this Review, we summarize recent progresses on the features, activation, and roles of MDSCs in the development of IBD and IBD-associated colon cancer.">

        <tr id="Despite recent advancements, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a therapeutic challenge. While monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) leveraging natural killer (NK) cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity show great potential, none have gained clinical approval for AML. Immunocytokines have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the limited efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. IL-15 stimulates activation, proliferation cytotoxic activity of NK cells, but its clinical use is prevented by short half-life, poor accumulation in the tumor, and toxicity due to systemic off-target immune activation. Here we report on the generation and preclinical characterization of modified immunocytokines consisting of an Fc-optimized CLEC12A (CLL-1) antibody fused to an IL-15 moiety with E46K mutation. The mutation abrogates binding to IL-15Rα, thereby enabling substitution of physiological trans-presentation by target binding and thus conditional IL-15Rβ/γ stimulation to reduce systemic toxicity. An optimal CLEC12A binder was selected from a range of murine mAbs, based on analysis of AML cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. This antibody was then used to construct an immunocytokine (MIC12) that subsequently was characterized functionally. Analysis of NK cell activation, cytokine release, proliferation and anti-leukemia reactivity demonstrated that MIC12 induced superior target cell killing and NK cell expansion compared to Fc-optimized CLEC12A antibody, with efficacy being dependent on target antigen binding. Our results show that novel immunocytokines with conditional IL-15 activity are capable of inducing potent NK cell responses against AML cells and identify MIC12 as promising therapeutic candidate for leukemia treatment.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8+ T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8+ T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, our data suggests that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

While vaccine-induced TRM express high levels of CD103 and persist longer in the lung parenchyma, short-lived, H1N1-induced TRM have a transcriptome associated with higher cytotoxic potential and distinct transcriptional profile as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing. In both the vaccine and H1N1 groups, NP-specific CD8+ T cells expand during heterologous influenza virus infection and protect the mice from disease. Meanwhile, lung inflammation in response to an infection with unrelated respiratory syncytial virus do not influence the fate of pre-existing TRM. Our preclinical work thus confirms that inflammatory conditions in the tissue shape the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TRM to serve relevant informations for optimizing mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an exceedingly aggressive primary brain tumor defined by rapid growth, extensive infiltration, and resistance to standard therapies. A central factor driving these malignancies is the subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which possess self-renewal capacity, multipotency, and the ability to regenerate tumor heterogeneity. GSCs contribute to key hallmarks of GBM pathobiology, including relentless progression, resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and inevitable recurrence. GSCs exhibit distinct molecular signatures, enhanced DNA repair, and metabolic adaptations that protect them against conventional treatments. Moreover, they reside within specialized niches—such as perivascular or hypoxic microenvironments—that sustain stemness, promote immunosuppression, and facilitate angiogenesis. Recent discoveries highlight signaling pathways like Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, STAT3-PARN, and factors such as TFPI2 and HML-2 as critical regulators of GSC maintenance, plasticity, and immune evasion. These findings underscore the complexity of GSC biology and their pivotal role in driving GBM heterogeneity and therapeutic failure. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to target GSCs through multiple avenues, including surface markers, immunotherapeutics (e.g., CAR T cells), metabolic vulnerabilities, and combination regimens. Advances in patient-derived organoids, single-cell omics, and 3D co-culture models enable more accurate representation of the tumor ecosystem and personalized therapeutic approaches. Ultimately, improved understanding of GSC-specific targets and the tumor microenvironment promises more effective interventions, paving the way toward better clinical outcomes for GBM patients.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary In solid tumors, cancer cells are surrounded by nontumor cells, such as immune and stromal cells. Together with non-cellular components, they form the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer cells can hijack nontumor cells in the TME to support tumor growth. Therefore, the TME has a significant influence on the success of cancer therapy. In pancreatic cancer, immune cells of the innate immune system, macrophages, have been shown to negatively impact the survival rate of cancer patients. However, the mediators (chemokines) released by pancreatic cancer cells to control macrophages are understudied. In the present study, we characterized interactions between a murine macrophage cell line and two pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro. In screening 13 different chemokines, we observed a congruent increase in seven. This was paralleled by an increased expression of surface markers associated with a protumoral macrophage phenotype. Our findings are an essential basis for functional studies and might help to improve and develop novel therapies for pancreatic cancer in the future.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has become standard of care in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Changes in immunophenotypes observed at first diagnosis predict therapy outcome but little is known about the resolution of these alterations in remission. Comprehensive characterization of immune changes from fresh, peripheral whole blood revealed a functionally relevant increase of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, reduced naïve T-cells, and an increase of activated and terminally differentiated T-cells before treatment which aggravated after therapy. Suggesting causal relation, injection of lymphoma in mice induced similar changes in the murine T cells. Distinct immune imprints were found in breast cancer and AML survivors. Identified alterations persisted beyond five years of ongoing complete remission and in DLBCL correlated with increased pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-6, B2M, or sCD14. The chronic inflammation was associated with functionally blunted T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides and reduced responses correlated with reduced Tn-cells. Persisting inflammation was confirmed by deep sequencing and by cytokine profiles, together pointing towards a compensatory activation of innate immunity. The persisting, lymphoma-induced immune alterations in remission may explain long-term complications, have implications for vaccine strategies, and are likely relevant for immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated disorders are a broad range of diseases, arising as consequence of immune defects, exaggerated/misguided immune response or a mixture of both conditions. Their frequency is on a rise in the developed societies and they pose a significant challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Traditional pharmacological, monoclonal antibody-based or polyclonal antibody replacement-based therapies aiming at modulation of the immune responses give very often dissatisfactory results and/or are burdened with unacceptable adverse effects. In recent years, a new group of treatment modalities has emerged, utilizing cells as living drugs, especially with the use of the up-to-date genetic engineering. These modern cellular therapies are designed to offer a high potential for more targeted, safe, durable, and personalized treatment options. This work briefly reviews the latest advances in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, mainly those related to exaggeration of the immune response, with such cellular therapies as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and others. We highlight the main features of these therapies as new treatment options for taming the dysregulated immune system. Undoubtfully, in near future such therapies can provide lasting remissions in a range of immune-mediated disorders with reduced treatment burden and improved quality of life for the patients.">

        <tr id="The nexus between aging-associated immune deteriorations and tumorigenesis of lung cancers remains elusive. In a mouse model with Med23 depletion in T cells (Med23 -/-), it is found a strong association between the decline of CD103+ T cells and spontaneous alveolar epithelial type II cell (AT2 cell)-originated lung adenocarcinomas. The reduction of CD103+ T cells in the lung results in an accumulation of AT2 cells bearing oxidative damages, which appears to be the major origin of the lung adenocarcinoma. Functional experiments reveal CD103+ T cells can eradicate oxidative-damage-bearing AT2 cells as well as ROS-dependent, KRAS (G12D)-driven tumorigenesis. In vitro co-cultures prove CD103+ T cells, especially CD103+ CD8+ T cells, exhibit a killing capacity that matches the oxidative stress level in the target cells. In aged animals, it is found the abundance of CD103+ CD8+ T cells in the lung declines with age, accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative-damage-bearing AT2 cells. Collectively, the study establishes the vital function of CD103+ T cells in surveilling epithelial cells under oxidative stress to prevent malignancies, and unravels a potential immuno-dysregulation in the aged lung which contributes to tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) bridging CD3 on T‐cells to tumor‐associated antigens (TAA) on tumor cells can direct T‐cell immunity to solid tumors. “Bystander killing”, where T‐cell targeting of TAA‐positive tumor cells also leads to the eradication of TAA‐negative cells, may overcome TAA heterogeneity. While bystander activity of activated, engineered T‐cells has been shown to be robust and wide‐reaching, spatiotemporal aspects of bsAb‐mediated bystander activity are unresolved. Here, we developed a model where breast cancer tumoroids varying in HER2 expression were printed in to extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds. We generated (1) mixed tumors containing different ratios of HER2+ and HER2− tumor cells, and (2) HER2+ and HER2− tumoroids spaced at different distances within the ECM scaffold. Subsequently, tumors were exposed to peripheral blood‐derived T‐cells in the presence of CD3xHER2 bsAbs. We find that CD3xHER2 bsAb‐mediated interaction of resting, nonactivated T‐cells with HER2+ tumor cells is sufficient (1) to eliminate 50% HER2− cells in mixed tumor areas, and (2) to eradicate distant HER2− tumor areas. Such bystander killing involves paracrine IFNγ and TNFα activity but does not require T‐cell accumulation in HER2− areas. These findings indicate that bystander eradication of TAA‐negative cells can significantly contribute to bsAb therapy for solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis represents an emerging, iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. In recent years, it has garnered significant attention in the realm of cancer immunotherapy, particularly in studies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors. This form of cell death not only enhances our comprehension of the tumor microenvironment but is also considered a promising therapeutic strategy to address tumor resistance, investigate immune activation mechanisms, and facilitate the development of cancer vaccines. The combination of immunotherapy with ferroptosis provides innovative targets and fresh perspectives for advancing cancer treatment. Nevertheless, tumor cells appear to possess a wider array of ferroptosis evasion strategies compared to CD8+T cells, which have been conclusively shown to be more vulnerable to ferroptosis. Furthermore, ferroptosis in the TME can create a favorable environment for tumor survival and invasion. Under this premise, both inducing tumor cell ferroptosis and inhibiting T cell ferroptosis will impact antitumor immunity to some extent, and even make the final result run counter to our therapeutic purpose. This paper systematically elucidates the dual-edged sword role of ferroptosis in the antitumor process of T cells, briefly outlining the complexity of ferroptosis within the TME. It explores potential side effects associated with ferroptosis-inducing therapies and critically considers the combined application of ferroptosis-based therapies with ICIs. Furthermore, it highlights the current challenges faced by this combined therapeutic approach and points out future directions for development.">

Given the increasing application of ICIs in cancer therapy, ECP might offer a promising alternative to glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive treatments that may diminish therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy. 2 ECP is an immunomodulatory therapy initially developed for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

        <tr id="Background Major histocompatibility complex class I-related protein A and B (MICA/B) are ligands for the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor and are broadly expressed on tumor cells but minimally on normal tissues. When cytotoxic NKG2D-expressing immune cells engage MICA/B, the ligand-expressing cells are targeted for lysis. Cancer cells can evade NKG2D-mediated destruction by shedding MICA/B from their cell surface via proteases present in the tumor microenvironment. CLN-619 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds MICA/B and inhibits shedding resulting in accumulation of MICA/B on the tumor cell surface. CLN-619 may thereby have therapeutic effects in a broad range of malignancies by re-establishing the MICA/B-NKG2D axis to enable NKG2D-mediated, as well as Fc-gamma receptor-mediated, tumor cell lysis. Methods CLN-619 was characterized for binding epitope and affinity, effects on surface and soluble levels of MICA/B, and in vitro tumor cell killing. In mouse models, the mAb was tested for tumor growth inhibition. The contribution of the Fc-gamma (Fcγ) 1 domain to CLN-619 activity was also assessed. Results CLN-619 bound with high affinity to the alpha-3 domain of MICA/B without encumbering the interaction with NKG2D on natural killer cells. CLN-619 increased the level of cell surface expression of MICA/B and concomitantly decreased the levels of soluble MICA/B in cell culture assays. Treatment of cancer cell lines with CLN-619 induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. CLN-619 resulted in potent inhibition of tumor growth in multiple xenograft models and increased survival of mice in a disseminated cancer model. Conclusions CLN-619 inhibited the shedding of MICA/B to effectively restore cytotoxic signaling pathways in immune cells. Potent antitumor activity of CLN-619 as a monotherapy was observed in several preclinical models. Activity of CLN-619 required a functional Fcγ1 domain, suggesting the requirement of simultaneous engagement of NKG2D and cluster of differentiation 16A (CD16A) on immune cells for optimal cytotoxicity. The preclinical data reported here support the assessment of CLN-619 in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="TRIMELVax is an innovative immunotherapeutic vaccine for malignant melanoma, which combines heat shock-conditioned human melanoma cell lysates with a mollusk hemocyanin as an adjuvant. Preclinical studies demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in mice with melanoma and colorectal tumors. However, the precise immunological mechanisms behind its anti-tumor effects have remained unclear. We focused on understanding how TRIMELVax induces inflammation at the injection site, recruits innate immune cells, triggers DC migration to draining lymph nodes, and affects tumor microenvironment and growth. To achieve this, C57BL/6 mice were injected in the footpad with TRIMELVax, PBS, or control vaccines, and then the skin and the popliteal lymph node were harvested for qPCR or FACS analysis. Results showed that TRIMELVax rapidly induced a specific pattern of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a differential acute innate immune response in the injection site. Neutrophils, type 1 macrophages, monocytes, cDC1, Langerhans cells, and monocyte derived-DCs were recruited to the footpad, while type 2 macrophages decreased. This early inflammation facilitated a superior migration of cDC1 and a new subtype of antigen-presenting neutrophils to the draining lymph node compared to controls. Depleting neutrophils before vaccination reduced DC migration, especially cDC1, to the draining lymph node and suppressed TRIMELVax's ability to control tumor growth, demonstrating that vaccine-induced neutrophils play a fundamental role in TRIMELVax's mechanism of action. At the tumor microenvironment level, it was observed that TRIMELVax induces a more intense infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes than controls, with a low level of exhaustiveness and greater cytotoxic capacity. A phase I clinical trial in twenty nivolumab-refractory patients showed that TRIMELVax is well tolerated with no grade 3-5 side effects and induces a Delayed-Type hypersensitivity reaction against melanoma antigens after four doses of the vaccine with an impact on disease stability and patient survival. In summary, TRIMELVax triggers a rapid and potent activation of the innate immune system, which seems crucial for a more effective adaptive immune response against aggressive melanoma tumors. These results underscore the promise of TRIMELVax as a potential immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.">

        <tr id="Hematological malignancies are a diverse group of cancers that originate in the blood and bone marrow and are characterized by the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Myeloid blasts, which are derived from normal myeloid progenitors, play a central role in these diseases by disrupting hematopoiesis and driving disease progression. In addition, other myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, adapt dynamically to the tumor microenvironment, where they can promote immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review explores the unique characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of myeloid blasts, the immunosuppressive roles of myeloid cells, and their complex interactions within the TME. Furthermore, we highlight emerging therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, focusing on strategies to reprogram their functions, inhibit their suppressive effects, or eliminate pathological populations altogether, as well as the latest preclinical and clinical trials advancing these approaches. By integrating insights from these studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of myeloid cells in hematological malignancies and their potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="The molecular barriers that cause acute xenograft rejection have been identified and addressed by generating genetically modified (GM) animals, knocked out for specific xenoantigens (xenoAgs), and expressing regulatory molecules for both complement and coagulation pathways among others. The focus of xenotransplantation research now lies in delayed xenograft rejection. Dendritic cells (DC) are a specific subpopulation of professional antigen‐presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in the context of organ transplantation. DCs, originating from both the xenograft and the recipient, have the capacity to present xenoAgs to the recipient's immune system via their respective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to rejection. These processes are known as direct and indirect presentation, respectively. However, under certain microenvironmental conditions, DC develops into anti‐inflammatory regulatory cells that can induce immunological tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the general characteristics and functions of DC from species relevant to xenotransplantation, specifically humans, non‐human primates (NHP), and pigs. It will also cover the process of xenoAg presentation, different methods for generating DC with regulatory properties in vitro, and finally, discuss the current strategies for using regulatory DC to improve xenograft acceptance by inducing tolerance.">

These checkpoints play a key role in maintaining cardiac homeostasis by preventing immune-mediated damage to critical organs like the heart. In this study, we explored the involvement of PD-1 and CTLA-4 in cardiovascular complications, particularly atherosclerosis and myocarditis, which can lead to heart failure. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using animal models and clinical data to assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibition on cardiac function. Our findings indicate that disruption of PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways exacerbates myocardial inflammation, accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation, and promotes the development of heart failure. Additionally, we observed that immune checkpoint inhibition in these models led to increased infiltration of T lymphocytes, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced tissue damage. These results suggest that PD-1 and CTLA-4 are critical in preserving cardiac health, and their inhibition can result in severe cardiovascular toxicity. Our study emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of cardiovascular health in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) mediates durable and complete regression of various cancers. However, its efficacy is limited by the long-term persistence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, given their irreversible dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we aimed to establish an artificial lung metastasis model to examine T-lymphocyte subsets, in order to identify potential effective cell subsets for ACT.


METHODS
A metastatic lung melanoma mouse model was established using OVA-expressing melanoma B16 cells. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to examine the surface markers, transcription factors, and secreted cytokines of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells within metastatic tissues. The infiltrated cells were sorted by flow cytometry for in vitro tumor cell killing assays or in vivo cell infusion therapy combined with chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint blockade antibodies.


RESULTS
Exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex) exhibited high heterogeneity in metastatic tissues. Among Tex cells, the CXCR6- precursor cell showed certain memory characteristics, including phenotype, transcription factors, and maintenance, whereas the CXCR6+ subpopulation partially lost these traits. Moreover, CXCR6+ precursor cells effectively replenished effector-like Tex cells in metastatic tissues and exerted direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Notably, transferring these tumor-specific CXCR6+ precursor-exhausted T (Texp) cells into recipients induced a substantial regression of metastasis. In addition, these cells could respond to immune checkpoint blockade, which could better control tumor metastasis.


CONCLUSIONS
In our study, a subset of antigen-specific CXCR6-expressing Texp cells was observed within the metastatic tissue. The cells served as a crucial source of effector-like Tex cells and exerted direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Adoptive transfer of CXCR6+ Texp cells effectively mitigated lung metastasis in mice. This study helps elucidate the role of Texp cells in metastasis, thereby offering novel insights into enhancing the efficacy and durability of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Little is known about the regulation of B cell subpopulations in association with programmed cell death during dengue virus (DENV) infection. Therefore, blood samples from dengue-infected patients and healthy donors were obtained for B cell subset characterization and the analysis of pro-apoptotic CD95 expression in these cell subsets. The results showed that the activated memory (AM) subset in the patients remained unchanged compared to the healthy donors. In contrast, tissue memory (TM) and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were notably increased, whereas naïve cells and resting memory (RM) cells were considerably decreased. Although the ASCs maintained comparably high levels of CD95 expression in both groups, significantly increased percentages of CD95-expressing cells in the other B cell subsets were found in the patients. When B cells from the healthy donors were treated with DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), the results showed that the NS1 protein at 2 µg/mL could induce CD95 expression and the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane in most B cell subsets, except for the RM. This study demonstrates that DENV infection could induce CD95 expression in both activated and resting B cell subsets in all patients. The results also suggest a potential mechanism of apoptotic regulation in B cell subsets through the increased CD95 expression caused by the interaction between the B cells and the NS1 protein.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident immune cells such as innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are known to reside in the parenchymal compartments of tissues and modulate local immune protection. Here we use intravascular cell labeling, parabiosis and multiplex 3D imaging to identify a population of group 3 ILCs in mice that are present within the intravascular space of lung blood vessels (vILC3). vILC3s are distributed broadly in alveolar capillary beds from which inhaled pathogens enter the lung parenchyma. By contrast, conventional ILC3s in tissue parenchyma are enriched in lymphoid clusters in proximity to large veins. In a mouse model of pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection results in rapid vILC3 expansion and production of chemokines including CCL4. Blocking CCL4 in vivo attenuates neutrophil recruitment to the lung at the early stage of infection, resulting in prolonged inflammation and delayed bacterial clearance. Our findings thus define the intravascular space as a site of ILC residence in mice, and reveal a unique immune cell population that interfaces with tissue alarmins and the circulating immune system for timely host defense.">

        <tr id="Glatiramer acetate (GA) is the first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and is increasingly demonstrating promising therapeutic benefits in a range of other conditions. Despite its extensive use, the precise pharmacological mechanism of GA remains unclear. In addition to T and B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play significant roles in the neuroinflammation associated with MS, positioning them as potential initial targets for GA. Here, we investigated GA’s influence on the differentiation of human monocytes from healthy donors into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and assessed their activation status. Our results indicate that GA treatment does not hinder the differentiation of monocytes into moDCs or macrophages. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the expression of molecules required for antigen recognition, presentation, and co-stimulation in GA-treated moDCs. Conversely, there was a significant downregulation of CD1a, which is crucial for activating auto-aggressive T cells that respond to the lipid components of myelin. Furthermore, GA treatment resulted in an increased expression of CD68 on both CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD16− monocyte subsets. These in vitro findings suggest that GA treatment does not impede the generation of moDCs under inflammatory conditions; however, it may modify their functional characteristics in potentially beneficial ways. This provides a basis for future clinical studies in MS patients to elucidate its precise mode of action.">

        <tr id="This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts—such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia—is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules—such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT—are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression—through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation—the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.

        <tr id="Background Antigen-specific immunotherapy shows potential for inducing long-term immune tolerance in type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet its clinical application is hampered by uncertainty regarding dominant epitopes. Conversely, non-antigen-specific treatments such as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) present a more straightforward approach but struggle to maintain tolerance after treatment. Addressing these issues is critical for advancing T1D therapies. Methods The phenotypic and metabolic properties of two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells were analyzed in both humans and NOD mice. T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity and Bulk RNA sequencing provided insights into the transcriptomic profiles and TCR reactivity of these cells. Mechanistic studies were conducted using the HEK-293 T cell line and primary cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to evaluate the characteristics of different CD8+ T cell subsets following two types of immunotherapies. In NY8.3 mice, the effect of mitochondrial fission inhibitors on immunotherapy results was evaluated. Final validation was carried out with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1D patients. Results Our study reveals the diversity of two distinct exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets in T1D through flow cytometry, highlighting unique clinical features, phenotypes, and functions. Notable differences in TCR reactivity and metabolic pathways between these subsets were identified through TCR sequencing and transcriptomic analyses in NOD mice. Both antigen-specific and non-antigen-specific stimuli produced unique exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets. Our research identified leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) as a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, influencing the interconversion of exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets by phosphorylating dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at serine 637 (Ser637) and serine 616 (Ser616). scRNA-seq confirmed that antigen-specific immunotherapy effectively suppresses T cell signaling, induces exhaustion, and promotes the development of terminally exhausted T (TEX) cells. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti-CD3 mAb treatment by promoting the development of more TEX cells. Conclusions Our results point to a new immunotherapeutic approach that targets exhausted CD8+ T cells’ energy metabolism, offering valuable insights for advancing clinical strategies in T1D therapy.

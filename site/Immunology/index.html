        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The gut microbiota crucially regulates the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear at the single-cell resolution. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent validations, we investigate gut microbiota-ICI synergy by profiling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and elucidating critical cellular interactions in mouse models. Our findings reveal that intact gut microbiota combined with ICIs may synergistically increase the proportions of CD8+, CD4+, and γδ T cells, reduce glycolysis metabolism, and reverse exhausted CD8+ T cells into memory/effector CD8+ T cells, enhancing antitumor response. This synergistic effect also induces macrophage reprogramming from M2 protumor Spp1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to Cd74+ TAMs, which act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These macrophage subtypes show a negative correlation within tumors, particularly during fecal microbiota transplantation. Depleting Spp1+ TAMs in Spp1 conditional knockout mice boosts ICI efficacy and T cell infiltration, regardless of gut microbiota status, suggesting a potential upstream role of the gut microbiota and highlighting the crucial negative impact of Spp1+ TAMs during macrophage reprogramming on immunotherapy outcomes. Mechanistically, we propose a γδ T cell-APC-CD8+ T cell axis, where gut microbiota and ICIs enhance Cd40lg expression on γδ T cells, activating Cd40 overexpressing APCs (e.g., Cd74+ TAMs) through CD40-CD40L-related NF-κB signaling and boosting CD8+ T cell responses via CD86-CD28 interactions. These findings highlight the potential importance of γδ T cells and SPP1-related macrophage reprogramming in activating CD8+ T cells, as well as the synergistic effect of gut microbiota and ICIs in immunotherapy through modulating the TME.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive, human-specific commensal infectious pathogen, poses a significant global health threat, especially in children under five, often resulting in fatalities. The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) remain elusive, necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single-cell resolution. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals. We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset, with significant relative increases in platelets, neutrophils, and their precursors, alongside relative decreases in natural killer (NK) cells, T cell subtypes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up-regulation of neutrophils-related immune genes across multiple immune cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells and B cells, suggesting excessive neutrophil activation. However, a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients. This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxity were down-regulated in both NK cells and T cells, alongside impaired T cell activation. Notably, distinct B cell subtypes, including unique naïve B cell clusters, demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM. The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.">

        <tr id="The gastric mucosa is characterized by continuous innate immune surveillance and inflammatory signaling, yet a high proportion of gastric carcinomas (GCs) are recalcitrant to immune-directed therapies. The mechanisms by which GCs evade adaptive immune surveillance within the highly antigenic microenvironment of the gastric mucosa remains unknown. To address this, we collected patient-matched tumor tissue, distant normal tissue, metastasis, and draining lymph nodes to generate a large-scale single-cell immune profiling dataset from 64 patients (n=179 samples, >150,000 cells). From single cell analysis, we identified two distinct sources of impaired tumor surveillance within tumor draining lymph nodes. First, we observed that a significant fraction of tumor draining lymph nodes had undergone cytokine-driven reprogramming, leading to reduced dendritic cell homing and limited T cell priming. Second, T cells undergoing successful activation exhibited limited expansion and constrained differentiation, marked by expression of the quiescence-associated transcription factor Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2). Overexpression of KLF2 in primary T cells limited both their differentiation and cytotoxic capacity. These findings implicate both impaired T cell priming and KLF2-dependent T cell quiescence in limiting T cell immunity in gastric adenocarcinoma. We suggest these findings represent an emerging model for immune silencing in tumors developing from tissues with chronic inflammation.">

        <tr id="Antigen specificity is the central trait distinguishing adaptive from innate immune function. Assembly of antigen-specific T cell and B cell receptors occurs through V(D)J recombination mediated by the Recombinase Activating Gene endonucleases RAG1 and RAG2 (collectively called RAG). In the absence of RAG, mature T and B cells do not develop and thus RAG is critically associated with adaptive immune function. In addition to adaptive T helper 2 (Th2) cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) contribute to type 2 immune responses by producing cytokines like Interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13. Although it has been reported that RAG expression modulates the function of innate natural killer (NK) cells, whether other innate immune cells such as ILC2s are affected by RAG remains unclear. We find that in RAG-deficient mice, ILC2 populations expand and produce increased IL-5 and IL-13 at steady state and contribute to increased inflammation in atopic dermatitis (AD)-like disease. Furthermore, we show that RAG modulates ILC2 function in a cell-intrinsic manner independent of the absence or presence of adaptive T and B lymphocytes. Lastly, employing multiomic single cell analyses of RAG1 lineage-traced cells, we identify key transcriptional and epigenomic ILC2 functional programs that are suppressed by a history of RAG expression. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role for RAG in modulating innate type 2 immunity through suppression of ILC2s.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and heavily influence GBM biology, contributing to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, immune evasion, and neovascularization. Current in vitro models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a more physiologically relevant alternative to traditional models, offering a useful model for studying tumor-immune interaction in vitro.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs) are an abundant, phenotypically plastic cell population that is critical for initiating a robust antitumor response. To properly combat cancer cells, TAMCs must sense and transduce both soluble and vital biophysical cues imparted by the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite ample research enumerating the deleterious effects of a primary tumor’s ECM on TAMCs’ functionality, few studies have evaluated the contribution of mechanosensitive cation channel(s) underlying these detrimental changes. Methods Our study aimed to evaluate the significance of the mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1 in TAMCs’ phenotype and effector functionality. To do so, we generated CD11b-conditional Piezo1 knockout mice, orthotopically inoculated them with rhabdomyosarcoma 76–9, an aggressive syngeneic rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, and evaluated tumor burden, pan-immune compartment changes, and intrinsic myeloid and lymphoid transcriptomic and functional changes. Results Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in CD11b-expressing cells significantly hindered primary and metastatic tumor burden. Intratumorally, we observe enhanced infiltration of CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells. This phenotype was driven by CD11b+ DCs that have undergone transcriptional changes related to improved antigen presentation and T cell activation. Despite being canonically inefficient cross-presenters in the wildtype state, Piezo1 KO CD11b+ DCs, specifically the cDC2A subpopulation, efficiently cross-prime CD8+ T cells on exposure to exogenous particulate antigens. Conclusions Here, we report for the first time an association between mechanosensation and cross-presentation by cDC2A cells. Our findings may be impactful to improving the continued development of DC vaccines whose success hinges on proper antigen processing and presentation to cytotoxic T cells in the TME.">

        <tr id="Background Circulating immune cells play a crucial role in the anti-tumour immune response, yet the systemic immune system in metastatic breast cancers is not fully characterised. Investigating the cellular and molecular changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from breast cancer patients could elucidate the role of circulating immune cells in metastasis and aid in identifying biomarkers for disease burden and progression. Methods In this study, we characterised the systemic immune landscape associated with varying levels of metastatic burden by analysing the single-cell transcriptomes of PBMCs from breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Our research focused on identifying changes in immune cell composition, transcriptional programs, and immune-cell communication networks linked to metastatic burden. Additionally, we compared these PBMC features onto a single-cell atlas of primary breast tumours to study corresponding traits in tumour-infiltrating immune cells. Results In metastatic breast cancer, PBMCs exhibit a significant downregulation of the adaptive immune system and a decreased number and activity of unconventional T cells, such as γδ T cells. Additionally, metastatic burden is associated with impaired cell communication pathways involved in immunomodulatory functions. We also identified a gene signature derived from myeloid cells shared between tumour immune infiltrates and circulating immune cells in breast cancer patients. Conclusions Our study provides a comprehensive single-cell molecular profile of the peripheral immune system in breast cancer, offering a valuable resource for understanding metastatic disease in terms of tumour burden. By identifying immune traits linked to metastasis, we have unveiled potential new biomarkers of metastatic disease.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="The current concept is that the eye is an immune privileged site endowed with innate immune regulatory networks to maintain organ function. We now have evidence that resident T cells occupy intraocular tissues. In immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, tissue resident T cells trigger disease flares in the skin and joints. This suggests resident T cells in the uvea may have similar functions in non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis, a collective term for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the uveal tract causing intraocular inflammation. Here, we demonstrate by spectral cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging that non-inflamed uveal tissue contains multiple T cell subtypes including CD8+ CD103+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. Using single cell RNA & T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile aqueous humour cells from donors with acute, active uveitis, we identify clonally expanded T cells which are enriched for TRM -associated genes. We further show that in donors with active uveitis, CD8+ CD103+ T cells persist within tissue in the uveal tract. Using bulk RNA sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) we show that quiescent iris tissue from donors with a history of uveitis are enriched for genes associated with T cell activation and antigen presentation. Finally, we demonstrate that TRM cells persist in the anterior uvea in mice following resolution of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Our results show that the human eye contains T cells both in health and during active inflammation. Our findings challenge the dogma that the eye is devoid of lymphocytes and supports the concept of resident T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis and as promising targets for therapy. One Sentence Summary T cells infiltrate aqueous humour during intraocular inflammation and have capacity to migrate into uveal tissue where they remain long-lived.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as key immune components of the TME, play a pivotal role in tumor progression by fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Programmed death 1 (PD-1), a critical immune checkpoint molecule predominantly expressed on T cells, mediates immune suppression by binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Emerging evidence reveals that TAMs also express PD-1, however, the expression and functional regulatory mechanisms of PD-1 on TAM remain poorly understood. Methods In this study, we combined bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to investigate the association between PD-1 expression on macrophages and patient prognosis, while also uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which PD-1 regulates macrophage function. To further investigate the role of PD-1 in macrophage activity, we established a fluorescence-labeled tumor-bearing mouse model using CT26 cells, a murine colorectal cancer cell line, to evaluate the relationship between PD-1 expression on TAMs and their phagocytic activity as well as other functions. Additionally, to mimic the TME in vitro, we cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with CT26-conditioned medium (CT26-CM). Results Our results suggest that PD-1 expression on TAMs drives macrophage polarization toward an M2-like phenotype, suppresses their phagocytic activity, inhibits the synthesis of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling molecules, and ultimately promotes tumor progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PD-1 regulates the synthesis of IFN-γ signaling molecules and the polarization of M2-type macrophages in BMDMs through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Overall, our study demonstrates that PD-1 expression on TAMs facilitates the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, ultimately accelerating tumor progression.

        <tr id="Background T-cell exhaustion is a major barrier to effective antitumor immunity and limits the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. This study investigates the role of suppressor of T-cell signaling 2 (STS2, also known as UBASH3A) in regulating CD8+ T-cell exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment. Methods We used genetic ablation of STS2 in mouse models to assess tumor control and responses to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade therapy. CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were characterized through flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell transcriptomics. Mechanistic studies included co-immunoprecipitation, protein degradation assays, and endocytosis measurements to elucidate the interplay between STS2 and PD-1. Results STS2 expression progressively increased with T-cell exhaustion. Genetic deletion of STS2 enhanced tumor control and improved responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. STS2-deficient CD8+ TILs maintained a more functional state, exhibiting enhanced effector activity, proliferation, and antitumor efficacy while resisting terminal exhaustion. Mechanistically, we discovered that STS2 physically interacts with PD-1 and modulates its expression, endocytosis, and degradation at the protein level. Conclusions Our findings establish STS2 as a multifaceted regulator of T-cell exhaustion and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for enhancing antitumor immunity and improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a lethal manifestation of acute lung injury, remains a critical public health concern due to the absence of targeted therapies. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for immunopathology during DAD progression are largely undefined. Here, by integrating single cell RNA sequencing, functional assays, and genetic/pharmacological interventions in a mouse model of ricin-induced DAD, we revealed a significant accumulation of neutrophil with an activated phenotype that plays a critical role in immunopathology. We observed the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during DAD, which further intensified inflammation and tissue injury. IL-17A signaling activity was upregulated in DAD-affected lungs, while IL-17A deficiency or functional blockade significantly attenuated neutrophil recruitment, NET generation, and tissue damage. Mechanically, IL-17A stimulates lung resident fibroblasts to produce the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1. Notably, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) emerged as the dominant source of IL-17A, highlighting a triad of interactions among ILC3, fibroblast, and neutrophil in DAD pathogenesis. This finding delineates a pathogenic IL-17A-neutrophil-NET axis that amplifies lung immunopathology after ricin-induced DAD, a deeper understanding of these relationships may pave the way for mitigate DAD immunopathology and other lung inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Background T cells play a central role in host protection against respiratory pathogens, but a maladaptive T cell response can lead to pulmonary diseases. Defining the biology of protective versus pathogenic T cell responses in the lungs of humans will be critical to nominate novel approaches to improve respiratory health. Previous studies have examined T cells from the lungs captured via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial brushings, or biopsies. However, whether these different approaches are capturing distinct T cell phenotypes and/or clonotypes remains unclear. Objective To evaluate and compare the transcriptional signatures of T cells isolated via BAL versus endobronchial brushings in healthy controls (HCs) and allergic asthmatics (AAs). Methods Flexible bronchoscopy was performed to obtain BAL and endobronchial brushings from 3 HC and 3 AA subjects. CD3+ T cells were sorted and single cell RNA- and T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing was performed using the 10X Chromium platform. Unbiased clustering, differential gene expression analysis and TCR repertoire analysis was performed. Results Unbiased clustering analysis allowed us to define 7 CD8 and 6 CD4 T cell subsets. The most significant difference in T cell subsets abundance between AAs and HCs was the enrichment of CD4 T helper type 2 (Th2) cells when comparing endobronchial brush samples (OR=26.2, P=0.002), but not when examining BAL (OR=1.7, P=0.46), indicating differences in the T cell subsets captured from the BAL versus airway mucosa specimen processing. In further support of this observation, comparing the BAL and brush T cells across all subjects revealed an up-regulation of resident-memory T cell markers (i.e. ITGAE, CD69) in brush T cells versus BAL T cells in both CD4 and CD8 lineages. In contrast, BAL CD8 and CD4 T cells exhibited an enriched type I and II interferon signatures compared to brush T cells. Lastly, TCR repertoire analysis revealed that brush T cells contained dramatically expanded TCR clones. Expanded T cell clones from the brush expressed high levels of resident-memory markers, suggesting the airway mucosa is enriched for TRM cells with unique TCR specificity. Conclusions Sampling T cells via BAL versus airway brushings yielded distinct T cell phenotypes and clonotypes with important implications for future research in lung immunology.">

        <tr id="Various inhibitors targeting T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing molecule 3 (TIM3) aimed at reversing T-cell exhaustion for better immunotherapy outcomes have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy as monotherapy, with the underlying mechanisms remaining ambiguous. TIM3 is markedly expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), and the inconsistent research findings on its role in myeloid cells underscore its vital function within DCs. Through the establishment of an in vitro differentiation model generating mature dendritic cells (mDCs) under TIM3-targeted interventions, combined with an RNA sequencing analysis, this investigation systematically examined TIM3-mediated regulation and ligand interactions in human primary DCs. The findings indicate that TIM3 inhibition hinders DC maturation, which subsequently diminishes the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, ultimately leading to immune suppression in T cells. These findings collectively establish TIM3 as a regulator of DC differentiation that promotes DC maturation while optimizing the antigen-processing and presentation capacity. This study elucidates the rationale behind the suboptimal efficacy of TIM3 inhibitors and advocates for retaining TIM3 signaling pathways in DCs.">

        <tr id="Eosinophils are agile cells that participate in a multitude of homeostatic and inflammatory responses in the lung, ranging from allergic asthma to antiviral defense against respiratory viral infection. In the context of vaccination followed by viral infection, such as breakthrough infection, eosinophils have been linked to aberrant Th2 responses like vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). Here, we demonstrate that the lung immune cell composition, cytokine and chemokine repertoire, histopathological profile, and systemic humoral response of breakthrough influenza infection in mice is distinct from that of primary influenza infection or allergic sensitization, canonical Type 1 and 2 immune responses, respectively. Longitudinal comparison of breakthrough infection with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection demonstrated major differences in lung immunity between treatment groups in female, BALB/c mice. Breakthrough infection mice exhibit lung eosinophil infiltration that peaks at 7-10 days post-challenge, enriched for the Siglec-Fhi subset, but in the absence of overt pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine signals, high viral titers, severe lung lesions, goblet cell hyperplasia, allergic levels of total IgE, or enhanced morbidity. Multiparameter fluorescence imaging corroborated findings from flow cytometry and also unveiled interactions between CD101+Siglec-F+ cells with CD3+ cells in the lung tissue space. Imaging also revealed a marked absence of eosinophil or neutrophil extracellular traps in the lungs of breakthrough infection mice, in contrast with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection, respectively. Altogether, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the kinetics and cell-cell interplay during non-pathological, balanced Type 1/2 immune responses in vaccinated hosts during breakthrough infection.">

        <tr id="Axl, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family comprised of Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK, is a promising cancer therapeutic target actively under clinical investigation. Axl is understood to be a dual target in cancer to (1) prevent tumor cell growth and invasion and (2) potentiate anti-tumor immunity. This immunity is characterized by myeloid cell activation and downstream recruitment and activation of anti-tumor T cells. However, the ways by which Axl inhibition promotes myeloid cell activation in the tumor microenvironment are incompletely understood. There is thus a need to understand the effects of Axl inhibition on myeloid cells in the context of the broader tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed a human in vitro model system using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and Axl-expressing melanoma tumor cells to elucidate the effects of Axl inhibition on the myeloid compartment of the tumor microenvironment. We found that treatment with the Axl-specific small molecule inhibitor bemcentinib yields increased expression of markers of activation in both macrophages and dendritic cells. Interestingly, the addition of dendritic cells to the system appears to dampen macrophage response, suggesting that these cells cooperate to share the burden of the innate immune response. Most importantly, we found that treatment-naïve tumor cells and targeted therapy-treated tumor cells have distinct impacts on macrophage state, and these differences dictate the nature of the immune cell response to Axl inhibition. As a whole, our work highlights the utility of in vitro models in unraveling the complex mechanistic effects of Axl inhibition and establishes a robust model system that can be used in future mechanistic drug studies with the potential to inform clinical trial design.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) pathology involves complex immune responses within granulomatous lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cellular compositions of necrotizing granulomatous lesions that developed in the lungs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We identified 11 distinct major cell types, including phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, and T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among T cells, particularly, Pdcd1⁺ γδ T cells were detected in necrotizing granulomatous lesions, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Within the macrophage populations, we identified a cluster with significantly higher Plin2 expression compared to other clusters, whose transcriptomic profile was consistent with that of foamy macrophages. A subset of the Plin2-expressing macrophages was identified as a major source of Ifnb1 and Cxcl1, suggesting their involvement in type I interferon signaling and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, we identified Flrt2, Hyal1, and Mmp13 as novel molecular markers of Plin2-expressing macrophages, which were localized to the peripheral rim regions of necrotizing granulomas. In conclusion, our results provide the immune landscape of necrotizing granulomas and reveal novel functional states of macrophages contributing to TB pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Elucidating the anti-tumor role of tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs) in patients could offer critical mechanistic insight and shift therapeutic strategies from a tumor-centric approach to one that considers tumor-immune system interplay. Our study characterizes benign tdLNs T cell anti-tumor responses beyond initial T cell priming in patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. We further investigated whether tumor-specific tdLN T cells were altered by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) locally and systemically. We performed single-cell TCR lineage tracing and transcriptomic profiling on 672,886 CD8 T cells from 41 tumor, benign tdLN, and blood samples in 14 patients treated with or without neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (ChemoIO). Using deep-integrating clonal tracking with machine learning-based transcriptional analysis, our findings revealed that benign tdLNs locally and independently orchestrate two transcriptionally distinct tumor-specific memory CD8 T cell populations: one with ZNF683+ CXCR6+ tumor tissue-residency potential, and another with cytotoxic memory potential. Furthermore, tdLN-derived clones not only constitute the dominant tumor-infiltrating (75%) and circulating (>90%) tumor-specific expanded T cell populations but also preserve their transcriptionally distinct subset identities within the tumor T cell effector state. ChemoIO selectively increased the clonal diversity and cytotoxic memory/TEMRA programs of tdLN-derived clones locally and systemically, both of which remained unchanged in clones lacking tdLN TCR lineage. In conclusion, the tdLN locally orchestrates tumor-reactive and ChemoIO-reactive transcriptional distinct T cell subsets that shape the circulating blood and tumor T cell environments. These findings represent a clinical paradigm shift with implications regarding the extent of tdLN resection during surgery, timing of ChemoIO treatment, and the development of memory T cell-based immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and, despite treatment advances, immune suppression remains an obstacle to effective therapy. Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.">

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade therapy has generated dramatic responses in certain cancer types, breast tumors are largely unresponsive. Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity leads to the assembly of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and drives resistance of breast tumors to immunotherapies. Importantly, targeting CD73 completely sensitizes quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. However, the mechanism(s) of sensitization remained unknown. We demonstrate that targeting CD73 in quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors sensitizes them to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in a CD4+ T-cell dependent manner. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity results in elevated expression of cancer cell-intrinsic CD73 in human triple negative breast cancers. Given the ability of quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to metastasize and resist multiple therapies, these findings can instruct the formation of novel translational strategies for the treatment of human breast cancers. These findings also bring to the forefront the attractive possibility of utilizing the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells along with CD73 and CD4+ T-cells as a predictive criterion for immunotherapy responsiveness.

        <tr id="Prior infection elicits durable reprogramming in myeloid cells and their progenitors; however, the long-term consequences of this reprogramming are not well understood. We previously established a murine model of sepsis survival induced by cecal ligation and puncture which results in enhanced lung injury responses to lipopolysaccharide. In this model, classical monocytes from post-sepsis mice display persistently enhanced cytokine expression after lipopolysaccharide. To test the hypothesis that inflammatory reprogramming of monocytes mediates enhanced lung injury in post-sepsis mice, depletion and/or adoptive transfer was performed three weeks and three months after sepsis. Transcriptomic and epigenomic pathways associated with monocyte reprogramming and shifts in novel monocyte subsets were determined after sepsis in mice and humans. Monocytes from post-sepsis mice mediated enhanced LPS-induced lung injury and promoted neutrophil degranulation. Prior sepsis enhanced JAK-STAT signaling and AP-1 binding in monocytes, shifting toward the neutrophil-like monocyte subset and their progenitors. Similar neutrophil-like monocyte shifts were observed in adult sepsis patients and monocyte counts were predictive of 90-day mortality. We conclude that sepsis induces inflammatory memory affecting bone marrow progenitors and monocyte subsets predisposing to lung injury. These observations serve as a foundation for future investigations on neutrophil-like monocytes and inflammatory program interaction in tissue injury responses. Summary Sepsis shifts the immune program and ontogeny of monocytes and their progenitors contributing to long-term risk for new organ injury.">

        <tr id="Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) share features and regulatory pathways with normal stem cells, yet how the stem cell niche contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify CXCR4+ macrophages as a niche population enriched in normal mammary ducts, where they promote the regenerative activity of basal cells in response to luminal cell-derived CXCL12. CXCL12 triggers AKT-mediated stabilization of β-catenin, which induces Wnt ligands and pro-migratory genes, enabling intraductal macrophage infiltration and supporting regenerative activity of basal cells. Notably, these same CXCR4+ niche macrophages regulate the tumor-initiating activity of various breast cancer subtypes by enhancing TIC survival and tumor-forming capacity, while promoting early immune evasion through regulatory T cell induction. Furthermore, a CXCR4+ niche macrophage gene signature correlates with poor prognosis in human breast cancer. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in orchestrating interactions between niche macrophages, mammary epithelial cells, and immune cells, thereby establishing a supportive niche for both normal tissue regeneration and mammary tumor initiation.">

        <tr id="Background This study aims to explore the common mechanisms between aging and the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A total of 87 patients with AS and matched controls were analyzed via multidimensional flow cytometry to examine the peripheral blood immune signature. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to characterize T-cell subsets. The infiltration of Ly49h + cells (the murine homolog of NKG2C) was observed in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, and functional experiments were conducted to validate the cytotoxicity of NKG2C + CD8 + T cells. The mechanisms were further confirmed via the use of HLA-B27 transgenic mice and RNA-sequencing. Results The peripheral blood immune signature of AS patients exhibited dysregulation similar to that observed during aging. NKG2C + CD8 + T cells activated the PI3K‒Akt signaling pathway and increased phagocytosis in AS patients. HLA-B27 stimulation significantly increased the cytotoxicity of this subset, an effect that could be reversed by NKG2C blockade. In HLA-B27 transgenic mice, Ly49h + T cells exhibited significantly enhanced degranulation ability. RNA sequencing validated the activation of the PI3K‒Akt pathway in NKG2C + CD8 + T cells by HLA-B27. Conclusions HLA-B27 drives the cytotoxicity of aging-related NKG2C + CD8 + T cells via activation of the PI3K‒Akt signaling pathway. Targeting NKG2C inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for AS. This study elucidates the association between immune aging and the pathogenesis of AS, providing theoretical evidence for clinical intervention.

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects various organs and systems, significantly impacting patients’ health and quality of life. Conventional drugs, including glucocorticoids and standard immunosuppressive drugs, may not be enough to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome in some refractory SLE patients. The abnormal phenotype and function of macrophages participate in the development of SLE. The targeted delivery to reprogram macrophage in SLE has been a long-standing challenge. Apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) are essential for intercellular communications. This study aims to explore an effective and targeted treatment to SLE via macrophage reprogramming and Treg differentiation. In this work, we found that M2 macrophages-derived ApoBDs (M2-ApoBDs) could selectively target and localize to the spleen, where they were engulfed by splenic macrophages (phagocytic rate 73.4%). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the efferocytosis of M2-ApoBDs triggered transcriptional changes in M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages within the spleen, subsequently promoting the differentiation of Treg cells in vivo. Immunological experiments revealed that M2-ApoBDs prompted the reprogramming of M2 macrophages in vitro, which subsequently influenced Treg cell differentiation via ligand-receptor interactions. In SLE mice, M2-ApoBDs alleviated the disease progression, including 24-hours urinary protein, plasma creatinine, plasma C3 levels, and glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. These findings show that M2-ApoBDs can targeted-modulate macrophage polarization and Treg immune regulation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for the effective treatment of SLE.

Their presence within the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with increased patient survival and an improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), positioning TLS as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Despite the widespread use of ICIs across various cancers, their effectiveness remains limited in gynecological malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC), a notably challenging disease characterized by poor responses to both single and combination ICI therapies.

        <tr id="Abstract Background and Aims Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Nonetheless, 40-60% of patients will not respond adequately. The mechanisms underlying responses to tofacitinib remain unknown. Methods We applied single-cell and/or bulk RNA analysis to biopsies (n = 23 and 63, respectively) from ulcerative colitis patients (n = 31) before and after tofacitinib treatment. Response was assessed using endoscopic and clinical criteria. In vitro-derived macrophages and primary intestinal fibroblasts were used to validate our findings. Results Forty percent of patients responded to tofacitinib. Responders exhibited higher baseline JAK-STAT activity, while non-responders had increased baseline NF-kB pathway activation. Response was associated with significant changes in the abundance and/or activation of immune, epithelial, and stromal cells and the downregulation of S100A9, FCGR3A, MMP12 in resident macrophages. In contrast, non-responders showed a significant increase in the number and activation of macrophages and fibroblasts following tofacitinib treatment, including upregulation of MMP9, IL1B, IL6, CXCL1, CXCL8, and S100A9 compared to baseline. In monocyte-derived macrophages tofacitinib drove the hyperactivation of macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide, but not TNF or IFNγ. This effect is dependent on the inhibition of IL-10 signaling, which is abundantly induced in response to LPS, but not to TNF or IFNγ. In contrast, cultured fibroblasts, which produced no IL-10 regardless of the stimuli, showed no hyperactivation when pre-treated with tofacitinib. Conclusions We conclude that resistance to tofacitinib is mediated by the hyperactivation of myeloid cells and we identify IL-10-dependent macrophages as one cellular subset contributing to this resistance.">

        <tr id="To date, murine sepsis models have failed to recapitulate human acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the leading complications of human sepsis. We set out to determine if preexisting T cell memory, which is common in human adults and lacking in laboratory mice, could contribute to lung inflammation in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. After administering an anti-CD3ε activating antibody to C57Bl/6 mice to induce a T cell memory repertoire, we compared the pulmonary immune response to CLP in these “Immune-Educated mice” to responses observed in Uneducated control animals. Compared to Uneducated mice, 24 hours after CLP, Immune-Educated mice had higher alveolar inflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations and more pulmonary interstitial macrophages. After 48 hours, the proportion of effector CD4 T cells that produced interferon-gamma was greater in Immune- Educated mice. After 72 hours, there were more alveolar macrophages in the lungs of Educated mice. Separately, we performed adoptive transfer of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells from immunized C57Bl/6J to B6.SJL mice and IFNγ blockade at the time of CLP. Interstitial macrophage recruitment 24 hours post-CLP was more pronounced in mice undergoing adoptive transfer of memory T cells compared to mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer. IFNγ blockade resulted in higher absolute numbers of T cells, memory T cells, and innate cells in the lungs of Educated mice 24 hours post-CLP suggesting that IFNγ is necessary for curbing an overactive immune response in these mice. In conclusion, the presence of memory T cells affects the course of CLP- induced lung inflammation and may provide a model that more closely resembles sepsis- associated lung injury. Summary Statement Prior immune memory alters the course of CLP-induced lung inflammation in mice.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have improved patient outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, most patients do not experience durable benefit. The non-T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment, characterized by limited CD8+ T-cell infiltration, reduced dendritic cell function, and low interferon-γ-associated gene expression, is associated with a lower likelihood of response to ICI. To nominate new therapeutic targets for overcoming ICI resistance in HCC, we conducted a large-scale multiomic analysis on 900+human specimens (RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), proteomics) and 31 tumor single-cell (sc) RNA-seq samples, with tissue validation through imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial lipidomics by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), with experimental investigation by in vitro CD8+ T-cell recruitment and macrophage polarization functional assays using three-dimensional (3D) co-culture models. We discovered 32 oncogenic pathways associated with immune exclusion, with sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1, encoded by SREBF1) as a hub regulator. scRNA-seq analysis showed that SREBP1 signaling is associated with enriched lipid biogenesis pathways in tumor cells, elevated immunosuppressive markers in macrophages, and diminished CD8+ T-cell infiltration. Integration of IMC and MALDI images revealed distinct lipid species differentially abundant in tumor regions with low versus high CD8+ T cell infiltration. Functional studies in a 3D in vitro tumor-immune co-culture system demonstrated that CRISPR-mediated SREBF1 knockout (KO) in HepG2 cells reduced monocyte recruitment, decreased expression of the protumorigenic CD206 marker in macrophages, and enhanced CD8+ T-cell migration compared with wild-type (WT) (p<0.0001). RNA-seq of SREBF1 KO versus WT tumor cells confirmed suppression of lipid biosynthesis genes. Our findings nominate an atlas of tumor-intrinsic drivers of immune exclusion, particularly SREBP1 via pro-tumorigenic macrophage (M2-like) reprogramming. These pathways may represent novel therapeutic targets to enhance antitumor immunity and deserve further study as targeted therapy candidates to enhance ICI in HCC.">

        <tr id="Human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by chronic skin pathology. Experimental and clinical data suggest that immune checkpoints (ICs) play a crucial role in disease outcome, but the cellular and molecular niches that facilitate IC molecule expression during leishmaniasis are ill defined. In Sri Lankan patients with CL, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and programmed death–ligand 1 (PD-L1) were enriched in skin lesions, and reduced PD-L1 expression early after treatment initiation was predictive of a cure rate following antimonial therapy. Here, we used spatial cell interaction mapping to identify IL-32–expressing CD8+ memory T cells and Tregs as key components of the IDO1/PD-L1 niche in Sri Lankan patients with CL and in patients with distinct forms of dermal leishmaniasis in Brazil and India. Furthermore, the abundance of IL-32+ cells and IL-32+CD8+ T cells at treatment initiation was negatively correlated with the rate of cure in Sri Lankan patients. This study provides insights into the spatial mechanisms underpinning IC expression during CL and offers a strategy for identifying additional biomarkers of treatment response.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Type I interferons (IFN-Is) have a complex role in HIV-1 infection, offering early protection but contributing to harm over time. In the acute phase, IFN-Is help control the virus, activate the innate immune system, and reduce the formation of long-term viral reservoirs. However, during chronic HIV-1 infection, continued IFN-I signaling can become harmful. It leads to ongoing inflammation, T cell exhaustion, and tissue damage. Prolonged IFN-I exposure also increases immune suppression by upregulating inhibitory receptors on T cells and disrupting their metabolism. New therapies are being developed to balance IFN-I’s benefits and drawbacks. These include blocking IFN-I receptors (IFNARs), enhancing autophagy, inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling, and combining immune checkpoint therapies. Such strategies aim to reduce immune dysfunction and improve T cell responses. Overall, understanding and adjusting IFN-I signaling could help manage chronic HIV-1 more effectively, minimizing harm while preserving its antiviral benefits.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown promising clinical efficacy in cancer treatment, but only a subset of patients experience significant therapeutic responses. Tumor cells respond to internal and external stresses, such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the tumor microenvironment. This response helps maintain homeostasis, promoting malignant progression, chemotherapy resistance, and immune escape. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with ICB revealed upregulation of thioredoxin (TXN) expression in the epithelial tissues of LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) and LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) patients with minimal pathological remission. High TXN expression was also associated with “cold tumors,” characterized by a lack of T cells and low levels of chemokine receptors and immunomodulators. Experimental results showed that TXN was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues, and its knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells. Furthermore, TXN knockdown enhanced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against these tumor cells, suggesting that TXN contributes to immune escape in NSCLC by promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting immune killing. Notably, TXN knockdown also upregulated CD40 expression, indicating that TXN may regulate immune escape in lung cancer through CD40 modulation.

        <tr id="Dysregulated metabolism of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment leads to immune evasion and tumor progression. As a major cell component in the tumor, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2hi TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (Tregs) to TH17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to immune suppression observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are hijacked during development and further reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment (TME) to harbor immune-suppressive properties and inhibit T-cell functions. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, including BRD4, are epigenetic modulators that regulate genes implicated in CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions. Previously, we investigated how the novel BET inhibitor OPN-51107 (OPN5) prevents CLL disease expansion, modulates T-cell immune function, and alters gene expression related to MDSCs. In turn, we hypothesize that BET proteins such as BRD4 regulate MDSC functions, and subsequent pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 will alleviate MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL. Methods: Utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, we evaluated BRD4 protein expression in MDSCs derived from the bone marrow of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. We then investigated the ex vivo functionality of OPN5-treated MDSCs, expanded from Eµ-TCL1 and WT bone marrow in MDSC-supportive medium. Finally, we conducted an in vivo study utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model to determine the in vivo effects of OPN5 on MDSCs and other immune populations. Results: Through the course of this study, we found that MDSCs isolated from Eμ-TCL1 mice upregulate BRD4 expression and are more immune-suppressive than their WT counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrated ex vivo OPN5 treatment reverses the immune-suppressive capacity of MDSCs isolated from leukemic mice, evident via enhanced T-cell proliferation and IFNγ production. Finally, we showed in vivo OPN5 treatment slows CLL disease progression and modulates immune cell populations, including MDSCs. Conclusions: Altogether, these data support BET inhibition as a useful therapeutic approach to reverse MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality globally, with brain metastasis (BM) in 40% of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. In 15% of these cases, the brain is the sole affected organ (oligometastasis), which correlates with a better prognosis compared to widespread disease. It remains unclear if brain-only metastasis without systemic spread is due to the immune system’s ability to control systemic tumor progression. We studied the immune cell compositions in NSCLC patients with BM, identifying novel patterns associated with BM, and specifcally with either oligo- or polymetastatic spread. Multi-parametric immune phenotyping of peripheral blood primarily showed alterations in the CD4+ T cell compartment, with increased CD4+ TH17 cells, and higher IL-17 levels in NSCLC BM patients compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells in BM patients exhibited lower CD73 expression and reduced effector memory differentiation. There was also decreased intratumoral infiltration and a distinct CD4+ T cell profile in oligo-synchronous BM, both in the tumor microenvironment and peripheral blood, compared to polymetastatic BM patients. Additionally, CD73 was significantly upregulated in CD4+ and T regulatory cells of oligo-synchronous (BM simulantously with primary-tumor diagnosis) BM. These findings suggest that CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in the biology of NSCLC BM and potentially contribute to differences in metastatic patterns, as oligo-synchronous BM shows a more significant alteration in the CD4+ T cell immune profile, both locally at the tumor site and systemically.

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

Using micromanipulator-assisted isolation of rare DCCs, single-cell mRNA and DNA sequencing, codetection by indexing immunofluorescence imaging and survival analysis, we identified melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP)+ melanoma cells as metastasis founder cells (MFCs). We found that DCCs entering SLNs predominantly exhibited a transitory phenotype that, upon interferon-γ exposure triggered by CD8 T cells, dedifferentiated into a neural-crest-like phenotype. This was accompanied by increased production of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) carrying the immunomodulatory proteins CD155 and CD276 but rarely programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1. The sEVs suppressed CD8 T cell proliferation and function, facilitating colony formation. Targeting MCSP+ MFCs or their immune escape mechanisms could be key to curing melanoma early by preventing manifestation of metastasis.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits profound molecular heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features that limit therapeutic efficacy. This review elucidates the dual roles of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC progression. TLS, ectopic lymphoid organs formed under chronic inflammation, correlate with improved survival and immunotherapy sensitivity by fostering effector T/B cell interactions and antigen presentation. Conversely, immunosuppressive TME components like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) drive immune evasion via cytokine-mediated suppression and checkpoint activation (PD-1/PD-L1). CD8+ T cells exert context-dependent effects, with high infiltration reducing recurrence risk but paradoxically inducing exhaustion in PD-L1-rich microenvironments. Th17 and memory T cells further modulate disease through IL-17-driven angiogenesis and CD45RO+ immune memory dynamics. Multi-omics-based TLS scoring and combinatorial therapies emerge as promising strategies to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="Background Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by recurrent episodes that significantly impair disease control and reduce patients’ quality of life. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying asthma relapse remain poorly understood, and effective strategies to prevent exacerbations are still lacking. Methods An acute allergic asthma relapse mouse model was established using ovalbumin sensitization and challenge. Single-cell transcriptomics was employed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving asthma relapse. Flow cytometry and gene knockout experiments were conducted to validate the findings. Results We successfully established an acute allergic asthma relapse mouse model. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that T cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are pivotal during asthma relapse, serving as the primary cellular sources of type 2 inflammatory cytokines. Further subcluster analysis identified T-cell subcluster 4 and ILC2 subcluster 0 as the predominant contributors to type 2 cytokine production. Complex intercellular communication networks were observed, with macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells functioning as central signaling hubs. Pseudo-time trajectory analysis highlighted the critical role of ILC2s and the Il1rl1 signaling pathway in asthma relapse. These findings were corroborated by flow cytometry. Il1rl1-deficient mice displayed similar pulmonary inflammation to wild-type mice during the initial asthma episode; however, asthma relapse was significantly attenuated. Mechanistically, Il1rl1 deficiency resulted in a substantial reduction in both the number and functional capacity of ILC2s. Conclusion The recurrence of acute allergic asthma is driven, at least in part, by ILC2s through Il1rl1 signaling. Genetic ablation of Il1rl1 significantly suppresses asthma relapse, suggesting that targeting Il1rl1 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing asthma exacerbations.

        <tr id="Introduction Lymphopenia induced by radiotherapy or chemotherapy can promote homeostatic proliferation of residual or adoptive lymphocytes, potentially enhancing antitumor immunity. However, this immunity diminishes rapidly with tumor progression, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the role of PD-1 signaling in homeostatic proliferation–induced antitumor immunity in malignant melanoma. Methods We evaluated T-cell dynamics in lymphopenic mice, analyzing PD-1 expression, IFN-γ production by CD8+ T cells, and T-cell cytotoxicity during homeostatic proliferation. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis was blocked using anti-PD-1 antibodies to assess its impact on T-cell function, dendritic cell (DC) activation, and memory T-cell differentiation. Results Although T cells proliferated continuously in lymphopenic mice, IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells declined over time. PD-1 expression on T cells increased progressively and correlated negatively with effector T-cell cytotoxicity. PD-1 blockade enhanced the recognition of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by homeostatically proliferating (HP) T cells, activated DCs, and increased IFN-γ+ CD8+ T-cell numbers. Additionally, it boosted T-cell cytotoxicity and promoted the conversion of tumor-specific effector T cells into central memory T cells. Discussion These findings indicate that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis plays a critical role in immune tolerance during homeostatic proliferation. Anti-PD-1 therapy may enhance antitumor immunity during lymphopenia recovery after chemotherapy or radiotherapy, offering a potential strategy to sustain T-cell–mediated tumor control.">

        <tr id="Influenza remains a global health threat, infecting approximately one billion people annually and causing significant mortality, particularly among older adults. While hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers are a standard correlate of immunity against influenza, they do not reliably predict protection in high-risk populations. Using multiomic single-cell profiling, we identified a distinct subset of adaptive-like NK cells that respond to influenza antigen, predominantly in younger females. These TNFSF10+LGALS9+ NK cells exhibit features of adaptive NK cells but lack classical cytomegalovirus-driven markers observed in previous studies. Notably, their increased frequency correlates with high pre-existing HAI titers, suggesting a link between adaptive-like NK responses and humoral immunity. Together, our findings identify an NK subset influenced by age and sex that may contribute to influenza protection, expanding the known diversity of adaptive-like NK cells. These insights could inform future vaccine strategies, particularly for aging populations, by integrating NK responses into assessments of vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

        <tr id="Inhaled fungal pathogens often generate granuloma-contained latent infections that can reactivate to cause invasive disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate sterilizing immunity against latent infection remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry to characterize the immune dynamics and cellular architecture of cryptococcal granulomas. Using fate mapping and murine genetic tools, we demonstrate that alternative activation of monocyte-derived myeloid cells by CD4+ T helper 2 cells antagonizes pulmonary fungal clearance during latent infection. In contrast to the prevailing view in the field, we find that alternatively activated myeloid cells are not an intrinsic replication niche for the fungus and more broadly, Cryptococcus predominantly resides in the extracellular environment. We propose a T helper 2 cell-myeloid circuit establishes a local immunosuppressive environment to drive extracellular fungal persistence, which could be leveraged as a new target for host-directed therapy to treat latent fungal infections.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequence which ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular impact of sepsis remains rudimentary. Methods A mouse sepsis model was established through LPS induction and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect T helper 1 (Th1) cell subsets and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Additionally, in vivo neutralization experiments were conducted to block IFN-γ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, to explore the regulatory effect of DOCK2 on septic mice. Finally, the regulatory mechanism of DOCK2 was analyzed using an in vivo RNA-seq system. Results We identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. DOCK2-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced sepsis and E. coli sepsis with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-γ which were mainly due to hyperresponsive Th1 cells. Ulteriorly, we verified the vital role of DOCK2-mediated Th1 cells in sepsis by neutralizing both IFN-γ and CD4 and found both of which blockade reduced the severity of sepsis in Dock2−/− mice. Mechanically, DOCK2-mediated cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to govern peripheral Th1 cell fate. Conclusion Our data indicates that DOCK2 acts as a protective role in regulating systemic inflammation and multi-organ injury in bacterial sepsis by constraining Th1 response. These findings provide new targets for immunomodulatory therapy of sepsis, suggesting that targeting the DOCK2-Th1 axis may become a new strategy to improve systemic inflammatory responses associated with bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia and decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, it can be either congenital or acquired, predominantly affecting adolescents and the elderly, with higher incidence in Asia compared to Europe and America. Current treatment options include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppressive agents, yet proximately a third of patients fail to reach long-term survival. AA is primarily driven by immune-mediated destruction of HSPCs, initiated by self-activated T cells. Early stages feature a Th1 response, which later shifts to Th17 and effector memory CD8+ T cells. Key cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) play crucial roles in this immune dysregulation, influencing HSPCs and contributing to bone marrow failure. Furthermore, bone marrow macrophages (MΦ), particularly M1 subtype, are implicated in AA via the TNF-α/TNF-α receptor pathway, leading to T cell activating and subsequent HSPC damage. Interestingly, MΦ with high expression of IL-27Ra have been demonstrated to contribute to HSPC destruction in AA murine models. Beyond their role in thrombosis, platelets also participate in immune regulation. Some studies suggest that platelet may modulate T cell responses through mechanisms such as Akt-PGC1α-TFAM pathway or PF4-mediated activity, which could play a role in AA. However, direct evidence connecting platelet regulation to T cell-mediated HSPC damage is limited, and current research has largely focuses on CD8+ T cells. Moving forward, it is essential to investigate the interactions between platelets, CD4+ T cells, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In this review, we propose that platelet-derived factors such as PF4 and TGFβ may activate mitochondrial pathways, influencing T cell activation and leading to HSPC destruction in AA. This hypothesis could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AA and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies (Highlight).">

        <tr id="Background Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a severe complication in lung cancer, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the role of IL-6 in regulating immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE and evaluates the efficacy of dual IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade. Methods IL-6 levels were measured in MPE and paired serum samples from lung cancer patients, and correlations with PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes were analyzed using publicly available datasets. RNA sequencing and immune deconvolution were used to assess immune cell infiltration. CAFs and immune cell infiltration were further evaluated using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and multiplex immunofluorescence. In vitro co-culture systems were employed to simulate the MPE microenvironment and explore IL-6 interactions with CAFs, as well as its regulatory effect on tumor cell PD-L1 expression. Results IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in MPE compared to paired serum and correlated with higher PD-L1 expression and poor survival outcomes in lung cancer patients. In the MPE mouse model, combination therapy with IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade reduced MPE volume, tumor burden, and PD-L1 expression, while enhancing T cell infiltration and alleviating TME immunosuppression. IL-6 was found to drive a positive feedback loop with iCAFs, promoting an immunosuppressive environment. In vitro, IL-6 from the MPE upregulated tumor cell PD-L1 expression the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Conclusion This study identifies IL-6 as a critical contributor of immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE. The combination of IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade effectively alleviated immunosuppression and reduced tumor burden, offering a potential therapeutic approach for MPE management.

        <tr id="Background Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-natural killer (NK) cell therapy has demonstrated safety and feasibility in clinical settings; however, limited efficacy due to intrinsic dysfunction and extrinsic suppression remains an unresolved issue. T cells provide multifaceted support to NK cell-mediated responses. Here, we aimed to design a novel CD19-targeted CAR-NK, engineered with secreted interleukin-15 and C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (ie, 15×21 CAR-NK), capable of recruiting and cooperating with T cells. Methods We characterized 15×21 CAR-NK cells by performing experiments in vitro and in mouse models, and conducting RNA sequencing. Results 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibit strong capabilities in cytotoxicity, cytokine production, effector molecule expression, and T-cell recruitment in vitro. Cooperation with T cells promoted efficient tumor-cell elimination, alleviated mutual exhaustion phenotypes, and enhanced the expression of effector molecules/receptors. The recruitment and cooperative effects also result in effective tumor control in mouse models. In addition, 15×21 CAR-NK cells strongly enrich the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway - a key intracellular signaling cascade that is associated with enhanced downstream pro-survival signaling, anti-apoptotic ability, mitochondrial function, and cytotoxicity. Conclusions Our study highlights the intrinsic advantages and extrinsic T-cell cooperative benefits of 15×21 CAR-NK cells, providing a promising strategy for NK-cell-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Rationale: mRNA cancer vaccines show great promise for tumor therapy, but the therapeutic efficacy is limited. Metabolites play critical roles in immunomodulation. However, their role in mRNA cancer vaccines remains poorly understood. Methods: Metabolome analysis and single-cell RNA sequence were performed to explore the most important metabolite and its source cell. B16-F10-OVA-bearing wide-type and Irg1-depleted C57BL/6 mice were treated with OVA-LNP, OVA&si-Irg1-LNP, or anti-PD-1 antibody to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Flow cytometry analysis was used to examine the immune cells within the lymph nodes, spleens, and the tumor immune environment. Results: We found that macrophage-derived itaconate was increased markedly in activated ipsilateral lymph nodes after ovalbumin-encoding mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (OVA-LNP) injection, compared to homeostatic contralateral lymph nodes. Depleting the immune-responsive gene 1(Irg1), which encodes the itaconate-production enzyme aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), in macrophages improved dendritic cell antigen presentation and enhances T cell function. Combining Irg1 knockdown via small interfering RNA (siRNA) with OVA mRNA in LNPs augmented the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA cancer vaccines, both as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a link between itaconate and mRNA cancer vaccines, suggesting that targeting Irg1 via siRNA-LNP could be a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA cancer vaccines.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy, remains incurable and is highly prone to relapse. Immunosuppressive cells in the bone marrow environment inhibit endogenous T-lymphocytes activity and reduce the efficacy immunotherapies. Abnormal bone marrow monocytes in MM have been associated with inferior outcomes. This study explored the mechanism of T-lymphocytes suppression by bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in MM. Methods Single-cell RNA sequence data (GSE124310) derived from MM samples were analyzed. CD14+ monocytes from the bone marrow of patients with newly-diagnosed MM were detected, and RNA sequencing was performed. Interactions between CD14+ monocytes and T-lymphocytes, as along with the corresponding downstream signaling mechanism, were assessed through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The alterations in MHC II signaling related to outgoing interaction were decreased in CD14 + monocytes from patients with MM. Abnormal numbers, defective antigen presentation, and downregulated surface co-stimulatory molecules in bone marrow CD14+ monocytes were also observed. RNA sequencing identified upregulated expression of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2 (ULK2) in these monocytes, a protein involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathway. CD14+ monocytes from patients with NDMM suppressed T-lymphocyte activity, and treatment of CD14+ monocytes with a ULK1/ULK2 inhibitor alleviated this suppression. MM xenograft model showed that CD14+ monocytes high-expressing ULK2 suppressed T-lymphocytes and promoted tumor growth. Conclusion We demonstrated that CD14+ monocytes from MM can disrupt the delivery of antigenic peptides through the antigen processing and presentation pathway. This disruption affects T-lymphocytes activity and attenuates their ability to kill malignant cells and secrete cytokines. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the immuno-suppressive environment in MM, improving the efficacy of immunotherapy based on T-lymphocytes, and developing new therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="The barrier to HIV cure is the HIV reservoir, which is composed of latently infected CD4+ T cells and myeloid cells that carry stably integrated and replication-competent provirus. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) contains a substantial part of the HIV reservoir and its immunophysiology could be especially conducive for HIV persistence and reactivation. However, the exact cellular microenvironment and molecular mechanisms that govern the renewal of provirus-harboring cells and proviral reactivation in the GIT remain unclear. In this review, we outline the evidence supporting an overarching hypothesis that interferon activity driven by specialized enterocytes creates a microenvironment that fosters proliferation of latently infected CD4+ T cells and sporadic HIV reactivation from these cells. First, we describe unique immunologic features of the gastrointestinal associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), specifically highlighting IFN activity in specialized enterocytes and potential interactions between these cells and neighboring HIV susceptible cells. Then, we will describe dysregulation of IFN signaling in HIV infection and how IFN dysregulation in the GALT may contribute to the persistence and reactivation of the latent HIV reservoir. Finally, we will speculate on the clinical implications of this hypothesis for HIV cure strategies and outline the next steps.">

        <tr id="Aim: Mutations in key regulators of apoptosis have necessitated exploring the alternative cell death pathways like necroptosis in breast cancer (BC). Necroptosis is immunogenic due to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into extracellular environment, which can trigger pro- or anti-tumor immune responses. Inducing necroptosis in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC cells leads to the release of DAMPs, which can influence macrophages polarisation within the tumor microenvironment. The study aims to identify and characterize the DAMPs released from ER+ BC cells after necroptosis induction and to investigate their effects on macrophage properties. Methods: Necroptosis was induced by treating T-47D cells with Z-VAD-FMK and TNF-α (24 hours). The culture medium was collected as induction medium (IM). Necrostatin-1 alongside Z-VAD-FMK and TNF-α was added to inhibit necroptosis, the culture medium was collected as inhibition medium (InM) and used as a negative control for necroptosis. IM also referred as conditioned medium (CM), was analyzed using LC-MS/MS for the identification of DAMPs. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with the CM (24 hours), and their differentiation into M1 or M2 subtypes was assessed using qPCR, by evaluating the expression of specific M1 and M2 markers. Results: A total of 35 unique proteins with potential DAMP activity were identified in the IM. Functional and pathway analyses using PANTHER and DAVID revealed their involvement in immune regulation, metabolism, stress responses, and key pathways such as glycolysis, signaling, and inflammation. These proteins were primarily intracellular or secretory and included cytoskeletal components, chaperones, and binding modulators. Furthermore, IM treatment promoted THP-1 monocyte differentiation into both M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role of necroptosis in generating DAMPs, which can modulate macrophage differentiation within the BC microenvironment. The identified DAMPs hold potential for further investigation as prognostic or predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets in future studies.">

        <tr id="T-cell engagers represent a transformative approach to cancer immunotherapy leveraging bispecific and multispecific antibody constructs to redirect T-cell cytotoxicity toward malignant cells. These molecules bridge T cells and tumor cells by simultaneously binding CD3 on T cells and tumor-associated antigens on cancer cells, thereby enabling precise immune targeting even in immunologically “cold” tumors. Recent advancements include conditional T-cell engagers activated by tumor microenvironment proteases to minimize off-tumor toxicity as well as T-cell receptor–based engagers targeting intracellular antigens via MHC presentation. Clinical successes, such as Kimmtrak in metastatic uveal melanoma, underscore good potential of these modalities, while challenges persist in the management of cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and tumor resistance. Emerging multispecific engagers are aimed at enhancing efficacy via incorporation of costimulatory signals, thus offering a promising trajectory for next-generation immunotherapies. T-cell engagers are also gaining attention in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, where they can be designed to selectively modulate pathogenic immune responses. By targeting autoreactive T or B cells, T-cell engagers hold promise for restoring immune tolerance in such conditions as HLA-B*27–associated autoimmunity subtypes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Engineering strategies that incorporate inhibitory receptors or tissue-specific antigens may further refine T-cell engagers’ therapeutic potential in autoimmunity, by minimizing systemic immunosuppression while preserving immune homeostasis.">

This study compared the immunomodulatory effects of alpha-emitting (225Ac) and beta-emitting (177Lu) radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT) using NM600 in murine prostate cancer models. Methods We assessed immunological changes in TRAMP-C1 and Myc-CaP tumor models treated with 225Ac-NM600 or 177Lu-NM600. Flow cytometry was used to profile immune cell populations, activation markers, and checkpoint molecules, while multiplex assays analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression. Results In general, 225Ac-NM600 elicited stronger immunomodulatory effects than 177Lu-NM600, including cell line dependent increased CD8/Treg ratios, activation of effector and memory T cells, and depletion of suppressive Tregs and MDSCs. The treatment elevated Th1 cytokines, pro-inflammatory chemokines, and checkpoint molecules like PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 on MDSCs, creating a more “hot” TME. Conclusion Alpha-emitting 225Ac-NM600 demonstrated superior ability to enhance antitumor immunity compared to beta-emitting 177Lu-NM600. These findings support the use of 225Ac-NM600 in combination with immunotherapies for advanced prostate cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Despite the proven clinical activity of checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in several cancer indications, frequent occurrence of primary and secondary resistance reduces their overall effectiveness. Development of ICI resistance has been attributed mainly to genetic or epigenic alterations that affect the tumor antigen presentation machinery leading to diminished anti-tumor immune responses. There is an urgent need for new approaches which can either re-sensitize resistant tumors to the ICIs or engage alternate immune pathways to inhibit tumors. Intratumoral delivery of nanoparticle encapsulated murine IL12 (mIL12) mRNA induces powerful anti-tumor immune responses in murine tumor models, and the human version of this drug results in objective responses in patients with advanced disease. Here, we tested the efficacy of mIL12 mRNA as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibodies in ICI-sensitive Yummer 1.7 melanoma and MC38 colorectal murine tumors and in ICI resistant, β2-microglobulin (B2M) knockout versions of these models. mIL12 mRNA monotherapy was sufficient to cause complete responses (CRs) in ≥ 60% of both ICI-sensitive or -resistant Yummer 1.7 melanoma and MC38 colorectal carcinoma tumors. The mIL12 mRNA treatment resulted in potent upregulation of TH1 type cytokines and chemokines. A reduction in number of Tregs, increase in numbers and activation state of both cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) as well as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was observed indicating enhanced anti-tumor, cell-based immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. This mIL12-induced concerted immune activation was associated with a robust killing and phagocytosis of tumor cells resulting in durable CRs. These observations suggest that intratumoral IL12mRNA therapy may benefit patients with ICI-resistant cancers.

        <tr id="Background Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA) is an important therapeutic option for patients that incur debilitating injuries to the face or limbs. The complexity and immunogenicity of tissue types within VCA grafts pose unique challenges and necessitate the use of intensive immunosuppression; however, graft rejection remains a challenge in VCA. Methods Deep proteomic profiling and high dimensional analysis with cytometry time of flight were used to define the cell types and effector mechanisms elicited by VCA in BALB/c (H-2Kd) > C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) limb recipients. Spleen and cervical draining lymph nodes were collected post-transplant days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (n =4–6 mice/group/day). We identified dynamic, coordinated signatures in T cell and monocyte populations associated with VCA allograft rejection. Results In comparison to syngeneic transplant recipients, allogeneic recipients exhibited significant alterations in the immune cell populations within secondary lymphoid tissues. These changes included very early expansion of double-negative TCRβ- T cells, including IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, and patrolling monocytes. Subsequently, CD8+CD62L+ T cells and CD8+ effector/effector memory T cells (Teff/Tem), Ly6ChiCCR2hiCX3CR1low classical monocytes, CD4+ Teff/Tem, and CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem were increased by day 5. CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem with the highest expression of IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme B were enriched by day 7. Conclusions High dimensional proteomic analysis reveals multiple innate and Teff/Tem subsets in acute rejection following VCA. In particular, IL-17A-producing γδ T cells and classical monocytes may be particularly important in initiating the alloimmune response in VCA recipients.">

        <tr id="Background The treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), a leading cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer, is complicated by type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to investigate the CRLM immune microenvironment in the context of T2D and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A hyperglycemic CRLM mouse model was established. Seven single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed, including three peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) datasets (from healthy donors and T2D patients) and four datasets with 20 CRLM samples and matching PBMCs datasets, to explore the immune characteristics and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in CRLM with concurrent T2D. Results CD8+T cells exhibited dysfunction and exhaustion in liver metastasis from patients with CRLM and T2D; the proportions of various CD4+T cell subpopulations were also altered, and the number of myeloid cells and their function was increased. Myeloid cells in CRLM from patients with T2D exhibited high expression levels of CCL3, which recruited peripheral blood monocytes expressing high levels of CCR1, leading to an accumulation of myeloid cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recruited cells exhibited enhanced T cell communication abilities, indicating an augmented immunosuppressive capacity. In addition, CCR1 expression in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with CRLM was closely correlated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting that CCR1 expression levels may predict immune cell phenotype and prognosis in patients with CRLM and T2D. Conclusions Our study revealed complex changes in the tumor microenvironment of patients with CRLM and T2D. In particular, a novel mechanism was identified by which hyperglycemia regulates immunosuppression: the CCL3–CCR1 signaling axis. This finding offers a novel potential therapeutic target for patients with CRLM and T2D and provides an important theoretical basis for the future prediction of the prognosis of these patients.">

        <tr id="Background Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with over-activation, which contributes to disease progression. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates play a critical role in HIV-1 infection. However, research on the characteristics of platelet-natural killer (NK) cell aggregates in HIV-infected individuals still has certain limitations. Methods Platelet-NK cell aggregates in the peripheral blood of participants were detected by flow cytometry and confirmed by imaging flow cytometry. Platelet activation was evaluated by CD62P expression. The expression of various activating and inhibitory receptors, markers of apoptosis, lipid droplets, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Granzyme B, and Perforin in platelet-NK cell aggregates were assessed. The signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAM) family receptors in both platelets and NK cells and the levels of phosphorylation signals in NK cells were respectively measured through flow cytometry. Results In this study, we observed an increase in platelet-NK cell aggregates that were negatively correlated with CD4 count, a prognostic marker for HIV-1 disease progression. Furthermore, platelet activation was inversely associated with both HIV-1 disease progression and the platelet-NK cell aggregates. However, antiretroviral therapy (ART) couldn’t restore the levels of these aggregates or platelet activation. Compared to platelet-free NK cells, platelet-NK cell aggregates exhibited over-activation (CD69) and exhaustion phenotypes (CD39, LAG-3, PD-1), increased levels of apoptosis (Annexin V and CD95) and lipid droplets (Bodipy 493/503 and LipidTOX). Furthermore, NK cells' cytokine secretion (IFN-γ) and cytotoxic function (Granzyme B and Perforin) within the aggregates were declined. Screening results of SLAM receptors in NK cells and platelets suggested that platelets may transmit signals to NK cells via SLAMF5. Moreover, elevated levels of p-Fyn, p-PLC-γ2, p-SHP-1, and p-SHP-2 denoted disturbances in the downstream signals of the SLAM family within platelet-NK cell aggregates. Conclusion Our study indicates that platelet-NK cell aggregates exhibit characteristics of over-activation and dysfunction during HIV-1 infection. Hyperactivated platelets and the formation of platelet-NK cell aggregates contribute to the HIV-1 disease progression and the inflammation of the immune system. These findings may implicate potential targets of overactivated platelets for HIV-1 disease progression.

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) immunotherapy has been revolutionized by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), yet response heterogeneity persists due to dynamic tumor-immune interactions. This review summarizes recent studies in understanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) biology, highlighting CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as pivotal regulators of immune surveillance and suppression. We summarize emerging biomarkers such as TCR clonality, spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and exhaustion markers including PD-1, TCF1, and TIM-3, which predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy beyond PD-L1 expression. This review specifically describes radiotherapy-induced immunogenic remodeling and peripheral T cell dynamics as innovative strategies to monitor immune response and resistance mechanisms. By integrating results from single-cell omics and AI-driven spatial analysis, we propose multidimensional frameworks of TIL in NSCLC to overcome resistance and optimize immunotherapy combinations. These insights collectively advance NSCLC immunotherapy toward precision modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Programmed Death Receptor-1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on the surface of T cells. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, are among the most widely utilized immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy, dramatically improving the prognosis of patients with various malignancies. Traditionally, platelets, which are cytoplasmic fragments derived from megakaryocytes, have been primarily recognized for their roles in hemostasis and coagulation. However, recent studies have highlighted the emerging role of platelets in cancer biology and therapy. Platelets can modulate immune cell functions through various mechanisms, including the release of bioactive molecules and direct interactions with immune cells. A deeper understanding of the interplay between platelets and immune responses could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment. In our research, in patients with better treatment responses, there are higher levels of mature and activated CD8+ T cells in their PBMCs prior to treatment. Additionally, the activation of platelets is also more pronounced, and the proteins expressed on these platelets may modulate immune cells. After receiving immunotherapy, patients in the responsive (R) group exhibited a higher abundance of activated effector CD8+ T cells, which demonstrated stronger immune response capabilities. Furthermore, the increased levels of activated platelets in the R group may contribute to the regulation of CD8+ effector memory T cells, influencing their quantity and function. Our study suggests that the functional state of CD8+ T cells and the level of activated platelets prior to treatment may serve as predictive indicators for the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in head and neck cancer patients. Activated CD8+ effector T cells may contribute to the differences in immunotherapy responses, with activated platelets playing a role in promoting the maturation and activation of CD8+ effector memory T cells.These insights help better understand the interactions between platelets and immune cells, particularly emphasizing the role of CD8+ effector memory T cells in immunotherapy. Additionally, they offer potential strategies for predicting patient responses to PD-1 inhibitor treatment and optimizing the efficacy of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="IL-17A-expressing lymphocytes, including Tc17 cells, are instrumental in immunity, immunopathology, and autoimmunity. We have previously shown that experimental attenuated live fungal vaccine-induced Tc17 cells are stable, long-lived without plasticity, and necessary to mediate sterilizing immunity during CD4+ T cell deficiency, which poses higher susceptibility to fungal infections. Cell metabolism is integral for T cell homeostasis but the metabolic adaptations of Tc17 cells are poorly defined. In this study, we hypothesized that effector Tc17 cells adopt high energy-yielding metabolic pathways to form stable, long-lived memory cells in vivo. Using a mouse model of attenuated fungal vaccination, we found that effector Tc17 cells were metabolically highly active with higher proliferation and protein synthesis than IFNγ+ CD8+ T (Tc1) cells. Glucose was necessary for effector Tc17 cell expansion but with less dependency during the late expansion despite the active metabolism. Contrary to established dogma, we found that the effector Tc17 cells preferentially channeled the glucose to OXPHOS than glycolysis, which was correlated with higher mitochondrial mass and membrane potential. Inhibition of OXPHOS shrunk the Tc17 responses while sparing Tc1 cell responses. Tc17 cells actively relied on OXPHOS throughout the expansion period, resisting adaptation to aerobic glycolysis. Our data showed that the effector Tc17 cells predominantly utilize glucose for metabolism through OXPHOS rather than aerobic glycolysis. Our study has implications in vaccine design to enhance the efficacy and immunotherapeutics to modulate the immunity and autoimmunity.">

Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms.">

        <tr id="The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a neurotropic flavivirus, poses a formidable global health challenge due to its severe neurological sequelae and high lethality. Peripheral immune effectors, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and T lymphocytes, act as principal vectors of neuropathogenic exacerbation by translocating across a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB). These cells perpetuate an inflammatory cascade within the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by unchecked cytokine dysregulation and collateral neuronal destruction. Exosomes, diminutive extracellular vesicles, emerge as cryptic propagators of JEV neuropathogenesis. Acting as molecular couriers, these vesicles disseminate viral RNA and proinflammatory mediators, thus orchestrating neuronal apoptosis and fostering a pernicious inflammatory microenvironment. Exosomal trafficking exacerbates BBB destabilization, potentiates immune cell ingress into the CNS, and establishes a deleterious feedback mechanism of neuroinflammation and cellular attrition. This review underscores the intricate crosstalk between peripheral immune infiltrates and exosomal vectors in JEV progression, advocating for advanced therapeutic paradigms aimed at intercepting exosomal biogenesis, attenuating immune hyperactivation, and preserving BBB integrity to mitigate CNS devastation.">

        <tr id="Innate immune memory, also called trained immunity, is a metabolic and epigenetically regulated process that enables innate immune cells to recalibrate their inflammatory reactivity in response to pathogenic or endogenous stimuli. In addition to its function in host defense, trained immunity contributes to diverse immune-mediated diseases. We discovered that complement component 1q (C1q) is an effective modulator of innate immune memory, potently suppressing the responsiveness of myeloid cells. We found that C1q leads to profound reprogramming of myeloid cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis, and exerts control over the transcriptional regulation of important metabolic and inflammatory genes. We corroborate our findings by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms close to the C1q gene that are linked to induction of trained immunity by Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) or beta-glucan in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results reveal an immunomodulatory role for C1q and provide evidence of a molecular interaction between the complement system and innate immune memory. These findings expand our understanding of innate immune memory.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following lung cancer. Despite the immune system’s capacity for tumor surveillance and elimination, CRC tumors can evade immune responses through complex mechanisms, ultimately escaping immune detection. T and B lymphocytes play a critical role in adaptive immunity against tumors, with T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, driving tumor elimination. Additionally, B cells contribute by producing tumor-specific antibodies, including various immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses that participate in immune modulation. However, the effectiveness of adaptive immunity in CRC is often limited due to tumor-driven immunosuppression. This study investigates the expression of T and B cell activation genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CRC patients. A panel of 84 genes involved in T and B cell activation was analyzed to assess changes in expression using RT2 QPCR arrays. Additionally, we measured serum levels of the four IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) in CRC patients to explore possible alterations in humoral immunity. Compared to healthy controls, 5 genes were found to be downregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCL3 (fold regulation − 6.36), IL6 (fold regulation − 12.46), CSF2 (fold regulation − 7.50), CXCR3 (fold regulation − 3.01), and TNFSF14 (fold regulation − 4.90). Moreover, 13 genes were upregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCR3 (fold regulation 59.21), CD2 (fold regulation 3.07), CD27 (fold regulation 6.39), CD3G (fold regulation 4.15), CD8B (fold regulation 3.25), FAS (fold regulation 3.94), IL10 (fold regulation 39), IL18R1 (fold regulation 82.39), IL5 (fold regulation 20.4), LAG3 (fold regulation 19.88), MAP3K7 (fold regulation 4.07), TLR1 (fold regulation 6.45), and TLR6 (fold regulation 18.87). The serum levels of the four IgG subclasses were however statistically insignificant in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive immune dysfunction in CRC, offering a detailed profile of gene expression changes associated with T and B cell activation and antibody production. Understanding these dysregulations may enhance the development of targeted immunotherapies, potentially improving outcomes for CRC patients through more personalized immunomodulatory approaches.

In this study, we focus on identifying and characterizing CD73+CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), aiming to elucidate their functional and phenotypic roles in tumor immunity. Methods Using flow cytometry, we analyzed the expression of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1, TIM-3) and activating markers (e.g., CD25, CD69) on CD73+CD8+ T cells compared to CD73−CD8+ T cells. In vitro functional assays were conducted to assess their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, including cytokine production and tumor cell killing capacity. Results CD73+CD8+ T cells exhibited a distinct immunophenotypic profile, characterized by reduced expression of inhibitory receptors and enhanced cytotoxic activity compared to their CD73− counterparts. These cells demonstrated higher levels of effector molecules (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) and lower exhausted markers. The findings suggest that CD73+CD8+ T cells may retain stronger anti-tumor potential. Discussion This study highlights CD73+CD8+ T cells as a unique functional subset with potential therapeutic relevance in DLBCL. Their reduced exhaustion and heightened cytotoxicity position them as promising targets for immunotherapy strategies. However, the dual role of CD73 in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression warrants further investigation to reconcile its pro-tumorigenic effects with the observed anti-tumor activity of CD73+CD8+ T cells. Our findings deepen the understanding of CD8+ T cell heterogeneity in DLBCL and emphasize the need for mechanistic studies to explore CD73’s context-dependent functions.">

        <tr id="Background Psoriasis is a systemic, immune-mediated, inflammatory skin disease in which T cells have been found to play a significant role. The phenotypic and functional properties of circulating CD8 T cells in the pathogenesis of the disease are still ill-defined. Objective This study aimed to assess changes in the phenotype, activation status and mediator release of CD8 T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis and healthy individuals were used to investigate the CD8 T cell immune phenotype and mediator release upon in vitro TCR-independent (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin (ION)) or TCR-dependent (anti-CD3/CD28) activation by flow cytometry. Results Patients with psoriasis exhibited reduced circulating CD8 memory T cell frequency compared to healthy controls. Additionally, although CD8 T cell subsets showed similar levels of the skin homing marker CCR4, they demonstrated a significant upregulation of B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) expression compared to healthy individuals. Upon CD8 T cell activation, IL-17A and IL-17F were expressed at low and comparable levels in psoriasis patients and healthy controls. In contrast, CD69, IFNγ, and Granzyme B were significantly decreased in anti-CD3/CD28-activated CD8 T cell subsets. PASI scores positively correlated with IFNγ-producing CD8 T memory cells and negatively with TNF-producing CD8- T cell subsets. Conclusion Patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis showed a significant decrease in CD8 T memory cells and reduced release of cytotoxic mediators by CD8 T cells. Thus, this indicates that psoriasis impacts the functionality of circulating CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Local chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a driver of systemic inflammatory comorbidities; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the impact of periodontitis on the reprogramming of bone marrow hematopoiesis, with a focus on neutropoiesis bias and its contribution to the exacerbation of arthritis. Methods: Single-cell multiomics sequencing was performed on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) isolated from control and ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) mice to characterize transcriptional and epigenetic alterations. Differentiation trajectories and key transcription factors (TFs) governing neutrophil lineage commitment were identified. Neutrophil priming was assessed using Smart-seq2, bulk RNA-seq, and lipopolysaccharide stimulation assays. The functional role of primed neutrophils in arthritis was evaluated through adoptive transfer, in vivo tracking, and functional blockade within a collagen antibody-induced arthritis model. Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling was interrogated using Ifnar1⁻/⁻ mice and neutralizing antibodies to elucidate mechanistic pathways. Reversibility of neutropoiesis bias and arthritis aggravation was examined following ligature removal to model periodontitis resolution. Results: Transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiling demonstrated that LIP induces a selective skewing of HSPC differentiation toward the neutrophil lineage. This reprogramming results in sustained expansion of primed neutrophils, which contribute to the aggravation of distal arthritis. Mechanistically, elevated IFN-I levels promote continuous neutropoiesis bias through activation of IFN-I signaling in HSPCs. Rarg and Nr2f6 were identified as potential TFs contributing to IFN-I-mediated neutrophil lineage commitment. Notably, resolution of periodontitis reversed the hematopoietic bias and mitigated arthritis progression. Conclusions: Periodontitis exacerbates arthritis through IFN-I-mediated neutropoiesis bias, emphasizing the necessity of controlling local chronic inflammation in the management of systemic inflammatory comorbidities.">

        <tr id="Introduction Although T-cell immunotherapies have been effective in the treatment of hematological malignancies, solid tumors have proven challenging due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and lack of viable target antigens. The immune checkpoint ligand CD70, overexpressed in several solid tumors, yet with limited expression in healthy tissue, has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic target. Method This study describes the generation and preclinical characterization of ADP-520, a high-affinity, fratricide-resistant, CD70-targeted T-cell receptor fusion construct (TRuC) T-cell therapy enhanced with constitutively expressed mbIL-15, a membrane-bound fusion protein comprising interleukin-15 (IL-15) linked to full-length IL-15 receptor-alpha. The phenotypic distribution, expansion and persistence of ADP-520 TRuC T cells were measured in vitro under autonomous and antigen-dependent conditions, with the contributions of TCR and IL-15 signaling pathways ascertained using inhibition assays. Chronic antigen stimulation was used to evaluate exhaustion-resistance, while anti-tumor potency was explored both in vitro and in vivo. Results ADP-520 was found to have potent and antigen-specific activity against hematological and solid CD70-expressing tumors, without apparent fratricide or killing of bystander T cells despite CD70 expression by activated lymphocytes. Engineered co-expression of mbIL-15 augmented antigen-dependent expansion through pro-survival effects and enrichment of an early memory T-cell phenotype, thus enhancing tumor-autonomous, exogenous cytokine-free persistence and bolstering exhaustion resistance during chronic stimulation. mbIL-15 co-expression also enhanced intratumoral T-cell infiltration in vivo for potent and persistent antitumor efficacy. Discussion These findings characterize ADP-520 as a first-in-class, CD70-targeted, fratricide-resistant autologous TRuC T-cell therapy leveraging native TCR signaling combined with constitutive IL-15 signaling to impart T cells with enhanced persistence, tumor penetration, and antitumor efficacy. This makes ADP-520 a promising cell immunotherapy candidate for clinical development, with the potential to overcome hurdles intrinsic to the treatment of solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a diverse population of immune cells that play a central role in tumor immunity and have emerged as critical mediators in cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the phenotypic and functional diversity of TILs—including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells—and their dynamic interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). While TILs can drive tumor regression, their activity is often hindered by immune checkpoint signaling, metabolic exhaustion, and stromal exclusion. We highlight TIL recruitment, activation, and polarization mechanisms, focusing on chemokine gradients, endothelial adhesion molecules, and dendritic cell-mediated priming. Special emphasis is placed on preclinical models that evaluate TIL function, including 3D tumor spheroids, organoid co-cultures, syngeneic mouse models, and humanized systems. These provide valuable platforms for optimizing TIL-based therapies. Furthermore, we examine the prognostic and predictive value of TILs across cancer types, their role in adoptive cell therapy, and the challenges of translating preclinical success into clinical efficacy. Emerging technologies such as single-cell sequencing, neoantigen prediction, and biomaterial platforms are transforming our understanding of TIL biology and enhancing their therapeutic potential. Innovative strategies—ranging from genetic engineering and combination therapies to targeted modulation of the TME—are being developed to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve TIL persistence, infiltration, and cytotoxicity. This review integrates current advances in TIL research and therapy, offering a comprehensive foundation for future clinical translation. TILs hold significant promise as both biomarkers and therapeutic agents, and with continued innovation, they are poised to become a cornerstone of personalized cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Psoriasis is defined as a persistent autoimmune disease characterized by the appearance of psoriatic lesions on the surface of the skin. Currently, various approaches including chemicals, corticosteroids, phototherapy, and biological agents are being proposed and implemented to improve psoriatic lesions by modulating immune system activity or metabolic processes, often with unintended consequences and side effects. Currently, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have attracted considerable interest among researchers due to their ability to modulate immune responses and their ease of application, representing a promising strategy for alleviating clinical symptoms in the treatment of allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and more. This study will investigate how MSCs interact with immune system cells involved in psoriasis development, such as neutrophils, keratinocytes, dendritic cells (DC), and T cell subtypes, for potential therapeutic use in psoriasis management. In this case, several immunomodulatory mechanisms are involved, including expression of chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase and other factors involved in cell proliferation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation are among the effects of MSCs on keratinocytes and neutrophils. keratinocytes and neutrophils as pro-inflammatory cells involved in psoriasis pathogenesis and pathogenesis and progression of psoriasis. On the other hand, MSCs interact with DCs and various subsets of T cells, including Th1, Th2, Th17 and Tregs, to generate tolerogenic DCs and increase the differentiation of Tregs and modulate the Th17/Treg towards a regulatory state through overexpression of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory and immunomodulatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth Factor beta (TGF-β). Finally, we will focus on the challenges and obstacles in psoriasis treatment using MSCs, including limitations in the case of using MSCs from different sources and side effects that may be encountered by whole cell therapy strategies, which are attracting attention towards the implication of cell-free regimens such as using MSC-derived secretome or extracellular vesicles and exosomes to provide similar therapeutic outcomes without presumed side effects.

        <tr id="P.falciparum infection can trigger high levels of inflammation that lead to fever and sometimes severe disease. People living in malaria-endemic areas gradually develop resistance to symptomatic malaria and control both parasite numbers and the inflammatory response. We previously found that adaptive NK cells correlated with reduced parasite load and protection from symptoms. We also found that murine NK cell production of IL-10 protected mice from experimental cerebral malaria. Human NK cells can also secrete IL-10, but it is unknown what NK cell subsets produce IL-10 or if this is affected by malaria experience. We hypothesized that NK cell immunoregulation may lower inflammation and reduce fever induction. Here, we showed that NK cells from participants with malaria experience make significantly more IL-10 than participants with no malaria experience. We then determined the proportions of NK cells that are cytotoxic and produce IFN-γ and/or IL-10 and identified a signature of adaptive and checkpoint molecules on IL-10–producing NK cells. Lastly, we found that coculture with primary monocytes, Plasmodium-infected RBCs, and antibody induced IL-10 production by NK cells. These data suggest that NK cells may contribute to protection from malaria symptoms via IL-10 production.">

It is associated with fibrocyte proliferation and collagen deposition, leading to severe, irreversible lung function decline. Despite extensive research, the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis are complicated and have no effective treatment. During the formation of pulmonary fibrosis, immune dysregulation by inflammatory cell infiltration is the key driver of pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, single-cell sequencing analysis of silicosis mice showed that various cells in the alveolar immune microenvironment are involved in forming pulmonary fibrosis, such as macrophages, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, etc. Among them, T cell subpopulations in silicosis mice were significantly activated, indicating that T lymphocyte subsets play an essential role in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. More and more pulmonary clinical studies show that T lymphocytes in the lung immune microenvironment play an important and multifaceted role. This article summarizes the role of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells in pulmonary fibrosis.

Progress in immunopharmacology, aided by single-cell analytics, increasingly highlights immune complexity and functional heterogeneity. Conventional categories contain diverse subsets, including various T cells (helper, regulatory, memory) and B cells (plasma, memory, regulatory). Innate immune cells like macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells also exist in various functional states. These subsets exhibit distinct pharmacological response profiles that are often obscured by bulk analyses. This review explores the differential responses of critical immune cell subsets within the gastric cancer tumor microenvironment to current therapeutic modalities, encompassing cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular targeted agents, and immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. We delve into the molecular processes underlying subset-specific drug effects, potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance linked to specific immune cell states, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment on immune subset pharmacology. Furthermore, we discuss the application and potential of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems specifically engineered to target distinct immune cell subpopulations, aiming to enhance immunomodulatory efficacy, reshape subset repertoires favorably, overcome resistance, and minimize toxicity for more precise and effective treatment of advanced gastric cancer.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, play crucial roles in cancer progression by mediating the communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment. Cancer cell-derived EVs promote tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion by carrying bioactive materials, such as proteins, RNAs, DNA fragments, and lipids but, immunotherapy aims to enhance the immune response against cancer; however, resistance remains a major challenge. Cancer cell-derived EVs contribute to this resistance by delivering immunosuppressive molecules that impair T cell activation, promote the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and reduce natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, thereby allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. Additionally, cancer cell-derived EVs can carry immune checkpoint proteins, such as Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), which bind to the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells, leading to T cell exhaustion and reduced anti-tumor activity. This mechanism reflects how cancer cells directly evade immune detection and contributes to the overall resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. By delivering these immunomodulatory molecules, EVs not only contribute to local immune suppression but also create a systemic environment that is less favorable for effective anticancer immunity. Therefore, understanding the role of EVs in the immunotherapy resistance is crucial for developing targeted strategies to counteract their effects and ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes. Here we encourage researchers to pay more attention to the role of cancer cell-derived EVs in overcoming immunotherapeutic resistance, because such efforts may be one of the most promising approaches to address immunotherapy resistance in the future.">

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

Myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are involved in the development and progression of immune aplastic anemia (AA). We used a murine model of BMF to explore the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on immune pathophysiology. Hematopoiesis, immune cell populations, and gene expression were assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing. CSF-1R inhibition with the small molecule PLX3397 intensified BMF in CByB6F1 mice, enhancing inflammation and macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This was accompanied by increased leukocyte apoptosis, a reduction in CD11b+ myeloid cells, and worsened animal survival. In contrast, the JAK-inhibitor baricitinib attenuated BMF, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed upregulation of M1 signature genes in both murine BMF and also AA human samples. In patients with severe AA, there was a shift towards an M1-like monocyte phenotype, correlating with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and altered MDSC populations. These findings highlight the role of myeloid-derived cells in BMF and suggest that M1 macrophages, with defective MDSC function, contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. Targeting macrophage polarization or MDSCs offers alternative therapeutic strategies in immune-mediated BMF.">

        <tr id="The immune mechanisms induced by the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, and the subset of which mediate protection against tuberculosis (TB), remain poorly understood. This is further complicated by difficulties to verify vaccine-induced protection in humans. Although research in animal models, namely mice and non-human primates (NHPs), has begun to close this knowledge gap, discrepancies in the relative importance of biological pathways across species limit the utility of animal model-derived biological insights in humans. To address these challenges, we applied a systems modeling framework, Translatable Components Regression (TransCompR), to identify human blood transcriptional variability which could predict Mtb challenge outcomes in BCG-vaccinated NHPs. These protection-associated pathways included both innate and adaptive immune activation mechanisms, along with signaling via type I interferons and anti-mycobacterial T helper cytokines. We further partially validated the associations between these mechanisms and protection in humans using publicly available microarray data collected from BCG-vaccinated infants who either developed TB or remained healthy during two years of follow-up. Overall, our work demonstrates how species translation modeling can leverage animal studies to generate hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie human infectious disease and vaccination outcomes, which may be difficult or impossible to ascertain using human data alone.">

Residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression by regulating diverse signaling pathways. Notably, accumulating evidence has confirmed that TAMs interplay with various cellular components within the TME directly or indirectly to maintain the dynamic balance of the M1/M2 ratio and shape an immunosuppressive TME, consequently conferring immune evasion and immunotherapy tolerance. Detailed investigation of the communication network around TAMs could provide potential molecular targets and optimize ICI therapies. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in understanding the origin and functional plasticity of TAMs, with a focus on the key signaling pathways driving macrophage polarization and the diverse stimuli that regulate this dynamic process. Moreover, we elaborate on the intricate interplay between TAMs and other cellular constituents within the TME, that is driving tumor initiation, progression and immune evasion, exploring novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. We further discuss current challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need to decode TAM-TME interactions and translate preclinical findings into clinical breakthroughs. In conclusion, while TAM-targeted therapies hold significant promise for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes, addressing key challenges—such as TAM heterogeneity, context-dependent plasticity, and therapeutic resistance—remains critical to achieving optimal clinical efficacy.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Conventional therapies are frequently limited by tumor heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Dendritic cells (DCs), central to orchestrating antitumor immunity, have become key targets for HCC immunotherapy. This review examines the biological functions of DC subsets (cDC1, cDC2, pDC, and moDC) and their roles in initiating and modulating immune responses against HCC. We detail the mechanisms underlying DC impairment within the TME, including suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Additionally, we discuss novel DC-based therapeutic strategies, such as DC-based vaccines designed to enhance antigen presentation and T cell activation. Combining DC vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockers, demonstrates synergistic effects that can overcome immune evasion and improve clinical outcomes. Despite progress, challenges related to DC subset heterogeneity, TME complexity, and patient variability require the further optimization and personalization of DC-based therapies. Future research should focus on refining these strategies, leveraging advanced technologies like genomic profiling and artificial intelligence, to maximize therapeutic efficacy and revolutionize HCC treatment. By restoring DC function and reprogramming the TME, DC-based immunotherapy holds immense potential to transform the management of HCC and improve patient survival.">

We found the leukemic stroma cells with high level of TGFβ1 secretion can determine TAMs toward M2-polarized subtype. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that bone marrow stromal cells with specific glycans, reduced bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) levels, in MDS/AML promoted M2-polarized subtype through the secretion of TGFβ1, which elevated PD-L1 expression and thereby impaired CD8+ T cell function.

Notably, macrophage subpopulations affected by polyamine metabolism have strong prognostic value, especially in immunotherapy patients. We found that changes in these subpopulations correlate with thyroid cancer development, and tumor tissue can regulate macrophage polyamine metabolism.

        <tr id="Introduction Microvascular injury is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis, but its interaction with the immune system in early infection is unclear. This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

        <tr id="Background Ovarian cancer (OC) progression is heavily influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), where immune suppression plays a critical role. This study explores the role of thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) in regulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T cell exhaustion, and immune checkpoint expression, as well as its transcriptional regulation by SNF2H. Methods We analyzed THBS1 expression and its clinical significance using publicly available datasets (TCGA-OV, GSE14407) and tissue microarrays containing OC and adjacent normal tissues. In vitro functional studies were conducted using OC cell lines (SKOV3, A2780) and co-cultures with macrophages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and RNA interference were employed to investigate SNF2H-mediated transcriptional regulation of THBS1. In vivo, the role of THBS1 in immune suppression was validated using mouse tumor models. Results THBS1 was significantly overexpressed in OC tissues and associated with poor prognosis. High levels of THBS1 correlated with increased TAM infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization, and upregulation of immune checkpoints PD-L1 and GAL-3, which contribute to T cell exhaustion. Functional assays demonstrated that THBS1 promotes macrophage recruitment and induces M2 polarization through TGF-β1 and IL-4 signaling. Additionally, ChIP assays identified SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, contributing to its overexpression. In vitro targeting of THBS1 reduced TAM-mediated immune suppression and restored T cell cytotoxicity. Conclusion This study positions THBS1 as a key regulator of the OC TME, linking TAM recruitment and polarization to CD8+ T cell exhaustion via immune checkpoint modulation. By identifying SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, we offer new insights into its epigenetic dysregulation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to reprogram the TME and improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

This review explores the complex interactions between CAFs and dendritic cells (DCs), essential antigen-presenting cells that activate immune responses. CAFs impair DC maturation and function by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, reducing their ability to present antigens and stimulate T cells, thus promoting an immunosuppressive environment favorable to tumor growth. Additionally, CAFs contribute to the differentiation of tolerogenic DCs, fostering regulatory T cells (Tregs) that further suppress antitumor immunity.

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the first line of defense in nonspecific immunity (innate immunity) and interact with other immune cells to participate in specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity). Studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediates tumor development and recruits neutrophils into tumors to become tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), an important part of TME, and achieve extended lifespan. TANs can be differentiated into the antitumor or protumor phenotype, and play an important role in tumor occurrence, proliferation and recurrence, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, cell necrosis, and so on. Here, we summarize the TAN origin and subtypes found through Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in different types of tumors in recent literature, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their antitumor and protumor effects on tumors. We focus on the interaction between TANs and immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory TME, as well as signal pathways such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) associated with TAN phenotype transition. Based on the summarized mechanisms, we focus on the potential application and latest strategies of TAN-based immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and combination therapy in the preclinical study and clinical trials of tumors. The discussion on promising therapy encompasses five key areas: inhibition of the tumor-promoting effect of TANs, enhancement of the antitumor effect of TANs, targeting the interaction between TANs and the TME, reprogramming of TANs, and drug delivery carriers. Finally, we discuss the potential of TANs and their related markers as emerging biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising therapeutic approach in viral infection management. However, their interaction with viruses remains poorly understood. MSCs can support antiviral immune responses and act as viral reservoirs, potentially compromising their therapeutic potential. Innate immune system recognition of viral pathogens involves pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which activate mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS triggers antiviral pathways like IRF3 and NF-κB, leading to interferon (IFN) production and pro-inflammatory responses. This study explores the antiviral response in umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) through targeted stimulation with influenza A virus-derived 5′triphosphate-RNA (3p-hpRNA), a RIG-I agonist. By investigating MAVS activation, we provide mechanistic insights into the immune response at the molecular level. Our findings reveal that 3p-hpRNA stimulation triggers immune activation of the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways through MAVS. Subsequently, this leads to the induction of type I and III IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Critically, this immune activation occurs without compromising mitochondrial integrity. UC-MSCs retain their capacity for mitochondrial transfer to recipient cells. These results highlight the adaptability of UC-MSCs, offering a nuanced understanding of immune responses balancing activation with metabolic integrity. Finally, our research provides mechanistic evidence for MSC-based interventions against viral infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Most exhaustion studies have focused on CD8+ T cells. Here, we demonstrated reciprocal growth inhibition of CD4+ T cells and colorectal cancer cells, which induced the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in CD4+ T cells. The accelerated exhaustion of CD4+ T cells was evidenced by the reduced secretion of several cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-γ, or TNFα, and elevated secretion of CXCL family chemokines. Progressive expression of PD-L1, CTLA4, and IDO1 exhaustion markers occurred concomitantly with tumor growth in vivo in a mouse model. The pattern of CD4+ T cell exhaustion was analogous to that observed in CD8+ T cells, although with altered dynamics. The PD-L1-high phenotype can be induced by co-culture with tumor cells and is mediated by secreted factors in addition to cell contact. Our findings revealed that IFN-γ receptor knockout T cells exhibited PD-L1 protein expression when cultured with tumor cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is not fully dependent on IFN-γ. The TIL population undergoing exhaustion due to persistent antigen stimulation in the presence of cancer cells gradually acquires an immunosuppressive phenotype. The accumulation of inhibitory signals exerted by both cancer cells and T cells, which had converted to a suppressive phenotype, accelerated T cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Despite their synovial enrichment Regulatory T cells (Treg) fail to alleviate the joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This indicates their functional impairment in the synovial milieu of RA patients.


RESULTS
Here, we demonstrate that deficit in PD-1 pathway incapacitates the synovial Treg cells and engaging PD-1 restores their suppressive function (IL-10, TGF-β secretion) which in turn suppressed the synovial inflammatory T cells (IFN-γ+, IL-17+ TNF-α+). We also showed deficit in programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on RA synovial macrophages contributes to impaired Treg cell function.


CONCLUSION
Rejuvenating synovial Treg cell function via PD-1 engagement may be a potential strategy to ameliorate the synovial inflammation in RA patients.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibited reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.">

While αβ CAR-T therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in hematological malignancies, its efficacy in solid tumors remains constrained mainly by factors such as antigen heterogeneity, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and on-target/off-tumor toxicity. To overcome these limitations, emerging CAR platforms that utilize alternative immune effectors, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and γδ T lymphocytes, are rapidly gaining traction. This review systematically analyzes the mechanistic advantages of CAR-NK, CAR-M, and CAR-γδ T cell therapies, while critically evaluating persistent challenges in clinical translation, including limited cell persistence, manufacturing scalability, and dynamic immune evasion mechanisms. We further discuss innovative strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy through some viable strategies. By bridging fundamental immunology with translational engineering, this work provides a roadmap for developing CAR therapies capable of addressing the complexities of solid tumor eradication.">

        <tr id="Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression heavily relies on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In the ccRCC TME, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive a self-perpetuating cycle of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance through diverse interactions between cells and molecules. Furthermore, heterogeneous CAFs facilitate tumor growth through metabolic reprogramming and modulate immune suppression by driving the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which promote a multilayered immunosuppressive network. In addition, CAFs reshape the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), hinder the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and further exacerbate immune escape. Moreover, CAF-derived exosomes can confer resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by CAFs synergizes with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate adaptive resistance to targeted therapy. Emerging therapeutic strategies—including fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted CAR-T cells and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitors—can partially reverse this immunosuppressive property. Combination therapies employing immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF antagonists exhibit promising synergistic effects, although the clinical translation remains hampered by CAF heterogeneity, dual functional roles, and the lack of specific biomarkers. Future studies should integrate single-cell sequencing and spatial multi-omics techniques to comprehensively analyze the spatio-temporal dynamic heterogeneity of CAF subpopulations and develop precision treatment strategies based on molecular subtyping, aiming to break the vicious cycle of “CAF-TME-resistance” in ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant tumor and stands as the fourth leading contributor to cancer-related fatalities on a global scale. The specific link between CD2 Associated Protein (CD2AP) expression and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear, and further exploration is needed to understand its potential role in immune response and as a target for immunotherapy in GC. Utilizing RNA sequencing data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for a pan-cancer analysis, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out to determine the expression pattern and immunological involvement of CD2AP. Systematic association of CD2AP with immunological features within the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) TME was subsequently performed, encompassing factors like cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). We found that CD2AP was enhanced expression in the TME of a variety of malignancies. CD2AP contributes to forming a stromal reduced TME in GC and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. It was observed that patients with elevated levels of CD2AP, along with high scores on their CD4, CD20, and CD57 immune markers, tended to experience the most favorable prognosis. Furthermore, an IRS was constructed to accurately assess the prognosis of STAD patients. Since CD2AP was associated with the formation of stromal reduced TME in STAD, the expression of CD2AP can improve the effect of immunotherapy of STAD. CD2AP could emerge as a novel prognostic biomarker for STAD, offering a fresh avenue for molecular targeted therapy.

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Introduction The regulation of immune responses to promote tolerance to the fetus is critical for successful pregnancy. An understudied aspect of this process is the initiation of regulation pre-conception via exposure to semen. Our study aimed to understand how semen impacts recipient dendritic cells (DCs) and their subsequent role in shaping CD4 T cell differentiation. Methods Monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) were exposed to semen extracellular vesicles (SEV) or vesicle-depleted semen plasma (VDSP). Phenotypic and functional markers were analyzed using flow cytometry. We also exposed epithelial sheets from vaginal tissue to SEV and VDSP, and measured the number and marker expression of emigrating cells. Finally, we tested how SEV- or VDSP-exposed DCs altered CD4 T cell differentiation by co-culturing exposed MoDCs or tissue emigrated cells with autologous naïve CD4 T cells. Results MoDCs exhibited a significant increase of CD141, CD1a, CD38, and ILT4 expression when exposed to SEV or VDSP. A unique feature of semen-treated MoDCs was expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a potent contributor to the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). SEV but not VDSP significantly increased the emigration of intraepithelial DCs. Additionally, SEV significantly enhanced the expression of multiple immunoregulatory markers in the emigrated DCs. After co-culture, we observed significantly more FOXP3+ Tregs expressing high levels of TIGIT in the groups that were initially exposed to SEV. Discussion These findings indicate that exposure to SEV induces a tolerogenic program in DCs that can direct differentiation of a unique memory Treg subset, primed for expansion and presumably destined to support a successful pregnancy.">

Among the various therapeutic strategies available, cancer immunotherapy—encompassing adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy—has emerged as a particularly promising approach following surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and molecular targeted therapies. This form of treatment elicits substantial antigen-specific immune responses, enhances or restores anti-tumor immunity, thereby facilitating the control and destruction of tumor cells, and yielding durable responses across a range of cancers, which can lead to the eradication of tumor lesions and the prevention of recurrence. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a subset of ACT, are characterized by their heterogeneity and are found within tumor tissues, where they play a crucial role in mediating host antigen-specific immune responses against tumors.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse is associated with poor prognosis. While natural killer (NK) cell therapy can induce leukemia remission, infused NK cells are prone to exhaustion. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving NK cell exhaustion in AML patients could provide critical insights for developing novel strategies to optimize NK cell-based immunotherapies. In this study, we systematically investigated NK cell exhaustion in relapsed AML patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) through phenotypic assessments, functional assays, and RNA sequencing analyses. Compared to NK cells from complete remission patients and healthy controls, NK cells from relapsed AML patients exhibited an exhausted phenotype, marked by reduced maturity, elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, impaired cytotoxicity, and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Notably, NKG2A expression levels on NK cells correlated with disease progression. Blockade or genetic knockout of NKG2A effectively reversed NK cell exhaustion both in vitro and in an AML mouse model. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in exhausted NK cells. We found that excessive activation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis was associated with PI3K-AKT pathway inhibition, and blocking the NKG2A/HLA-E interaction or knocking out NKG2A restored AKT phosphorylation in exhausted NK cells. In summary, AML cells drive NK cell exhaustion through overactivation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Targeting the NKG2A/HLA-E axis represents a promising therapeutic approach to restore PI3K-AKT signaling and reverse NK cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="Background Few studies have focused on the development of multiple myeloma (MM)-specific immunotherapies. Tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD), triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns, may enhance MM-specific antitumor activity, offering a potential treatment strategy. Methods This study confirms that combining reactive oxygen species (ROS)-endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and pyroptosis-inducers (ROS-ERS inducer 1 (REI) and Quillaja saponaria fraction 21 (QS-21), respectively) activates specific anti-MM immunity. MM cell lines were treated with REI and QS-21 alone or in combination and cytotoxicity and apoptosis were examined. ICD markers were identified, including calreticulin, ATP, heat shock protein 70, and high mobility group box 1. Additionally, changes in mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, pyroptosis markers, and immune markers of dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T-cell activation were assessed both in vitro and in vivo. Results ROS-ERS combined with pyroptosis significantly induces MM cell apoptosis and enhances ICD marker activation. The combination treatment induces severe mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress, further promoting pyroptosis and MM-specific T-cell activation. In vivo, the combination treatment reduces tumor growth and improves DC and T-cell activation. Conclusions Thus, ROS-ERS inducers and pyroptosis inducers together significantly enhance the immunogenic response against MM, providing a promising strategy for MM treatment by activating powerful specific T-cell antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="CKLF (chemokine-like factor)-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family member 4 (CMTM4), belonging to the CMTM family of transmembrane domain proteins, plays a significant role in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Nevertheless, its involvement in tumor immunity remains elusive. In the present investigation, we observed an upregulation of CMTM4 expression in patients with cervical cancer (CC), which also serves as a prognostic indicator for patients with CC. In vitro experiments and therapeutic models have demonstrated that CMTM4 upregulates the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment via the CCL2 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 2)/CCR2 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 2) and IL-6 (interleukin-6)/GP130 (glycoprotein 130) axes. This process exerts immunosuppressive effects and promotes the occurrence and progression of CC. Mechanistically, CMTM4 interacts and stabilizes PHB2 (prohibitin 2) through post-translational modification, which further induces activation of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes)/TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1)/STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) pathway, facilitating the nuclear translocation of STAT6 which binds to the CCL2/IL-6 promoter, leading to the upregulation of CCL2/IL-6 transcription expression. Importantly, targeting CMTM4 with CMTM4-small interfering RNA enhanced the effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Our study identifies CMTM4 as a crucial determinant guiding the homing of MDSCs to CC, thereby contributing to MDSCs-mediated immune suppression and tumor progression. The combination of CMTM4 inhibition and anti-PD-1 treatment shows promising antitumor efficacy against CC. These findings offer novel insights into the tumor microenvironment and have the potential to inform the development of innovative immunotherapy approaches for CC.">

        <tr id="Introduction Prolonged viral infections often lead to lymphocyte exhaustion, marked by heightened inhibitory receptor expression like PD-1, compromising host defense mechanisms. The unexplored potential of chemical checkpoint inhibitors in rejuvenating immune responses prompted our investigation. Methods We focused on CCT007093, a Wip1 inhibitor, screened for its distinctive capacity to simultaneously decrease PD-1 and FcγRIIB expression in B cells. Results In this study, we harnessed a murine model of immune exhaustion induced by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection using hydrodynamic injection. Treatment with CCT007093 resulted in decreased levels of PD-1 expression, resulting in reduced percentages of PD-1+/hi CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in circulation, spleen, and liver. The expression levels of PD-1 and FcγRIIB, along with the percentages of PD-1+/hi and FcγRIIB+/hi CD19+ B cells in these tissues, were similarly diminished. Moreover, intrahepatic lymphocytes treated with CCT007093 displayed heightened responsiveness to ex vivo activation. Consequently, mice treated with CCT007093 exhibited significantly reduced serum HBsAg levels compared to vehicle-treated mice. Our detailed analyses, spanning promoter and transcriptome evaluations, uncovered p65 NF-κB as the primary activator of T cells and B cells, while Ying Yang 1 (YY1) emerged as the key regulator, orchestrating the down-regulation of PD-1 and FcγRIIB gene transcription in response to CCT007093. Discussion Our study highlights the prowess of chemical checkpoint inhibitors, exemplified by CCT007093, in alleviating immune exhaustion in HBV-infected mice, particularly by enhancing adaptive immunity.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to immunosuppression in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), leading to high aggressiveness and poor prognosis. However, the key molecules involved in shaping TAMs toward the pro-tumoral phenotype in CRLM remain unclear, limiting the development of macrophage-mediated immunotherapies for CRLM. Results In this study, we showed that DICER1 was highly expressed in TAMs and closely associated with M2 polarization in CRLM. Knockdown of Dicer, encoded by DICER1 in humans (or Dicer1 in mice), skewed macrophages toward an anti-tumoral M1 phenotype, with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tumor cell phagocytosis, thereby suppressing tumor growth in mice. An M2 macrophage-targeting nanosystem was developed to deliver Dicer1 siRNA for selectively downregulating Dicer expression in M2 macrophages. In situ manipulation of TAMs with the nanoparticle exerted a significant anti-tumor effect with an improved immune microenvironment in a CRLM mouse model. Macrophage depletion experiments further suggested that this effect was largely dependent on the presence of TAMs. Mechanistically, Dicer inhibition reprogrammed M2-like macrophages through downregulation of miR-148a-3p and miR-1981-5p. Conclusion Our study uncovered the central role of Dicer in the M2 polarization of TAMs, in turn suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for CRLM.

        <tr id="Microglia are resident innate immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that provides anti-microbial protection but also promote neuroinflammation. BRD4 is a chromatin reader that binds to acetylated histones and directs transcription of numerous genes. However, it is unknown whether and how BRD4 regulates microglia function. We addressed the role of microglia and BRD4 in a neuroinflammatory disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. It was reported earlier that in EAE, upon initial T cell activation in the peripheral lymphoid organs, CD4+ T cells migrate to CNS and are reactivated by resident or migratory antigen presenting cells resulting in full manifestation of EAE (Rossi and Constantin, Front Immunol 7:506, 2016), (Plastini et al., Front Cell Neurosci 14:269, 2020). Using conditional deletion of Brd4 in CD4 T cells, we reveal that BRD4 regulates T helper cell differentiation and promotes T cell migration to CNS resulting in EAE. It remained unclear whether resident microglia are capable of reactivating migrating T cells to the CNS and if BRD4 plays a role in the process. To determine the role of microglial BRD4 in EAE, we constructed conditional knockout mice lacking Brd4 (Brd4cKO) in microglia. RNA-seq analysis showed that Brd4 deletion led to the downregulation of many microglia genes in both naive and EAE conditions. Consequently, Brd4cKO mice had markedly reduced EAE pathology, namely reduced paralysis, absence of axonal demyelination and inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines. In vehicle treated mice (vehicle) abundant number of T cells were found to be near microglia that may lead to T cell- microglia interaction and T cell reactivation. In contrast, the number of T cells detected in the CNS of Brd4cKO mice was much fewer. This may lead to reduced T cell- microglia interaction, failure of T cells to get reactivated and hence failed to achieve full manifestation of EAE. These results demonstrate that microglia are critically involved in EAE disease progression for which BRD4 is essential. In summary, BRD4 directs transcription of genes defining microglia function. By so doing BRD4 promotes demyelination and neuroinflammation to exacerbate EAE.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy targeting the programmed death ligand-1/programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-L1/PD-1) pathway exhibits limited effectiveness in individuals with recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Recent studies have noted that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment (TME) triggers intricate interplay, termed “hypoxia-induced exosome-mediated communication”, between cancer cells and various immune cells. However, the role of hypoxia in modulating the immunosuppressive environment and its implications on the efficacy of immunotherapy in NPC remains poorly understood. In this study, we found hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) was positively associated with increased PD-L1 levels and decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and correlated with a poor prognosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that hypoxia regulated the expression of PD-L1 in NPC cells and their exosomes by activating the binding of HIF-1α to the PD-L1 promoter. Meanwhile, using in vitro approaches, we found that macrophages could upregulate their PD-L1 expression through the phagocytosis of exosomal PD-L1 derived from NPC cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that PD-L1+ macrophages could induce CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reduce their proliferation. In conclusion, our study revealed that hypoxia (via HIF-1α) upregulated the expression of PD-L1 in exosomes derived from NPC cells, while macrophages induce the suppression of CD8+ T cells by phagocytosis of exosomal PD-L1. Targeting the PD-L1+ macrophages could potentially serve as a promising approach to augment the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade in NPC.

 Background:
 The liver is a frequent site of metastasis and carries a poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients with liver metastases (LM) derive limited benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), due to hepatic myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) mediated T cell elimination. Here, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to perform single cell, highly multiplexed, analysis of LM and primary lung tumors to investigate how vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) influences T cell depletion within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of LM.
 Methods:
 We comprehensively characterizedthe TIME in LM and primary lung tumors in 21 patients with NSCLC or SCLC using IMC. A panel of 40 antibodies was assembled to interrogate immune subsets and VEGF pathway markers. Each antibody was conjugated to a unique metal isotope. After validation, the antibody cocktail was used to stain the biopsies. Tissue images were segmented using Mesmer, and hierarchical clustering was applied to single-cell expression data to identify phenotypes. Similar clustering of cell neighbor profiles was applied to obtain spatial motifs. Phenotypic and motif frequencies, together with functional expression across phenotypes, were compiled from all samples and compared across conditions.
 Results:
 Initial visualization of the raw, unsegmented data revealed higher infiltration of CD8
 +
 and CD4
 +
 T cells in LM compared to the lung TIME. After segmentation, marker expression heatmaps uncovered complex cell-cell interaction ecosystems. The liver samples were enriched with M2 macrophages (CD163
 +
 ), MDSC (CD11b
 +
 ), and proliferative endothelial cells (CD105
 +
 ) whereas the lung samples were enriched in tumor cells (TTF1
 +
 for NSCLC and INSM1
 +
 /synaptophysin
 +
 for SCLC) and T cells (CD4
 +
 , CD8
 +
 ). Spatial neighborhood profiling of NSCLC liver tissues identified 12 neighborhood types, showing a general trend of mutual exclusivity between MDSCs and CD4
 +
 /CD8
 +
 T cells across neighborhoods. Notably, CD8
 +
 T cells in MDSC-enriched neighborhoods exhibited consistently higher FAS expression, a key apoptotic marker. Heterogenous FAS and VEGF signaling across neighborhoods suggested a mixed immune-suppressive and vascularized response in the liver TIME, supporting VEGF’s role in mediating MDSC-driven hepatic CD8
 +
 T cell depletion in patients with LM.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings highlight significant differences in the TIME between LM and primary lung tumors, with LM demonstrating a more immunosuppressive and VEGF-enriched milieu. The spatial association of MDSCs with CD8
 +
 T cells, along with elevated FAS expression and VEGF signaling suggests a mechanistic role for VEGF in driving immune evasion within liver tumors. These results underscore the potential of VEGF blockade as a therapeutic strategy to overcome T cell suppression and improve ICI efficacy in patients with lung cancer metastatic to liver (NCT05588388, PI Sankar).

This study aims to construct a novel risk model for AML patient through comprehensive analysis of scRNA and bulk RNA data to optimize the precise treatment strategies for patients and improve prognosis. Methods and Results scRNA-seq classified cells into nine clusters, including Bcells, erythrocyte, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC/Prog), monocyte/macrophagocyte (Mono/Macro), myelocyte, neutrophils, plasma, and T/NK cells. Functional analysis demonstrated the important role of inflammation immune response in the pathogenesis of AML, and the leukocyte transendothelial migration and adhesion in the process of inflammation should be noticed. ssGSEA method identified four core cells including GMP, HSC/Prog, Mono/Macro, and myelocyte for subsequent analysis, which contains 1,594 marker genes. Furthermore, we identified AML-associated genes (2,067genes) and DEGs (1,010genes) between AML patients and controls usingGSE114868dataset. After performing intersection, univariate Cox, and LASSO analysis, we obtained a prognostic model based on the expression levels of five signature genes, namely, CALR, KDM1A, SUCNR1, TMEM220, and ADM. The prognostic model was then validated by two external datasets. Patients with high-risk scores are predisposed to experience poor overall survival. Further GSEA analysis of risk-model-related genes revealed the significant differences in inflammatory response between high-and low-risk groups.

        <tr id="Background CD169+ macrophages in lymph nodes (LNs) activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which play a crucial role in anticancer immunity, through antigen presentation and co-stimulation by CD169. Interferon alpha (IFNα) is capable of inducing the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages; however, its clinical applications have been hindered by pharmacokinetic limitations—low LN distribution and an inability to target macrophages. To overcome these issues, this study genetically fused mouse IFNα (mIFNα) with mannosylated mouse serum albumin (Man-MSA), and investigated the antitumor effects of the hybrid protein (Man-MSA-mIFNα) or its add-on effects with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade. Methods To confirm the possibility of CD169+ macrophage-mediated T cell priming, positional information about individual immune cells in LNs of cancer patients was obtained. Traits of Man-MSA-mIFNα, which was prepared using Pichia pastoris to form the high-mannose structure, were characterized by several physicochemical methods. To evaluate the lymphatic drainage of Man-MSA-mIFNα, radioiodine or Cy5-labeled Man-MSA-mIFNα was subcutaneously administered in mice, and then the radioactivity or fluorescence in LNs was analyzed. CD169-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (CD169-DTR) mice in which LN CD169+ macrophages can be depleted by DT injection were used to verify whether the antitumor effect of Man-MSA-mIFNα is dependent on LN CD169+ macrophages. Results Multiplex tissue imaging predicted close proximity of CD169+ macrophages and T cells and positive correlation between the number of CD169+ macrophages and T cells in neighborhoods in LNs of cancer patients. Physicochemical analyses showed that Man-MSA-mIFNα was formed from the fusion of the intact Man-MSA and mIFNα. Man-MSA-mIFNα efficiently induced the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages by its high LN distribution and macrophage-targeting capability, and significantly exerted antitumor activity through CD8+ T cell activation in the LNs, whereas its antitumor effects were canceled in CD169-DTR mice. Finally, combination therapy with PD-L1 blockade markedly suppressed tumor growth in MB49-bearing mice, which exhibit resistance to PD-L1 blockade monotherapy. Conclusions The present study successfully designed and developed Man-MSA-mIFNα, which efficiently induces the CD169+ phenotype in LN macrophages, contributing to the antitumor immunity. The findings suggest that our novel strategy targeting CD169⁺ macrophages could be a promising immunotherapy for cancer patients who are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

        <tr id="Abstract The small intestine is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption, immune regulation, and microbial balance. Its epithelial lining, containing specialized cells like Paneth cells and tuft cells, is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Paneth cells produce antimicrobial peptides and growth factors that support microbial regulation and intestinal stem cells, while tuft cells act as chemosensors, detecting environmental changes and modulating immune responses. Along with immune cells such as intraepithelial lymphocytes, innate lymphoid cells, T cells, and macrophages, they form a strong defense system that protects the epithelial barrier. Disruptions in this balance contribute to chronic inflammation, microbial dysbiosis, and compromised barrier function—key features of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, dysfunctions in the small intestine and immune cells are linked to systemic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. Recent research highlights promising therapeutic strategies, including modulation of epithelial and immune cell functions, probiotics, and gene editing to restore gut health and address systemic effects. This review emphasizes the pivotal roles of small intestinal epithelia and immune cells in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, their involvement in disease development, and emerging treatments for intestinal and systemic disorders.">

        <tr id="Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TDEVs) represent a heterogeneous population of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, which are essential for tumor growth. EVs function as natural carriers of bioactive molecules, including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, enabling them to influence and regulate complex cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TDEVs mainly have immunosuppressive functions as a result of the inhibitory signals disrupting the immune cell anti-tumor activity. They enhance tumor progression and immune evasion by inhibiting the effector function of immune cells and by altering critical processes of immune cell recruitment, polarization, and functional suppression by different signaling pathways. In this sense, TDEVs modulate the NF-κB pathway, promoting inflammation and inducing immune evasion. The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling is required for TDEV-mediated immune suppression and the manifestation of tumor-supporting features. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, necessary for metabolic reprogramming, is orchestrated by TDEV to abrogate immune response and drive cancer cell proliferation. Finally, exosomal cargo can modulate the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, activating pro-inflammatory responses that influence tumor development and immunomodulation. In this review, we take a deep dive into how TDEVs affect the immune cells by altering key signaling pathways. We also examine emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at disrupting EV-mediated pathways, offering promising avenues for the development of novel EV-based cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute rejection is a critical complication after liver transplantation, contributing significantly to transplant dysfunction and recipient mortality. Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a zinc-finger transcription factor, has an undefined role in liver allograft acute rejection, despite its broad expression and regulatory potential in immune responses. Methods To investigate YY1's role, we used an MHC Class II-mismatched rat liver transplantation model. Allografts were harvested on post-transplant days 5 and 10 for YY1 expression analysis in inflammatory cells around recipient liver central veins. In vitro, dendritic cells (DCs) were transfected to overexpress YY1, and their surface markers (CD80, CD86, MHC II) and cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6) were assessed. Naïve CD4+ T cells were co-cultured with YY1-overexpressing DCs to evaluate their polarization towards inflammatory phenotypes (IL-17, IFN-γ production). Results YY1 expression was elevated in inflammatory cells of allografts on days 5 and 10 post-transplant, correlating with increased serum transaminases and inflammatory cytokines. YY1-overexpressing DCs showed heightened expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC II, along with augmented TNF-α and IL-6 production. These YY1-activated DCs drove naïve CD4+ T cells to produce higher levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ, indicating polarization towards a proinflammatory Th17/Th1 phenotype. Discussion YY1 promotes DC activation and naïve T cell polarization towards inflammatory phenotypes, thereby contributing to acute rejection in liver transplantation. Targeting YY1 may offer a therapeutic strategy to mitigate acute rejection and improve transplant outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore YY1's regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential in liver transplantation.">

        <tr id="Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that expand aberrantly in cancer and exhibit potent immunosuppressive properties. They contribute to tumor progression through both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Immunologically, MDSCs suppress antitumor responses by inhibiting effector cells such as T cells and NK cells, facilitating immune evasion. Nonimmunologically, they promote tumor growth and metastasis through processes such as the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. MDSC accumulation is closely linked to accelerated tumor progression, including resistance to both immunotherapies and conventional treatments, making these cells critical therapeutic targets. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MDSC‐targeted strategies to improve treatment efficacy. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and effectiveness in MDSC‐targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the origin, classification, and biological characteristics of MDSCs, their dual roles in tumor progression, and their clinical significance. We also discuss recent advances in clinical and preclinical studies, including both traditional targeted therapies and emerging innovative strategies. By integrating current findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of MDSCs in cancer and valuable insights for advancing cancer treatment and drug development.">

The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression.

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-(L)1 pathways have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since last decade. However, the efficacy is still limited because the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts ICI-primed T cell immunity. Therefore, it is quite crucial to block the potential mechanisms in inducing immunosuppression to improve ICI efficacy. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 5 is an important immunosuppressive molecule expressed in a wide range of myeloid cells and predicts tumor progression. Our group was the first to report ILT5 expression in solid tumor cells (colorectal cancer). However, the expression and function of ILT5 in NSCLC are still unknown.
 Methods:
 ILT5 expression in NSCLC tissues and tumor cell lines was determined by PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of tumor-derived ILT5 on T-cell phenotypes and functions was evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. ILT5-regulated downstream signals and molecules were determined by RNA sequencing, PCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry. Tumor transplantation and immunotherapeutic models were established in C57/BL6 and NSG mice to explore the effect of ILT5 on tumor progression and the synergies of ILT5 blockade with ICIs.
 Results:
 ILT5 is highly expressed in NSCLC cells, predicting poor patient survival. ILT5 induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion rather than senescence and apoptosis in the TME. Mechanistically, ILT5 upregulated PD-L1 through the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn increased PD-1 expression in CD8
 +
 T cells and induced their exhaustion. PIR-B (ILT5 orthlog in mice) overexpression in mice induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion and tumor growth in vivo, while PIR-B knockdown had the opposite effect. More importantly, inhibition of ILT5 synergistically enhanced the tumoricidal effect of PD-1 inhibitor in NSCLC immunotherapeutic models.
 Conclusions:
 Enriched ILT5 expression in NSCLC cells induces CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion via activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR-PD-L1 pathway. ILT5 inhibition synergistically enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor. Our findings identifies a novel mechanism for tumor immunosuppression and develops a promising strategy for improving ICI efficacy.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of auto-reactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ anti-neural T cells in the irreversible neurodegeneration that underlies progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell-mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer-based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell-mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Numerous studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which can be taken up by neighboring cells or transported to distant sites via bodily fluids, thereby facilitating intercellular communication and regulating multiple cellular functions. Within the tumor microenvironment, EV-ncRNA, on the one hand, regulate the expression of PD-L1, thereby influencing tumor immune evasion, promoting tumor cell proliferation, and enhancing tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis in vivo. On the other hand, these specific EV-ncRNAs can also modulate the functions of immune cells (such as CD8 + T cells, macrophages, and NK cells) through various molecular mechanisms, inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment and promoting resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, delving into the molecular mechanisms underlying EV-ncRNA regulation of immune checkpoints presents compelling therapeutic prospects for strategies that selectively target EV-ncRNAs. In this review, we elaborate on the cutting-edge research progress related to EV-ncRNAs in the context of cancer and dissect their pivotal roles in the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway. We also highlight the promising clinical applications of EV-ncRNAs in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, bridging basic research with practical clinical applications. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) derived extracellular vesicles represent a promising vehicle for the activation of adaptive immunity, demonstrating significant potential in the development of cancer nanovaccines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of a functional DCs-derived extracellular vesicles in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Methods A pre-modification strategy was employed to overexpress XCL1 in dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. In vitro experiments, prostate cancer-bearing mouse models, and OVA-expressing prostate cancer mouse models demonstrated that dendritic cells efficiently internalize extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells (DEXXCL1), thereby enhancing the chemotaxis, activation, and antigen-presenting capacity of cDC1 cells. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, this approach significantly increased the number and cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells, improved the tumor microenvironment, and effectively suppressed prostate cancer tumor growth. Results The coding sequence of XCL1 successfully inserted upstream of the PDGFR transmembrane domain and transfected into dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. Extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells not only exhibited high XCL1 expression, but were also enriched with chemokine receptor CCR7 and MHC I molecules on their surface. This nanovaccines enhanced the uptake of extracellular vesicles by dendritic cells, recruited cDC1 cells within the tumor tissue, and significantly improved their antigen-presenting capacity. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, which generates a large amount of tumor-associated antigen STEAP1, this strategy effectively enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells. Moreover, it reduced the proportion of regulatory T cells and immunosuppressive factors, thereby reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach effectively inhibited tumor growth in mice and prolonged their survival. These findings demonstrate the strong synergistic effects of the nanovaccines and cisplatin in promoting antitumor immunity. Conclusions A novel nanovaccines induces potent antitumor immune responses and, in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, effectively remodels the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach offers a new strategy and preclinical evidence for the immunotherapy of “cold tumors” prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) disorders characterized by cytopenia, ineffective hematopoiesis, as well as the potential to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pathogenesis of MDS is influenced by intrinsic factors, such as genetic insults, and extrinsic factors, including altered bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) composition and architecture. BMM is reprogrammed in MDS, initially to prevent the development of the disease but eventually to provide a survival advantage to dysplastic cells. Recently, inflammation or age-related inflammation in the bone marrow has been identified as a key pathogenic mechanism for MDS. Inflammatory signals trigger stress hematopoiesis, causing HSPCs to emerge from quiescence and resulting in MDS development. A better understanding of the role of the BMM in the pathogenesis of MDS has opened up new avenues for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge regarding the significance of the BMM to MDS pathophysiology and highlights recent advances in developing innovative therapies.">

Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is the cornerstone for liver fibrosis and influenced by multiple factors, such as viral infection, hepatocellular injury, chronic immune activation, gut mucosal barrier dysfunction, and microbial translocation. Unlike gram-negative bacterial products, the impact of gram-positive microbial products in Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) associated liver inflammation and fibrosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major gram-positive bacterial component, on HSCs in the context of HIV-1 infection. Methods Human HSCs were isolated from the livers of both non-HIV and HIV-infected patients undergoing hepatic resection. The inflammatory responses of HSCs to LTA stimulation were measured by ELISA before or after HIV-1BaL ex vivo expision. Western blotting, ChIP-qPCR and RNA-seq were used to reveal the mechanisms contributing to the IL-8 response to LTA stimulation and HIV-1BaL exposure in HSCs. Results While LTA stimulation modestly increased IL-8 production in HSCs, this effect was significantly amplified in HIV-1-infected HSCs. Elevated IL-8 levels were detected in HIV-1+ liver sections, and IL-8 treatment of cultured HSCs significantly increased α-SMA and COL1A1 expression, supporting IL-8 as a key inflammatory driver of liver fibrosis in HIV-1+ individuals. Transcriptomic analyses implicated histone acetylation as a regulator of the enhanced IL-8 response of HSCs to LTA in HIV-1 infection. Consistent with this, treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, further increased the IL-8 response in HIV-1-infected HSCs. ChIP-qPCR confirmed that histone H4K5 acetylation facilitated IL-8 promoter transactivation, rendering HIV-1-infected cells more responsive to LTA. Conclusions HIV-1 infection sensitizes HSCs to LTA stimulation, leading to an amplified IL-8 response mediated through histone acetylation that may accelerate liver fibrosis progression in PLWH. As microbial translocation persists despite effective antiretroviral therapy, these findings underscore the need for targeted strategies to mitigate liver fibrosis in HIV-1 infected HIV-1+ individuals.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling durable responses. However, most patients showed resistance and limited efficacy. Elucidating mechanisms of resistance is imperative to extend the clinical utility of ICBs. Emerging evidence highlights cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), particularly TGFβ-activated myofibroblastic CAFs, as key orchestrators of immunosuppressive TMEs and ICBs resistance. These CAFs drive T-cell exclusion preventing intratumoral T cells from engaging cancer cells. This review explores the role of TGFβ signaling in CAFs in driving immune evasion and therapy resistance. While targeting TGFβ or CAFs directly has shown limited inconsistent results, downstream molecules in TGFβ-activated CAFs, including induced TGFβ (βig-h3), endocytic receptor 180 (Endo180), leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15), and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), emerge as promising therapeutic targets to counteract T-cell exclusion and restore immunotherapy sensitivity. Advancing research on CAF heterogeneity and pro-tumorigenic subsets may uncover innovative strategies to expand immunotherapy benefits.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The thymus exhibits constitutive activation of nearly all major inflammatory pathways, including sterile MyD88‐dependent signaling and interferon production by mTECs, the presence of cellular and molecular components of type 1, type 2, and type 3 responses, as well as sustained B cell activation. The reasons for the existence of such a complex constitutively active inflammatory network at the site of T cell development—where the initial pathogen encounter is unlikely—have remained enigmatic. We propose that this inflammatory thymic ‘ecosystem’ has evolved to promote immunological tolerance to ‘inflammatory self’—endogenous molecules absent from most peripheral tissues at steady state but upregulated during pathogen invasion. The spatial and temporal overlap with pathogen presence makes the discrimination of the inflammatory self from pathogen‐derived molecules a unique challenge for the adaptive immune system. The frequent occurrence of diseases associated with autoantibodies against proinflammatory cytokines underscores the persistent risk of these molecules being misidentified as foreign. Their abundant representation in the thymus, therefore, is likely to be critical for maintaining tolerance. This review explores current insights into the thymic inflammatory network, its cellular and molecular constituents, and their role in the induction of T cell tolerance.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation offers a cure for a variety of blood disorders, predominantly affecting the elderly; however, its application, especially in this demographic, is limited by treatment toxicity. In response, we employ a murine transplantation model based on low-intensity conditioning protocols using antibody-mediated HSC depletion. While aging presents a significant barrier to effective HSC engraftment, optimizing HSC doses and non-genotoxic targeting methods greatly enhance the long-term multilineage activity of the transplanted cells. We demonstrate that young HSCs, once effectively engrafted in aged hosts, improve hematopoietic output and ameliorate age-compromised lymphopoiesis. This culminated in a strategy that robustly mitigates disease progression in a genetic model of myelodysplastic syndrome. These results suggest that non-genotoxic HSC transplantation could fundamentally change the clinical management of age-associated hematological disorders, offering a prophylactic tool to delay or even prevent their onset in elderly patients.">

Conversely, MSCs also demonstrate potential inhibitory effects on AML, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and the modulation of immune responses. These contrasting effects highlight the complexities of MSC-AML interactions and emphasize the need for further research to understand their therapeutic potential fully. Targeting MSCs represents a promising avenue for AML treatment. Strategies aimed at modifying MSC-mediated support of AML cells, such as inhibiting pro-survival signaling pathways, disrupting the leukemia-supportive niche, and enhancing the immune-stimulatory functions of MSCs, could offer novel therapeutic approaches. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of current research. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the dual effects of MSCs in AML, to identify biomarkers that predict patient response to MSC-targeted therapies, and to develop strategies to overcome potential challenges associated with MSC-based interventions. In conclusion, understanding the multifaceted role of MSCs in AML pathogenesis is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. By harnessing the potential of MSCs and targeting their interactions with AML cells, we can explore novel strategies to improve treatment outcomes and enhance the overall management of this challenging hematological malignancy.

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is a biologically heterogeneous malignancy of clonal plasma cells, often progressing from MGUS or smoldering MM. It causes anemia, bone lesions, and immune dysfunction due to abnormal plasma cell expansion in the bone marrow. Neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors may influence MM progression by affecting immune cells and the bone marrow niche. Growing evidence points to a role for neuroimmune regulation in tumor immunity. Despite therapeutic progress, disease heterogeneity and resistance highlight the need for new strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment and neuroimmune axis. Methods This investigation exploited single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze MM and high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMMh) samples, identifying 11 distinct cell types. We examined their transcriptional signatures, stemness, proliferative properties, and metabolic pathways, with particular attention to neuroimmune interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Using trajectory inference tools such as CytoTRACE, Monocle2, and Slingshot, we traced the differentiation paths of MM cell subpopulations and identified key signaling pathways that may influence immune responses and tumor progression. Results The analysis identified four distinct subpopulations of myeloma cells, with the C0 IGLC3+ myeloma cells representing the least differentiated and most proliferative subset. These cells played a critical role in MM progression and may contribute to immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, receptor-ligand interactions within the tumor microenvironment were identified, which may be influenced by neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors. These findings suggest that the nervous system and immune modulation significantly affect tumor biology, highlighting potential therapeutic targets that could be exploited to overcome resistance to conventional therapies. Conclusion This single-cell analysis provided new insights into the cellular diversity and differentiation trajectories in MM, offering a deeper understanding of the complex neuroimmune interactions that drive tumor progression and resistance. By incorporating the role of neuroinflammation and immune modulation, our study suggested novel therapeutic strategies targeting the neuroimmune axis in oncology, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective, personalized treatment approaches for MM.">

Immune checkpoint can be expressed on the surface of NK cells and meticulously regulates their activation states and effector functions through complex signaling networks. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy strategies focusing on NK cell immune checkpoints have demonstrated remarkable advancements. This review systematically elucidates the expression profiles, signaling pathways, and the immune checkpoint molecule regulatory mechanisms localized on the NK cell membrane (e.g., NKG2A, KIRs, and TIGIT) or intracellularly (e.g., BIM, Cbl-b, and EZH2) during tumor immune evasion. Particular attention is devoted to dissecting the regulatory mechanisms through which these immune checkpoint molecules influence NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, proliferative capacity, and tunable modulation of NK cell immune checkpoint expression by diverse factors within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, this review comprehensively summarizes preclinical advancements in NK cell immune checkpoint blockade strategies, including single checkpoint blockade, combinatorial checkpoint approaches, and their integration with conventional therapeutic modalities. Additionally, emerging therapeutic advancements, such as gene-editing technologies and chimeric antigen receptor-NK (CAR-NK) cell therapy, are evaluated for their prospective applications in immunotherapy based on NK cells. By thoroughly elucidating the molecular regulatory networks underlying NK cell immune checkpoints and their mechanisms of action within the complex tumor microenvironment, this review aims to provide critical theoretical insights and translational foundations to foster the development of innovative tumor immunotherapy strategies, improvement of combination therapies, and realization of personalized precision medicine.">

Our data reveal that myeloid-specific Mac-1 significantly increases EAE severity and hinders disease regression. Loss of Mac-1 increases Gr-1+ cells in peripheral tissues and the CNS and preferably accelerates the transition of Ly6Chi monocytes from a pro-inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in a disease stage–dependent manner.

        <tr id="Background Regulatory B cell (Breg), known for its immunosuppressive properties through the provision of IL-10, plays a critical role in the control of inflammatory diseases. Although Breg has been discovered for over two decades in mammals, its existence in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the differentiation mechanism and functional profiles of teleost CD25L+ Breg to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Breg. Methods Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, qPCR, morphological analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, recombinant IL-35 stimulation, cell co-culture in Transwell system were performed to reveal the phenotypic features, differentiation mechanism and suppressive functions of teleost CD25L+ Breg. To elucidate the immunoregulatory role of CD25L+ Breg in vivo, bacterial infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models were established in teleost fish. Systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements. Results Phenotypically, we identified a unique IgM+CD25L+ B cell subset, termed CD25L+ B cells, characterized by their capacity to produce IL-10 and IL-12p35 in a cold-blooded vertebrate, the grass carp. Mechanistically, IL-35 stimulation induced the differentiation of CD25L− B cells into CD25L+ B cells, promoting the production of IL-35 and IL-10 via STAT3 activation. Functionally, teleost CD25L+ B cells served as a conventional Breg subtype that exerted its immunosuppressive functions on effector T cells and neutrophils via cell contact or cytokine delivery. Upon bacterial infection, CD25L+ Breg increased earlier than CD25L+ Treg and produced IL-10. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model, Breg frequency and IL-10 levels increased significantly during IBD remission, and Breg adoptive transfer could prevent IBD development and contribute to intestinal tissue repair. Conclusions These novel findings reveal that fish have evolved Breg with specialized anti-inflammatory functions, providing evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic origin and functional conservation of Breg from fish to mammals.

        <tr id="T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, also known as signal 1, plays a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The question of whether TCR signaling exerts a deterministic role in T cell fate determination is an area of active investigation. It has been particularly challenging to address this question due to the complexities associated with genetic manipulation of TCR signaling components, which often disrupts thymic T cell development or impairs T cell activation upon TCR engagement. Recent study demonstrates that the TCR-Lck/Fyn axis directly induces STAT3 phosphorylation and synergizes with pro-inflammatory cytokines to optimize STAT3 phosphorylation during Th17 cell differentiation. Additionally, the TCR-Lck/Fyn-AKT/mTOR axis negatively regulates Treg cell differentiation. In CD8+ T cells, persistent high-affinity antigen stimulation drives differentiation along the exhaustion pathway, while acute infection or intermediate antigen levels promote differentiation into effector and memory T cells, although the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. Collectively, these studies provide compelling evidence that TCR signaling has a deterministic impact on T cell fate.

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer. It remains incurable, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated a panel of peptides derived from a functional motif of Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family 1 (SLAMF1) with single amino acid substitutions and found that several of them exhibited potent anti-cancer activity by inducing MM cell death. The most potent peptide P7N4 significantly reduced the viability of both IL-6-dependent and -independent human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), proteasome inhibitor-resistant MM cells, and primary MM cells, while exerting minimal effects on healthy blood cells. Furthermore, P7N4 enhanced the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan. When combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, P7N4 potentiated the anti-cancer effect of bortezomib in a highly aggressive murine MM model. Mechanistically, P7N4 induced apoptosis in MM cells by disrupting key pro-survival pathways, leading to reduction in IRF4, MYC, and β-catenin levels, as well as inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in peptide-sensitive HMCL, P7N4 significantly altered the expression of IRF4-associated genes. These effects were likely mediated by direct interaction of peptide with IRF4, targeting this transcription factor for degradation. Overall, our findings established P7N4 as a promising therapeutic candidate for MM, warranting further optimization and in-depth mechanistic studies.">

Loss of B cells increased populations of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung and these CD8+ T cells were transcriptionally and functionally distinct from WT mice. Use of antibody-deficient mouse models showed that this phenotype was specifically due to loss of antibody production from B cells. Passive immunization with influenza-antibody serum in B cell deficient mice rescued the CD8+ T cell phenotype. CD8+ T cell depletion and lethal super-infection challenge experiments showed that the cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells from B cell deficient mice protect against super-infection bacterial burden and mortality. These findings provide insight into the importance of B cells for regulating immune responses against infection.">

        <tr id="The presence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) characterized by an M2-like phenotype sustains a robust immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) progression. Here, we find that genetic deletion of cyclophilin J (CYPJ) in mice significantly accelerates the development of liver cancer. Analysis of immune cell infiltration reveals that high expression of CYPJ correlates with an increased proportion of M1-polarized, anti-tumor macrophages and CD8+ T cells in the TME. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CYPJ interacts with AKT1 and inhibits the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which leads to polarization of TAMs toward the anti-tumor M1 phenotype, resulting in a tumor-suppressive effect. Collectively, our findings implicate CYPJ as a novel potential therapeutic target for macrophage-mediated therapy in liver cancer.">

        <tr id="Introduction The H9N2 avian influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans. Methods This study investigated the effects of baicalin, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection. In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells, and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection. Results Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, helping to counteract the virus’s suppression of these defense proteins. In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier, baicalin has both antiviral and immune-regulating effects: it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2-infected mice. Most importantly, baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced. These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways (Mx1 and PKR) and restoring adaptive immune balance (CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio). Discussion These dual protective effects highlight baicalin’s potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine-resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2, contributing valuable insights into plant-derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of the tumor-immune ecosystem is crucial for advancing neoadjuvant strategies in cancer treatment. This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty patients underwent combination therapy. Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment. Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles. Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed. Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45+ cells and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) scores were observed in the hypo- and lymphoid-inflamed groups, whereas the myeloid-inflamed group showed minimal changes. After treatment, increased calreticulin expression in tumor cells, together with increased lymphoid cell lineages, was observed in non-recurrent cases. The myeloid-inflamed group exhibited higher expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2, suggesting the presence of a hypoxic and metastasis-promoting environment. Spatial analysis revealed that responders had a high infiltration of T cells within tumor cell nests, whereas non-responders had fewer T cells, with β-catenin expression in cancer cells. Upregulated lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the myeloid-inflammation group, and PD-L1 dynamics suggest potential targets for further therapy. These findings highlight the need for targeted neoadjuvant strategies based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vehicles (EVs) are reported to be involved in several processes relating to tumor progression, including angiogenesis, osteolysis, and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). However, the role of EVs in the immune-suppressive milieu of MM is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of MM-derived EVs on T cells, focusing on markers of T cell exhaustion. Using activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, we observed immunosuppressive effects such as upregulated expression of immune checkpoint markers on CD8+ T cells treated with MM-derived EVs. Proteomic analysis identified several proteins, such as IL-8, SLC1A5, PIN2, and FSP1, associated with regulation of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammation. Surprisingly, sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) was enriched in MM cell line-derived EVs, implicating SPHK1/S1P signaling in the immunosuppressive effect of MM EVs. Thus, MM-derived EVs may promote T cell exhaustion via upregulating the expression of immune checkpoint markers and thereby contribute to the formation of the immune-suppressive milieu of MM, resulting in impaired T cell activity.">

Here, we analyzed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from skeletal muscle of IBM, other myositis, and control patients to identify and quantify these mDC subsets and characterize their contribution to IBM inflammation. Our findings reveal that all three mDC subsets are relatively increased and activated in muscle of IBM patients and correlate with IBM-specific inflammatory markers.

 Background:
 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is typically reversible in CAR-T therapy, while hyperinflammatory syndromes like macrophage activation-like syndrome (MAS-L) and high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early interventions are critical for improving outcomes. We aim to analyze clinical cytokine assays and cellular phenotypes early in hyperinflammatory syndromes to identify profiles for severe cases to inform management decisions.
 Methods:
 This study included 113 CAR-T patients (pt) (September 2019-March 2024) with cytokine profiles (CP) performed at the second tocilizumab dose or with suspected hyperinflammatory states (CP1), followed by assessments at 24 hours (CP24) and 48 hours (CP48). 52 pts consented to blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cell immune phenotyping at pre-treatment (pre-LD) and day 1 for PB.
 Results:
 Among the 113 pts, CRS pts (N=74), when compared to MAS-L(N=19) & IEC-HS (N=20) at CP1, had lower levels of TNF (median in pg/mL; 31, 62.9, 47.7) , IL-18 (794, 1353, 2011), and MCP-1 (689, 2722, 2485.5). While MAS-L and IEC-HS had similar CP1 profiles, CP24 and CP48 differed between them: TNF & MCP-1 levels decreased in MAS-L but remained elevated or increased in IEC-HS. IL-18 was stable in MAS-L but increased steadily daily in IEC-HS. Infections were more frequent in IEC-HS (CRS: 43%; MAS-L: 58%; IEC-HS: 85%; p=0.002). Notably, patients who died with persistent
 E. faecium
 bacteremia had higher IL-18 in CP48. In the 52 pts with cell phenotypes available by flow, 33 had CRS, 18 MAS-L and 8 IEC-HS. The correlation between cell phenotypes and cytokine levels showed that elevated TNF at CP1 correlated with increased non-classical monocytes in pre-LD BM and higher NK and NK-T cells in pre-LD PB. Similarly, elevated IL-18 CP48 levels correlated with increased CD8 T-cells, NK-T cells, and intermediate monocytes in pre-LD PB, as well as increased NK cells at both pre-LD and day 1 (Table).
 Conclusions:
 We report distinct cytokine profiles in IEC-HS early in the inflammatory course post-CAR-T therapy. These elevated cytokines correlate with specific immune cell subsets, including BM-resident monocytes, intermediate monocytes with heightened cytokine trafficking and inflammatory capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility for identifying potential biomarkers for early risk stratification and targeted interventions.

        <tr id="Innate immune memory (trained immunity) refers to the ability of innate immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, to retain a long-term imprint of a prior stimulus through epigenetic and metabolic adaptations, enabling amplified responses upon restimulation. Recent studies have classified innate immune memory into central and peripheral types. Central innate immune memory originates in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the bone marrow, where epigenetic reprogramming generates a sustained inflammatory bias, contributing to chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and stroke. Peripheral innate immune memory occurs in monocytes or macrophages that acquire heightened responsiveness after repeated exposure to stimuli in peripheral tissues. This review explores the mechanisms underlying both central and peripheral innate immune memory, their roles in chronic inflammatory diseases, focusing on cardiovascular diseases, and potential strategies to target innate immune memory for therapeutic purposes. Advancing the understanding of these processes could facilitate the development of novel approaches to control inflammatory diseases and immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="Immune regulation is recognized as a cornerstone therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. These disorders, driven by dysregulated immune responses, contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Although conventional immunosuppressive therapies provide symptomatic relief, their prolonged use is often associated with severe adverse effects, underscoring the need for safer and more effective treatment approaches. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), derived from immunoregulatory cells such as regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neutrophils, have emerged as promising candidates for targeted immunomodulation. These nanoscale vesicles inherit the immunosuppressive properties of their parental cells, thereby facilitating immune homeostasis while mitigating the risks associated with other cell-based therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of immunoregulatory cell-derived EVs for autoimmune disease treatment, with a particular focus on their mechanisms of action within the immune microenvironment. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential future directions in the development of EV-based therapies for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Giant congenital melanocytic nevus (GCMN) is a RAS/RAF mutation-driven syndrome characterized by extensive melanocytic lesions, posing psychological challenges and a lifelong risk of malignancy. Existing treatments like surgical resection and laser therapy fail to fully remove lesions, and MAPK inhibitors show limited efficacy. This study identified a predominant population of senescent cells and a minority of proliferative cells in GCMN, necessitating dual-targeted strategies. We found that the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 is expressed in both senescent and proliferative cells from GCMN patients with various gene mutations. Coexpression of P16 and BCL2 indicated a phenotype of growth arrest and cell survival. BCL2 inhibitors (BCL2i) showed significant cytotoxicity to GCMN cells in vitro. Hypopigmentation and GCMN cell clearance were observed in patient-derived xenograft models and in NrasQ61K-mutated and BrafV600E-mutated transgenic models following BCL2i treatment. Histology of regressed GCMN indicated extensive immune cell infiltration, suggesting immune involvement. Single-cell sequencing and immunostaining revealed that activated neutrophils formed extracellular traps, synergizing with BCL2i to treat GCMN. Neutrophil depletion and immunosuppression reduce treatment efficacy, highlighting the crucial role of the immune response post-BCL2i treatment. Long-term follow-up showed no recurrence, with neutrophils and T cells residing in the dermis, indicating memory immune reactions. These findings present a promising therapeutic strategy and underscore the translational potential of BCL2i in treating GCMN.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi leads to Chagas disease that induces profound changes in the immune response across different cell subsets, influencing parasite control and disease pathology. Dissecting the functional characteristics of distinct immune cells in patients with the asymptomatic (indeterminate - IND) or with the cardiac (CCC) clinical forms is crucial for unveiling mechanisms of disease progression and pathology and identifying disease markers.


METHODS
Here, immune-gene targeted single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from IND and CCC patients to unravel the immune landscape in this polar, well-characterized, clinical groups.


RESULTS
Our findings revealed different myeloid and lymphoid cell clusters in both cohorts, each exhibiting unique gene expression patterns. CCC was characterized by an increased frequency of KLRB1+CD4+, TBX21+CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, which exhibited upregulation of genes associated with cytotoxic and apoptotic responses. Furthermore, we observed monocyte, B cell subsets, along with dendritic cells, expressing inflammatory and notably cytotoxic genes.


CONCLUSIONS
These results reveal cell-specific changes in CCC compared to IND chronic Chagas disease patients, highlighted by distinct gene expression patterns. These nuanced changes indicate immune signature linked to the clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease, which provide information regarding disease pathology, indicating potential markers related to the disease progression.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating antigen presentation, allowing them to escape detection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and resist immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs), one of the potent antigen-presenting cells in cancer immunity, are essential for initiating adaptive immune responses. Unfortunately, DC functions are disrupted by the tumor microenvironment. Suppressive cytokines, for instance, can impair DC maturation, reduce antigen-presenting capacity, or induce DC apoptosis. A novel strategy against such challenges is reprogramming cancer cells into DC-like cells. By inducing transcription factors, cancer cells can be directed to develop a DC phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced antigen-presenting markers, co-stimulatory molecules, and an increased ability to prime naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing enhanced immune activation and tumor regression. However, limitations remain, including reprogramming efficiency, tumor heterogeneity, and safety issues that require further refinement. This review provides fundamental knowledge about DC in the tumor microenvironment and cell fate reprogramming, recent advances in reprogramming cancer cells into DCs, and eventually discusses perspectives for translating this approach into clinical settings. This innovative reprogramming strategy holds the potential to overcome current limitations in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel avenue for durable anti-tumor immunity">

        <tr id="Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) results from high-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, with bone marrow (BM) being highly susceptible due to its proliferative activity. BM injury causes pancytopenia, leading to infections, anemia, and bleeding. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold promise for ARS treatment because of their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties. However, challenges such as replicative senescence, poor survival, and engraftment in irradiated microenvironments limit their efficacy. This study evaluated rapamycin-preconditioned placenta-derived MSCs (rPD-MSCs) in a mouse ARS model. Rapamycin was selected for preconditioning due to its ability to induce autophagy and modulate cytokine secretion. We assessed rapamycin-dependent modulation of autophagy-related genes and proteins, as well as hematopoietic cytokines secretion in PD-MSCs, and evaluated morphological changes in blood and BM at 7 and 21 days post-irradiation in ICR/CD1 mice. Preconditioning with rapamycin alters the secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3LG) in PD-MSCs without affecting cell viability. rPD-MSCs better enhance hematopoietic recovery, restore bone marrow cellularity, and increase peripheral blood cell counts by elevating the secretion of hematopoietic cytokines compared to non-preconditioned cells. These results highlight rapamycin preconditioning as a promising strategy to enhance MSCs therapeutic potential for ARS, supporting further preclinical and clinical exploration.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key players in the immune system, exhibiting remarkable plasticity that allows them to influence cancer progression in opposing ways. Their polarization into M1 or M2 subtypes dictates their impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME). M1 macrophages, characterized by pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor functions, release cytokines that enhance immune responses and promote tumor destruction. Conversely, M2 macrophages support tumor growth by facilitating angiogenesis, immune suppression, and tissue remodeling, thereby creating a favorable environment for cancer progression. Further classification of M2 macrophages into subtypes M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d underscores their diverse roles in tumor development, metastasis, and immune evasion. Given their crucial role in shaping the TME, macrophages have become a major focus in cancer research. Recent therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram macrophages, shifting their phenotype from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressive. By targeting macrophage polarization, researchers seek to develop novel immunotherapies that enhance treatment efficacy, improve patient outcomes, and combat therapy resistance in cancer.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are pivotal cell populations involved in the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells. At last, anti-SIRPα enhanced the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in orthotopic and spontaneous murine models. Together, SIRPα blocked therapy reversed the immunosuppressive TIME, which provides a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating HCC.">

        <tr id="Abrogating the immunoevasive role of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) represents a critical yet still elusive challenge in cancer treatment. Progress in this area has been hampered by both technological limitations and incomplete understanding of TIME-dependent immunoevasion mechanisms. We hypothesize that the immune-evasive role of TIME subpopulations—including regulatory T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor-associated macrophages—is critically mediated by hyperconnected Master Regulator Checkpoint (MRC) modules whose aberrant activity, as induced by paracrine signals, can be abrogated or modulated either genetically or pharmacologically. MRCs are primarily composed of transcription and co-transcription factors, acting downstream of surface receptors and signal transduction cascades to control the transcriptional identity and, ultimately, the phenotype of individual TIME subpopulations. Pharmacological inhibition of subpopulation-specific MRC proteins can thus help reprogram the TIME and potentially abrogate or modulate its immunosuppressive state. This paradigm shift, away from single ligand/receptor targeting, is supported by recent algorithmic, experimental, and clinical advances allowing systematic identification of MRCs and their pharmacological modulators using systems immunology-based approaches. Refocusing the deployment of existing tools and experimental methods that have proven successful in tumor cell contexts to identify and validate MRC-targeting agents capable of remodeling the immunosuppressive cell states of the tumor microenvironment can potentially pave the road to novel combination therapy synergizing with immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cervical cancer progression is not solely driven by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection but is profoundly influenced by the local immune microenvironment, particularly chronic cytokine imbalances. Unlike the acute cytokine storms observed in infections or sepsis, cervical cancer is characterized by a persistent, low-grade, “smoldering inflammatory response” that fuels tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8 sustain a tumor-supportive milieu, promoting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and resistance to apoptosis, while immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β dampen anti-tumor immune responses and facilitate immune escape. This review explores chronic cytokine dysregulation in cervical cancer, examining how the prolonged, dysregulated cytokine network shapes the tumor microenvironment, remodels stromal interactions, and influences immune cell recruitment and function. We highlight key cytokines involved in these processes and discuss their clinical significance as potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Understanding these sustained inflammatory processes is critical because they represent a distinct biological landscape compared to acute inflammatory reactions and offer unique windows for therapeutic intervention. The paper reviewed emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these chronic cytokine pathways, including cytokine blockade, immune modulation, and combination approaches integrating immunotherapies or nanomedicine. Addressing chronic cytokine dysregulation holds promise for improving cervical cancer management and patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The immune system plays a major role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with remarkable immunosuppressive functions. We hypothesized that their anti‐inflammatory activity may dampen PF by inhibiting inflammation and its transition to fibrosis. Here, we studied the emergence of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)‐ and monocytic (M)‐MDSCs in a murine model of PF. We assessed immunological, histopathological, and clinical changes at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 following bleomycin challenge. A comprehensive overview of the role of MDSCs during the acute lung injury and chronic phase of pulmonary fibrosis is provided, along with the effects of MDSCs adoptive transfer and depletion. Inflammation and fibrosis increased over a period of 21 days after bleomycin administration. In the lung, the number of PMN‐MDSCs increased, while M‐MDSCs decreased over the time following bleomycin challenge. Especially, M‐MDSCs showed enhanced suppressive activity on day 3 following bleomycin challenge. Adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs attenuated inflammation and fibrosis development. However, depletion of PMN‐MDSCs did not lead to an exacerbation of PF. Our results suggest that adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs can ameliorate the inflammatory responses and thus the development of fibrosis in a bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis model.">

Indeed, a dynamic transfer of extracellular vesicles between cancer cells and immunological or non-immunological cells homing in the tumor microenvironment exists, and the balance between their release by cancer cells and by normal cells determines cancer progression. Here, we focused on the role of extracellular vesicles in the dysregulation of the bone marrow environment in pediatric tumors such as acute leukemias and neuroblastomata, whose poor prognosis is strictly related to the involvement of such anatomical site. Acute leukemias arise from bone marrow progenitors, whereas approximately 50% of neuroblastoma patients have bone marrow metastases at diagnosis. Thus, here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the bone marrow dysregulation in pediatric acute leukemias and neuroblastomata with particular emphasis on the involvement of extracellular vesicles.">

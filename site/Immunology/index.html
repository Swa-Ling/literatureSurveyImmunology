        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Somatic mutations inactivating TET2 are among the most common drivers of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). While TET2 inactivation is associated with monocyte-derived inflammation and improved chimeric antigen-receptor-T cell function, its impact on immunotherapy response is unknown. In our mouse model, hematopoietic Tet2 mutation enhanced immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. Enhanced ICB response with Tet2 mutation required phagocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, in Tet2-mutant tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), ICB preferentially induced anti-tumor states and restricted cell states linked to tumor progression. Tet2-mutant monocytes activated costimulatory programs, while Tet2-mutant T cells showed enhanced T cell memory signatures, lesser exhaustion and decreased regulatory phenotype. Our murine data was clinically relevant, since we found that melanomas from patients with TET2 driver mutation-CH (TET2-CH) showed enhanced immune infiltration, T cell activation, and T cell memory programs. In melanoma patients treated with ICB, TET2-CH was associated with 6-fold greater odds of clinical benefit. Collectively, our data establishes that hematopoietic Tet2 inactivation primes leukocytes for anti-tumor states associated with immunotherapy response and provides a potential biomarker for personalized therapy.">

        <tr id="Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is a major oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects, overcoming resistance with immunotherapy becomes necessary when resistance develops. However, various clinical trials have revealed that their efficacies remain limited. To investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) factors contributing to poor immune checkpoint blockade responses in ALK-positive patients, we performed single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors with and without ALK rearrangements. Integrative analysis with additional public LUAD cohorts revealed distinct immune landscapes in ALK-positive tumors, marked by enriched innate immunity and depleted adaptive immunity. ALK-positive malignant cells exhibit higher stemness and aggressive phenotype. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in these tumors predominantly maintain pro-tumoral M2-like states, reinforcing immune suppression. B cells show reduced immune reactivity and impaired tertiary lymphoid structure formation, while CD8+ T cells display bystander-like signatures and reduced tumor reactivity. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles combined with regulatory network analysis suggest that differences in transcription factor activities, rather than chromatin accessibility, may underlie T cell dysfunction. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive TME of ALK-positive LUAD, potentially explaining the failure of recent immunotherapy trials and highlighting targets for improving efficacy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally acquire immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting phenotypes, which may contribute to tumor resistance to immunotherapy. We previously showed that suppression of microRNA activity through genetic Dicer1 inactivation rewires TAM’s transcriptomes and prompts their immunostimulatory activation. This phenotypic switch enhanced recruitment and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and improved the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse cancer models. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole tumors grown in either wild-type mice or mice with macrophage-specific Dicer1 deletion. The analysis of multiple cell populations, including several discrete monocyte and macrophage subsets, indicated broad and convergent immunostimulatory programming of the tumor microenvironment, which was dependent on CTL-derived interferon-gamma (IFNγ), in mice with DICER-deficient macrophages. Intriguingly, dynamic inferences on monocyte/macrophage ontogeny and differentiation by pseudotime analysis revealed trajectories associated with progression into cell cycle, monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, and transition from an immunostimulatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors with DICER-proficient macrophages. Dicer1 deficiency interfered with this trajectory and stalled TAMs at an intermediate state between immature monocytes and macrophages with T cell-stimulatory capacity, thereby impeding immunosuppressive TAM development. This translated into enhanced response to antiangiogenic immunotherapy in an immunotherapy-resistant model of non-small cell lung cancer. Cycling/M2-like macrophages were conserved in human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and should represent a more promising therapeutic target than the bulk of TAMs.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic reinforcement of T cell exhaustion is known to be a major barrier limiting T cell responses during immunotherapy. However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients. Editor’s summary T cell immunotherapies have been successful in treating some intractable cancers, but there are limitations caused by the inability of T cells to persist after prolonged stimulation. Kang et al. undertook a reverse-translation approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the durability of T cell responsiveness to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Tsui and Kallies). Inspired by clinical observations from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome, the epigenetic regulators (Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1) associated with clonal hematopoiesis were identified using experimental models of T cell exhaustion. Epigenetic disruption of the polycomb group repressive deubiquitinase complex resulted in preservation of a stem cell–like T cell population that was responsive to immunotherapy. Extending this mechanism to cancer adoptive cell therapy, Asxl1 disruption was found to endow T cells with superior therapeutic efficacy and an ability to synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Sustained stimulation of CD8 T cells promotes the development of functional exhaustion, a terminal cell fate that has been broadly recognized to limit the durability of T cell–based immunotherapies. This state of exhaustion arises though a progressive transition of multipotent progenitor T cells (Tpex) into a terminally differentiated population (Tex) that has been defined as being nonresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The molecular determinants dictating the developmental transition are now being investigated as engineering targets to block the progression of T cell exhaustion and preserve the durability of immunotherapy approaches. RATIONALE We recently observed that the long-term survival of a small cohort of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with anti–PD-L1 therapy was coupled to mutation of the ASXL1 gene among their T cells. Mutations in ASXL1, in addition to DNMT3A and TET2, are commonly associated with conferring a survival advantage among hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in subclonal outgrowth referred to as clonal hematopoiesis. Because of their general link to cellular stemness, we investigated the role of these regulators in the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex and the impact of deletion of these regulators on therapeutic durability during anti–PD-L1 treatment. RESULTS To investigate the role of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in the development and maintenance of an ICB-responsive T cell population, we engineered T cells to contain mutations within each of these genes and then exposed them to a chronic source of antigen by adoptively transferring them into mice infected with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Disruption of these regulators in a canonical model of T cell exhaustion allowed them to maintain their quantity and ICB-responsive state for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Despite being stimulated and undergoing antigen-driven proliferation for 1 year, these T cells did not exhibit any signs of malignant outgrowth. Moreover, the total pool of T cells containing each of these mutations was enriched for a large quantity of stem-like Tcf1+ T cells. Fate-tracking adoptive transfer experiments revealed that this Tcf1+ subset of ASXL1 KO T cells could both self-renew and give rise to potent effectors. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of the knockout (KO) T cells identified Asxl1 as a regulator of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, controlling the deubiquitination of histone 2A lysine 119, which serves as a molecular checkpoint for the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex. Extension of this mechanistic insight into tumor models revealed that adoptively transferred T cells with Asxl1 disruption resisted tumor microenvironment–induced exhaustion. Moreover, the adoptively transferred Asxl1 KO T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 blockade, resulting in heightened tumor control. Finally, we show that Asxl1 disruption of tumor-specific T cells correlates with increased expansion of T cells in MDS patients after treatment with anti–PD-L1. CONCLUSION Results from these studies show that DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 control the developmental checkpoint between Tpex and terminally exhausted T cells. Specific investigation into Asxl1 revealed its role in T cell differentiation through epigenetic modification of the PR-DUB pathway. These data articulate a reverse-translation approach for defining molecular mechanisms that restrict maintenance of the ICB-responsive stem-like T cells within a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Through our mechanistic investigation of genes associated with patient survival, we have established a scientific rationale for specific genetic modification of discrete epigenetic regulators for future engineering to enhance the durability of cancer immunotherapy. Core epigenetic regulators in maintaining therapeutic durable multipotent Tpex populations. Using the canonical murine model system of exhaustion, disruption of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in CD8 T cells preserved an ICB-responsive Tpex population for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Specific investigation into the new epigenetic regulator Asxl1 revealed that this unprecedented maintenance of Tpex is mediated by presence of monoubiqutinated histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) through disruption of the PR-DUB complex.">

        <tr id="Tumor endothelial (TECs) cells play a critical role in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The main challenge against patients with cancer to derive benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 appears to be the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), in which IL-33/ST2 signal fulfills critical functions. However, whether IL-33 limits the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 remains uncertain. Methods Molecular mechanisms of IL-33/ST2 signal on anti-PD-L1 treatment lewis lung carcinoma tumor model were assessed by RNA-seq, ELISA, WB and immunofluorescence (IF). A sST2-Fc fusion protein was constructed for targeting IL-33 and combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody for immunotherapy in colon and lung tumor models. On this basis, bifunctional fusion proteins were generated for PD-L1-targeted blocking of IL-33 in tumors. The underlying mechanisms of dual targeting of IL-33 and PD-L1 revealed by RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, FACS, IF and WB. Results After anti-PD-L1 administration, tumor-infiltrating ST2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were elevated. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signal with sST2-Fc fusion protein potentiated antitumor efficacy of PD-L1 antibody by enhancing T cell responses in tumor models. Bifunctional fusion protein anti-PD-L1-sST2 exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy compared with combination therapy, not only inhibited tumor progression and extended the survival, but also provided long-term protective antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the superior antitumor activity of targeting IL-33 and PD-L1 originated from reducing immunosuppressive factors, such as Tregs and exhausted CD8+ T cells while increasing tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that IL-33/ST2 was involved in the immunosuppression mechanism of PD-L1 antibody therapy, and blockade by sST2-Fc or anti-PD-L1-sST2 could remodel the inflammatory TME and induce potent antitumor effect, highlighting the potential therapeutic strategies for the tumor treatment by simultaneously targeting IL-33 and PD-L1.">

In chronic infection, ICOS-deficiency increased both number and quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells, with accumulation of effector-like Tex due to enhanced survival. Mechanistically, loss of ICOS signaling potentiated FoxO1 activity and memory-like features of Tpex.

Here, using a mouse model of intranasal house dust mite (HDM) exposure, we showed that short-lived IgE PCs emerge in lung draining lymph nodes (dLNs) during early exposure (<3 weeks) and long-lived IgE PCs accumulate in the bone marrow (BM) with prolonged exposure (>7 weeks). IgE PCs had distinct surface and gene expression profiles in these different tissues compared with other Ig isotypes. IgE BMPCs up-regulated genes associated with prosurvival and BM homing, whereas IgE dLN PCs expressed genes associated with recent class switching and differentiation. IgE PCs also exhibited higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein coding genes and higher antibody secretion rate when compared with IgG1. Overall, this study highlights the unique developmental path and transcriptional signature of short-lived and long-lived IgE PCs. IgE plasma cells are unique.

Short-lived IgE PCs appeared early in the lung draining lymph nodes post–allergen exposure, whereas long-lived bone marrow (BM) IgE PCs were not detected until much later. IgE BMPCs from humans with allergy also had unique transcriptional signatures. These findings demonstrate that IgE PCs are developmentally, transcriptionally, and functionally unique. —Hannah Isles">

However, the impact of obesity on the functional landscape of immune cells during arthritogenic alphavirus infection remains unexplored. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the blood and tissue immune responses to Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection in lean and obese mice. Footpad injection of MAYV caused significant shifts in immune cell populations and induced robust expression of interferon response and proinflammatory cytokine genes and related pathways in both blood and tissue. In MAYV-infected lean mice, analysis of the local tissue response revealed a unique macrophage subset with high expression of IFN response genes that was not found in obese mice. This was associated with less severe inflammation in lean mice. These results provide evidence for a unique macrophage population that may contribute to the superior capacity of lean mice to control arthritogenic alphavirus infection.

However, the ability of CD4+ T cells to suppress Mtb growth cannot be fully explained by IFN-γ or other known T cell products. In this study, we show that CD4+ T cell-derived IFN-γ promoted the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. Although the recruited MDMs became quickly and preferentially infected with Mtb, CD4+ T cells rapidly disinfected the MDMs. Clearance of Mtb from MDMs was not explained by IFN-γ, but rather by MHCII-mediated cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells.

Thus, by recruiting MDMs, CD4+ T cells initiate a cycle of bacterial phagocytosis, Mtb antigen presentation and disinfection in an attempt to clear the bacteria from the lungs.">

        <tr id="Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are pathologically activated neutrophils that potently impair immunotherapy responses. The chemokine receptor CXCR4, a central regulator of hematopoiesis, represents an attractive PMN-MDSC target1. Here, we fused a secreted CXCR4 partial agonist TFF2 to mouse serum albumin (MSA) and demonstrated that TFF2-MSA peptide synergized with anti-PD-1 to induce tumor regression or eradication, inhibited distant metastases, and prolonged survival in multiple gastric cancer (GC) models. Using histidine decarboxylase (Hdc)-GFP transgenic mice to track PMN-MDSC in vivo, we found TFF2-MSA selectively reduced the immunosuppressive Hdc-GFP+ CXCR4hi tumor PMN-MDSCs while preserving proinflammatory neutrophils, thereby boosting CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor response together with anti-PD-1. Furthermore, TFF2-MSA systemically reduced PMN-MDSCs and bone marrow granulopoiesis. In contrast, CXCR4 antagonism plus anti-PD-1 failed to provide a similar therapeutic benefit. In GC patients, expanded PMN-MDSCs containing a prominent CXCR4+LOX-1+ subset are inversely correlated with the TFF2 level and CD8+ T cells in circulation. Collectively, our studies introduce a strategy of using CXCR4 partial agonism to restore anti-PD-1 sensitivity in GC by targeting PMN-MDSCs and granulopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Despite our increasing understanding of macrophage heterogeneity, drivers of macrophage phenotypic and functional polarization in the microenvironment are not fully elucidated. Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK+ macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK+ macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK+ macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of MerTK+ macrophages and provide strategies for improving the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant healthcare burden worldwide, characterized by a complex interplay between obesity and chronic inflammation. While the relationship between CRC, obesity and altered lipid metabolism is not fully understood, there are evidences suggesting a link between them. In this study, we hypothesized that dysregulated lipid metabolism contributes to local accumulation of foam cells (FC) in CRC, which in turn disrupts antitumor immunosurveillance. Methods Tumor infiltrating FC and CD8+ were quantified by digital pathology in patients affected by T2–T4 CRC with any N stage undergoing radical upfront surgery (n=65) and correlated with patients’ clinical outcomes. Multiparametric high-resolution flow cytometry analysis and bulk RNAseq of CRC tissue were conducted to evaluate the phenotype and transcriptomic program of immune cell infiltrate in relation to FC accumulation. The immunosuppressive effects of FC and mechanistic studies on FC-associated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and anti-PD-L1 inhibition were explored using an in-vitro human model of lipid-engulfed macrophages. Results FC (large CD68+ Bodipy+ macrophages) accumulated at the tumor margin in CRC samples. FChigh tumors exhibited reduced CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cells (Tregs). Functional transcriptional profiling depicted an immunosuppressed milieu characterized by reduced interferon gamma, memory CD8+ T cells, and activated macrophages mirrored by increased T-cell exhaustion and Treg enrichment. Furthermore, FChigh tumor phenotype was independent of standard clinical factors but correlated with high body mass index (BMI) and plasma saturated fatty acid levels. In CD8low tumors, the FChigh phenotype was associated with a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 8.6% compared with 28.7% of FClow (p=0.001). In-vitro studies demonstrated that FC significantly impact on CD8 proliferation in TFG-β dependent manner, while inhibition of TGF-β FC-related factors restored antitumor immunity. Conclusions FC exert immunosuppressive activity through a TGF-β-related pathway, resulting in a CD8-excluded microenvironment and identifying immunosuppressed tumors with worse prognosis in patients with primary CRC. FC association with patient BMI and dyslipidemia might explain the link of CRC with obesity, and offers novel therapeutic and preventive perspectives in this specific clinical setting.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to have a poor prognosis due to its ability to relapse following initial response to chemotherapy. While immunotherapies hold the promise to revolutionize cancer treatment, AML has been particularly challenging to target. It is therefore important to better understand the relationship between AML cells and immune cells within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, where this disease grows. Here we focus on non-malignant BM macrophages, and using a combination of intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, transcriptomics and functional analyses we identify a subpopulation of immunomodulatory BM macrophages (IMMs) with a unique profile and function during AML progression. While the majority of macrophages are already being lost at early infiltration, IMMs are locally enriched. They are capable of efferocytosis and support AML growth through inhibition of T cells. Enrichment of IMMs in the BM of patients developing early relapse indicates that future development of interventions that target IMMs’ development and function may improve AML patients’ outcome.">

        <tr id="CAR-T therapy is a promising new immunotherapy for cancers, but its efficacy for solid tumors requires improvement. A detailed understanding of the interplay between solid tumors and CAR-T cells is critical. Here we report temporal, multi-modal, single-cell profiling of patient-derived glioblastoma organoids with CAR-T treatment. We found that all tumor cell types responded to CAR-T cell activation and contributed to an initially anti-tumor, but subsequently pro-tumor and immune-inhibitory microenvironment, accompanied by CAR-T cell exhaustion. Unexpectedly, CAR-T treatment attenuated glioma stem-like states of both antigen-positive and antigen-negative neoplastic cells and reduced their proliferation via diffusible factors, including IFNγ. Analysis of samples from additional patients, including those in clinical trials, supported these findings. Our study reveals the dynamic interplay among different tumor cells and T cells in adaptive responses to immunotherapy and identifies previously unappreciated benefits of CAR-T therapy directly on antigen-negative neoplastic cells that may be leveraged to enhance therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who will progress to severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. In patients with overweight/obesity these signatures are exacerbated compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic capacity compared to non-SD. Furthermore, type-I Interferon signalling is downregulated in SD, suggesting defective virus-sensing mechanisms may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional “professional killer” T/NK-cells underpin dengue pathogenesis. Our findings pave the way for the evaluation of immunomodulatory therapies for dengue.">

We identified overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in HIV-infected CD4⁺ T- cells that survive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) exposure, suggesting a mechanism of CTL resistance. Inhibition of EZH2 with the FDA-approved drug tazemetostat increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on CD4⁺ T-cells, counterbalancing HIV Nef–mediated MHC-I downregulation. This improved CTL-mediated elimination of HIV-infected cells and suppressed viral replication in vitro. In a participant-derived xenograft mouse model, tazemetostat elevated MHC-I and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CD4⁺ T-cells, facilitating CD8⁺ T-cell–mediated reductions of HIV reservoir seeding. Additionally, tazemetostat promoted sustained skewing of CD8⁺ T-cells toward less differentiated and exhausted phenotypes. Our findings reveal EZH2 overexpression as a novel mechanism of CTL resistance and support the clinical evaluation of tazemetostat to enhance clearance of HIV reservoirs and improve CD8+ T-cell function.">

        <tr id="The potent immunostimulatory effects of toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonism in combination with PD-1 blockade have resulted in various preclinical investigations, yet the mechanism of action in humans remains unknown. To decipher the combinatory mode of action of TLR8 agonism and PD-1 blockade, we employed a unique, open-label, phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity clinical trial (NCT03906526) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T- cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients. This study provides key insights into the mode of action of TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade immune targeting in HNSCC patients.">

        <tr id="Cytokine induced memory-like natural killer (CIML NK) cells combined with an IL-15 super-agonist (N-803) are a novel modality to treat relapsed/refractory head and neck cancer. We report data from a phase I trial of haploidentical CIML NK cells combined with N-803 with or without ipilimumab (IPI) in relapsed/refractory head and neck cancer patients after a median of 6 prior lines of therapy. The primary endpoint was safety, which was established, with dose-limiting toxicity in 1/10 patients. A promising though transient disease control rate of 70% correlated with donor NK cell expansion, the latter occurring irrespective of IPI. High-resolution immunophenotypic and transcriptional profiling characterized the NK cells and their interacting partners in vivo. IPI was associated with contraction of Treg:Tcon, rapid recovery of recipient CD8+ T cells, and accelerated rejection of donor NK cells. These results inform evaluation of CIML NK therapy for advanced malignancies, with considerations for combination with IPI.">

        <tr id="Macrophages orchestrate tissue homeostasis and immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

TNFSF13 is a cytokine important for B cell maturation and function, but roles for epithelial TNFSF13 and putative contribution to inflammatory bowel disease are poorly understood. We evaluated functional consequences of a novel monoallelic TNFSF13 variant using biopsies, tissue-derived colonoids and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived colon organoids. TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited a >50% reduction in secreted TNFSF13, increased epithelial proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids. Single cell RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation identified FAS as the predominant colonic epithelial receptor for TNFSF13. Imaging mass cytometry revealed an increase in epithelial-associated B cells in TNFSF13 variant colon tissue sections. Finally, TNFSF13 variant colonoids co-cultured with memory B cells demonstrated a reduction in the production of IgA+ plasma cells compared to control colonoid co-cultures.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells suppress cellular and humoral immune responses via killing of T cells, resulting in diminished vaccine responses in mice and humans. Efforts to overcome this roadblock and achieve optimal immunity require an improved understanding of the molecular mediators facilitating NK cell-targeting of discrete subsets of CD4 T cells. We employed single-cell forensic victimology and CRISPR-Cas9 editing to delineate a transcriptional program uniquely responsible for the susceptibility of a subpopulation of CD4 T cells to perforin-dependent immunoregulation by NK cells. The unique vulnerability of these CD4 T cells relative to other subsets of CD4 T cells was not associated with a pattern of NK-cell-receptor ligand expression that would favor activation of NK cells. Instead, susceptible CD4 T cells were skewed toward follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation and exhibited intermediate expression of Klf2 and a related suite of KLF2-target genes (e.g. S1pr1) involved in cell migration and spatial positioning. NK-cell dependent suppression of the subset of Tfh exhibiting intermediate expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 was confirmed with single-cell proteomics. CRISPR targeting of KLF2 in CD4 T cells prevented suppression by NK cells. Thus, KLF2 regulation of spatial positioning of T cells is a key determinant of NK-cell immunoregulatory function and a possible target for strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy.">

CD8+ T cells are abundant within MS lesions, but their potential role in disease pathology remains unclear. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the cotwin had either no or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease. Proinflammatory features of CD8+ T cells in multiple sclerosis may serve as potential therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages. Editor’s summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the nervous system in which CD8 T cells are present in MS lesions, but their role in disease progression remains unclear. Kavaka et al. analyzed CD8 T cells from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of monozygotic twins, where one twin had MS and the other showed no signs or subclinical signs of neuroinflammation (SCNI). CD8 T cells from individuals with MS and cotwins with SCNI exhibited proinflammatory immunological and metabolic features consistent with enhanced activation and migration. These findings were validated in a separate cohort of individuals with MS, providing insights into the role of CD8 T cells in MS progression. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

One correlate of response is the reinvigoration of a subset of CD8 T cells that have an exhausted phenotype and impaired functionality. In order to develop new therapies, reproducible models are required to identify candidate target genes that enables the reversal of key hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Here we describe the development of an in vitro model by chronically stimulating T cells with their cognate antigen and performed an in depth temporal phenotypic characterisation. This model recapitulates many of the critical hallmarks of exhaustion, including increased expression of canonical exhaustion surface markers, impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production, decreased release of cytotoxic granules, and metabolic alterations, including dysfunctional mitochondria. These exhaustion hallmarks were validated using an in vivo model and a gene signature identified which robustly define the shared in vitro and in vivo exhausted state. Critically, this signature is also observed in tumour infiltrating T cells from multiple human tumour types, validating the translational potential of this model for discovering and triaging new therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background In a previously reported Phase I trial, we observed therapy‐associated declines in circulating myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with the administration of white button mushroom (WBM) tablets in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. These observations led us to hypothesise that WBM could mitigate PCa progression by suppressing MDSCs. Methods We performed bidirectional translational research to examine the immunomodulatory effects of WBM consumption in both syngeneic murine PCa models and patients with PCa participating in an ongoing randomised Phase II trial (NCT04519879). Results In murine models, WBM treatment significantly suppressed tumour growth with a reduction in both the number and function of MDSCs, which in turn promoted antitumour immune responses mediated by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In patients, after consumption of WBM tablets for 3 months, we observed a decline in circulating polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN‐MDSCs), along with an increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T and NK cells. Furthermore, single immune cell profiling of peripheral blood from WBM‐treated patients showed suppressed STAT3/IRF1 and TGFβ signalling in circulating PMN‐MDSCs. Subclusters of PMN‐MDSCs presented transcriptional profiles associated with responsiveness to fungi, neutrophil chemotaxis, leukocyte aggregation, and regulation of inflammatory response. Finally, in mouse models of PCa, we found that WBM consumption enhanced the anticancer activity of anti‐PD‐1 antibodies, indicating that WBM may be used as an adjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Conclusion Our results from PCa murine models and patients provide mechanistic insights into the immunomodulatory effects of WBM and provide a scientific foundation for WBM as a nutraceutical intervention to delay or prevent PCa progression. Highlights White button mushroom (WBM) treatment resulted in a reduction in pro‐tumoural MDSCs, notably polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN‐MDSCs), along with activation of anti‐tumoural T and NK cells. Human single immune cell gene expression profiling shed light on the molecular alterations induced by WBM, specifically on PMN‐MDSCs. A proof‐of‐concept study combining WBM with PD‐1 blockade in murine models revealed an additive effect on tumour regression and survival outcomes, highlighting the clinical relevance of WBM in cancer management.">

        <tr id="MALT1 protease is an intracellular signaling molecule that promotes tumor progression via cancer cell-intrinsic and cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. MALT1 has been mostly studied in lymphocytes, and little is known about its role in tumor-associated macrophages. Here, we show that MALT1 plays a key role in glioblastoma (GBM)-associated macrophages. Mechanistically, GBM tumor cells induce a MALT1-NF-κB signaling axis within macrophages, leading to macrophage migration and polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Inactivation of MALT1 protease promotes transcriptional reprogramming that reduces migration and restores a macrophage “M1-like” phenotype. Preclinical in vivo analysis shows that MALT1 inhibitor treatment results in increased immuno-reactivity of GBM-associated macrophages and reduced GBM tumor growth. Further, the addition of MALT1 inhibitor to temozolomide reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, which may enhance the efficacy of this standard-of-care chemotherapeutic. Together, our findings suggest that MALT1 protease inhibition represents a promising macrophage-targeted immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of GBM. Graphical abstract.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has quickly risen to become the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. This is in part because of its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here, we investigated an immunotherapy approach combining delivery of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) innate immune agonists by lipid-based nanoparticle (NP) coencapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies, which can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other proinflammatory signaling pathways, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell–driven and type I interferon–mediated tumor regression and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models dependent on both tumor and host STING activation. STING and TLR4-mediated type I interferon signaling was also associated with enhanced natural killer and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC samples. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can orchestrate a coordinated type I interferon–driven innate and adaptive immune response with durable antitumor efficacy against PDAC. Combining MEK/CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING/TLR4 agonists leads to T cell–mediated control of pancreatic tumors in mice. Editor’s summary Unlike other tumor types, existing immunotherapies have not proven very successful for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), necessitating the development of additional approaches. Here, Chibaya et al. developed a combination therapy approach that included nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists, which stimulate the immune response, in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which promote senescence of tumor cells. The combination therapy induced robust antitumor immune responses that controlled tumor burden in implanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models. These data support further development of this potent combination therapy for PDAC. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy can lead to long-term survival for some cancer patients, yet generalized success has been hampered by insufficient antigen presentation and exclusion of immunogenic cells from the tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed an approach to reprogram tumor cells in vivo by adenoviral delivery of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3, which enabled them to present antigens as type 1 conventional dendritic cells. Reprogrammed tumor cells remodeled their tumor microenvironment, recruited, and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic T cells; induced tumor regressions; and established long-term systemic immunity in multiple mouse melanoma models. In human tumor spheroids and xenografts, reprogramming to immunogenic dendritic-like cells progressed independently of immunosuppression, which usually limits immunotherapy. Our study paves the way for human clinical trials of in vivo immune cell reprogramming for cancer immunotherapy. Editor’s summary The success of cancer immunotherapy can be limited by mechanisms that tumors develop to evade destruction by the immune system. Tumors can block the activation and obstruct the ability of immune cells (dendritic cells and T lymphocytes) to destroy the tumor, thereby creating an environment that is beneficial for cancer growth. Ascic et al. developed an approach to directly reprogram cancer cells into dendritic cells in vivo by delivering the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 with an adenoviral vector (see the Perspective by Zhou and Wu). The transcription factors promoted dendritic cell–like functions and enabled the engineered tumor cells to present antigens and mount cancer-specific T cell immune responses. The tumor-to-immune cell “reprogramming” reshaped the tumor microenvironment, triggering tumor regressions and systemic immunity. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION The success of cancer immunotherapy depends on the priming of tumor-specific T cells. However, tumor cells often down-regulate antigen presentation and mount an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which excludes immunogenic antigen-presenting cells from the tumor. These limitations hinder the broad success of cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade. Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), a rare subset of dendritic cells, are key for recruiting and activating cytotoxic T cells, and their presence in tumors correlates with improved survival. Previous studies showed that the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 (PIB) can directly reprogram fibroblasts or tumor cells into antigen-presenting cDC1-like cells in vitro within 9 days. However, ex vivo cell manipulation and readministration of these reprogrammed cells pose significant challenges for clinical application. RATIONALE We hypothesized that the reprogramming of tumor cells into cDC1-like cells could occur entirely in vivo within the tumor microenvironment. This approach would foster T cell activation by leveraging the unique functions of cDC1. Using a combination of syngeneic models, xenografts, and human cancer spheroids from multiple cancer types, we characterized local and systemic immune responses triggered by reprogramming and developed a viral platform for delivering PIB directly to tumors. RESULTS In vivo tumor cell reprogramming demonstrated faster kinetics and higher fidelity than in vitro approaches and resulted in tumor-resident cDC1-like cells showing a mature, immunogenic signature. Reprogramming efficiently progressed in human cancer spheroids despite the presence of immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or pericytes, leading to T cell activation and tumor cell elimination. In murine immune-competent models, reprogrammed tumor cells recruited and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic and memory T cells within the tumor while reducing exhausted and regulatory populations. The formation of tertiary lymphoid structures containing B, T, and stromal cells was observed, switching the immune response from “cold” to “hot.” Immune remodeling led to tumor regression independently of endogenous cDC1. CD4+ T cells were identified as critical mediators, because their depletion with antibodies abolished the therapeutic response. Furthermore, in vivo reprogramming established tumor-specific systemic immunity and immunological memory in melanoma models with varying profiles of immunogenicity and responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. In addition to the monotherapy effects, we observed a marked synergy with anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) or anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (anti–CTLA-4) immunotherapies. We further confirmed that reprogramming <2% of cells was sufficient to trigger tumor regression, supporting the intratumoral delivery of reprogramming factors. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates that in situ delivery of PIB using adenoviral vectors induces the generation of cDC1-like cells within tumors, leading to remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, and the expansion of polyclonal cytotoxic and memory T cells. This work provides preclinical proof-of-concept for an off-the-shelf, tumor-specific immunotherapy that can orchestrate systemic and durable antitumor immunity. In vivo reprogramming of tumor cells to dendritic cells. (1) Adenoviral delivery of PIB to tumors generates cDC1-like cells, marked by XCR1, CLEC9A, MHC-I/II, and CD40 expression. (2) Reprogrammed tumor cells promote the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and polyclonal cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, (3) leading to tumor regression, immunological memory, and the control of abscopal tumors and lung metastasis.

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma has a unique tumor microenvironment (TME), which is characterized as a complex microenvironment comprising of bone cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and heterogeneous vascular structures. These elements are intricately embedded in a mineralized extracellular matrix, setting it apart from other primary TMEs. In a state of normal physiological function, these cell types collaborate in a coordinated manner to maintain the homeostasis of the bone and hematopoietic systems. However, in the pathological condition, i.e., neoplastic malignancies, the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) has been shown to promote cancer cells proliferation, migration, apoptosis and drug resistance, as well as immune escape. The intricate and dynamic system of the TIME in osteosarcoma involves crucial roles played by various infiltrating cells, the complement system, and exosomes. This complexity is closely associated with tumor cells evading immune surveillance, experiencing uncontrolled proliferation, and facilitating metastasis. In this review, we elucidate the intricate interplay between diverse cell populations in the osteosarcoma TIME, each contributing uniquely to tumor progression. From chondroblastic and osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells to osteoclasts, stromal cells, and various myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets, the comprehensive single-cell analysis provides a detailed roadmap of the complex osteosarcoma ecosystem. Furthermore, we summarize the mutations, epigenetic mechanisms, and extracellular vesicles that dictate the immunologic landscape and modulate the TIME of osteosarcoma. The perspectives of the clinical implementation of immunotherapy and therapeutic approaches for targeting immune cells are also intensively discussed.">

        <tr id="High-grade gliomas are a major health challenge with poor prognosis and high morbidity. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have emerged as promising therapeutic options for several malignancies yet show little efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) tumors. CD200 is a newly recognized immune checkpoint that modulates immune homeostasis. CD200 protein is expressed by a variety of cells, including immune cells and stromal cells, and is overexpressed by many tumors. The shedding of CD200 from tumor cells can create an immunosuppressive environment that dampens anti-tumor immunity by modulating cytolytic activity and cytokine expression both within and outside the tumor microenvironment (TME). While it is well-accepted that CD200 induces a pro-tumorigenic environment through its ability to suppress the immune response, we sought to determine the role of glioma-specific expression of CD200. We show that CD200 is expressed across glioma types, is shed from tumor cells, and increases over time in the serum of patients undergoing immunotherapy. Using CD200 knockout (KO) glioma models, we demonstrated that glioma cell-derived CD200 promotes tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Notably, CD200 KO gliomas are spontaneously rejected by their host, a process that required a fully functional immune system, including NK and T-cells. Moreover, we report that glioma-derived or brain-injected soluble CD200 contributes to the suppression of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Our work provides new mechanistic insights regarding CD200-mediated immunosuppression by gliomas.

        <tr id="HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive demyelinating disease of the spinal cord due to chronic inflammation. Hallmarks of disease pathology include dysfunctional anti-viral responses and the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system. HAM/TSP individuals exhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with elevated co-expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), but ICP blockade strategies can only partially restore CD8+ T-cell effector function. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles, can enhance the spread of viral infections and blunt anti-viral responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of exosomes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells and HAM/TSP patient sera on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell phenotypes and function. We observed that exosomes derived from HTLV-infected cell lines (OSP2) elicit proinflammatory cytokine responses in DCs, promote helper CD4+ T-cell polarization, and suppress CD8+ T-cell effector function. Furthermore, exosomes from individuals with HAM/TSP stimulate CD4+ T-cell polarization, marked by increased Th1 and regulatory T-cell differentiation. We conclude that exosomes in the setting of HAM/TSP are detrimental to DC and T-cell function and may contribute to the progression of pathology with HTLV-1 infection.">

However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-α was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-α-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-α and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH.

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) belong to a continuous disease spectrum of myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory setting necessitating novel therapies. Natural killer (NK) cells from patients with myeloid malignancies display global dysfunction with impaired killing capacity, altered metabolism, and an exhausted phenotype at the single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In this study, we identified that this dysfunction was mediated through a cross-talk between NK cells and myeloid blasts necessitating cell-cell contact. NK cell dysfunction could be prevented by targeting the αvβ-integrin/TGF-β/SMAD pathway but, once established, was persistent because of profound epigenetic reprogramming. We identified BATF as a core transcription factor and the main mediator of this NK cell dysfunction in AML. Mechanistically, we found that BATF was directly regulated and induced by SMAD2/3 and, in turn, bound to key genes related to NK cell exhaustion, such as HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and CTLA4. BATF deletion enhanced NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism of NK immune evasion in AML manifested by epigenetic rewiring and inactivation of NK cells by myeloid blasts. This work highlights the importance of using healthy allogeneic NK cells as an adoptive cell therapy to treat patients with myeloid malignancies combined with strategies aimed at preventing the dysfunction by targeting the TGF-β pathway or BATF. BATF deletion prevents epigenetic rewiring and enhances the antitumor activity of NK cells in AML. Editor’s summary Patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often relapse after standard of care. To improve outcomes, Kumar et al. have investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in antitumor immunity against myeloid blasts and have identified global dysfunction of NK cells in these patients. They identified BATF as responsible for this dysfunction, and by knocking out BATF downstream of the TGF-β canonical pathway in NK cells, they were able to enhance NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. This has led to the initiation of a promising clinical trial using these TGFBR2 knockout NK cells against myeloid malignancies. —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key mediators of lung function and are potential targets for therapies during respiratory infections. TGFβ is an important regulator of AM differentiation and maintenance, but how TGFβ directly modulates the innate immune responses of AMs remains unclear. This shortcoming prevents effective targeting of AMs to improve lung function in health and disease. Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGFβ in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGFβ regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGFβ maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGFβ alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGFβ (+) and TGFβ (−) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists. Together, these data suggest that TGFβ modulates AM metabolic networks and innate immune signaling cascades to control inflammatory pathways in AMs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Antibodies that target immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) are approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. Chemotherapy is often administered with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies that target CTLA-4 and/or PD-(L)1. ICB targeting other immune checkpoints such as lymphocyte activating gene-3 (LAG-3) has the potential to improve antitumor responses when combined with chemotherapy. Response to anti-PD-1 ICB is dependent on progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) in the tumor, but it is unclear how chemotherapy alters TPEX proportions and phenotype. Methods Here we investigated whether sequential chemotherapy altered TPEX frequency and immune checkpoint expression in multiple murine tumor models. Results Two doses of two different anti-metabolite chemotherapies increased tumor infiltrating CD4+, and CD8+ TPEX expressing LAG-3 in multiple mouse models, which was not restricted to tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells. To determine if LAG-3+tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could be targeted to improve tumor control, we administered anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 ICB after two doses of chemotherapy and found combination therapy generated robust antitumor responses compared with each agent alone. Both anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 ICB with chemotherapy were required for the complete tumor regression observed. Conclusions Changes in immune checkpoint expression on TILs during chemotherapy administration informs selection of ICB therapies to combine with.">

        <tr id="Emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive inflammation. Preclinical studies suggest that lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) treatment dampen inflammation. We investigated the effects of bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) and LVRS on circulating and pulmonary immune cell profiles in emphysema patients using mass cytometry. Blood and resected lung tissue were collected at the first LVRS (L1). Following 6–10 weeks of recovery, patients received a placebo or intravenous administration of 2 × 106 cells/kg bodyweight BM-MSC (n = 5 and n = 9, resp.) in week 3 and 4 before the second LVRS (L2), where blood and lung tissue were collected. Irrespective of BM-MSC or placebo treatment, proportions of circulating lymphocytes including central memory CD4 regulatory, effector memory CD8 and γδ T cells were higher, whereas myeloid cell percentages were lower in L2 compared to L1. In resected lung tissue, proportions of Treg (p = 0.0067) and anti-inflammatory CD163− macrophages (p = 0.0001) were increased in L2 compared to L1, while proportions of pro-inflammatory CD163+ macrophages were decreased (p = 0.0004). There were no effects of BM-MSC treatment on immune profiles in emphysema patients. However, we observed alterations in the circulating and pulmonary immune cells upon LVRS, suggesting the induction of anti-inflammatory responses potentially needed for repair processes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT High-grade serious ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an aggressive malignancy that remains refractory to current immunotherapies. While advanced stage disease has been extensively studied, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote early immune escape in HGSOC remain largely unexplored. Here, we report that primary HGSO tumors program neutrophils to inhibit T cell anti-tumor function by activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1α. We found that intratumoral neutrophils exhibited overactivation of ER stress response markers compared with their counterparts at non-tumor sites. Selective deletion of IRE1α in neutrophils delayed primary ovarian tumor growth and extended the survival of mice with HGSOC by enabling early T cell-mediated tumor control. Notably, loss of IRE1α in neutrophils sensitized tumor-bearing mice to PD-1 blockade, inducing HGSOC regression and long-term survival in ~ 50% of the treated hosts. Hence, neutrophil-intrinsic IRE1α facilitates early adaptive immune escape in HGSOC and targeting this ER stress sensor might be used to unleash endogenous and immunotherapy-elicited immunity that controls metastatic disease.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the generation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector and memory T cells. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The intestinal immune system maintains a balance between active immunity needed for protection and tolerance towards harmless antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) found in the intestinal mucosa are key to the adaptive arm of these immunoregulatory events. DCs sample antigens in the tissue and then migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime the T cells that then migrate back to the tissue as effector or regulatory cells. Intestinal DC are highly heterogeneous, and it remains unclear exactly which subsets induces the different kinds of immune response, or what signalling molecules and cellular mechanisms are involved. Here, we have studied these issues using Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) infection in mice, a model which is uniquely suited to dissecting this regulatory circuit in the gut, where it drives type 2 protective immunity at the same time as inhibiting other aspects of the immune response. Here, we characterise intestinal DC during Hpb infection for the first time. We observed a dynamical change of intestinal DC populations throughout the course of infection that correlated with altered phenotype and function. In particular, Hpb infection saw a rise in a population of CD103+ DC2 that retained a potent ability to drive Tregs during the infection and unlike CD103-DC2, had a reduced ability to induce pro-inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that TGFβ signalling may be responsible for some of the changes observed. This was confirmed in vitro, where supplementation TGFβ or Hpb-produced TGFβ mimic (TGM) replicated the immunomodulatory effects seen in DCs in vivo. Together, these results present a mechanistic explanation of how helminths such as Hpb may modulate host immune responses by altering the differentiation and function of local DCs. Furthermore, our work provides the basis for understanding immune homeostasis in the intestine at the molecular and cellular levels. Thus, this work fills out a crucial gap in our knowledge of basic biology underlining the DC decision between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response in the central circuit of adaptive immune response.">

        <tr id="The generation of effector CD8+ T cells (TEFF) requires activation of naive CD8+ T cells (TN) by dendritic cells (DCs) within lymphoid tissue. To date, it remains elusive how the duration of TN-DC interactions and integration of activation signals are controlled in vivo. Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses. In sum, our findings uncover that lymphoid stromal chemokines act as built-in “disruptors” of T cell-DC interactions for long-term preservation of TEFF functionality.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors have substantial advanced tumor treatment, but their limited benefits and strong responses in only a subset of patients remain challenging. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory function of contactin-4 (CNTN4). CNTN4 was highly expressed in tumor tissues, and expression impaired the antitumor function of T cells. CNTN4 bound to amyloid precursor protein (APP) on T cells, which attenuated conjugation between cancer cells and T cells, and diminished T cell receptor signaling cascades. We developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) that blocked the binding between CNTN4 and APP. Administration of either GENA-104A16 or 5A7 promoted antitumor T cell responses in a syngeneic mouse model and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo. Furthermore, elevated CNTN4 levels were associated with poor prognosis and negatively correlated with various cytotoxic immune-related markers. These results suggest that CNTN4-APP is an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Targeting the CNTN4-APP axis may boost anticancer immunity and improve conventional immunotherapy efficacy. Editor’s summary Contactin-4 (CNTN4) is an adhesion molecule known to engage amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain, but the function of this axis in T cells and antitumor immunity is not known. Jeon et al. explored the immunomodulatory role of CNTN4-APP, finding that CNTN4 expressed on tumor cells prevents T cell activation by engaging APP on T cells. They developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) and found that blocking the CNTN4-APP interaction promoted tumor killing. Expression of APP on T cells negatively correlated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. These findings indicate that CNTN4-APP functions as an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell engagers (TCEs) are becoming an integral class of biological therapeutic owing to their highly potent ability to eradicate cancer cells. Nevertheless, the widespread utility of classical CD3-targeted TCEs has been limited by narrow therapeutic index (TI) linked to systemic CD4+ T cell activation and aberrant cytokine release. One attractive approach to circumvent the systemic activation of pan CD3+ T cells and reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome is to redirect specific subsets of T cells. A promising strategy is the use of peptide-major histocompatibility class I bispecific antibodies (pMHC-IgGs), which have emerged as an intriguing modality of TCE, based on their ability to selectively redirect highly reactive viral-specific effector memory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to eliminate cancer cells. However, the relatively low frequency of these effector memory cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may hamper their redirection as effector cells for clinical applications. To mitigate this potential limitation, we report here the generation of a pMHC-IgG derivative known as guided-pMHC-staging (GPS) carrying a covalent fusion of a monovalent interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutein (H16A, F42A). Using an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) arm as a proof-of-concept, tumor-associated antigen paired with a single-chain HLA-A *02:01/CMVpp65 pMHC fusion moiety, we demonstrate in vitro that the IL-2-armored GPS modality robustly expands CMVpp65-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells and induces potent cytotoxic activity against target cancer cells. Similar to GPS, IL-2-armored GPS molecules induce modulated T cell activation and reduced cytokine release profile compared to an analogous CD3-targeted TCE. In vivo we show that IL-2-armored GPS, but not the corresponding GPS, effectively expands grafted CMVpp65 CD8+ T cells from unstimulated human PBMCs in an NSG mouse model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the IL-2-armored GPS modality exhibits a favorable developability profile and monoclonal antibody-like pharmacokinetic properties in human neonatal Fc receptor transgenic mice. Overall, IL-2-armored GPS represents an attractive approach for treating cancer with the potential for inducing vaccine-like antiviral T cell expansion, immune cell redirection as a TCE, and significantly widened TI due to reduced cytokine release.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer immunotherapy has evolved rapidly in the last decade. A newly emerging immunotherapeutic approach utilizes oncolytic viruses to enhance the ability of the body’s own immune system to recognize and clear tumor cells. We have recently developed a novel chimeric oncolytic virus and demonstrated its anti-tumoral effects in various preclinical mouse models. To gain mechanistic insights into the immune response to this form of therapy at the cellular level and to identify targets to potentially further improve the therapy, we analyzed the immune cell signature in the tumors, blood, and lymphoid tissue in a syngeneic melanoma mouse model by flow cytometry. Both local and systemic immune responses were observed. Furthermore, selective depletion of cytotoxic T cells indicated that these cells are the main players in mediating the therapeutic response to this novel virotherapy. Abstract Background/Objectives: Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. We have previously described a recombinant hybrid oncolytic virus (OV), VSV-NDV, which has a favorable safety profile and therapeutic immunogenicity, leading to direct oncolysis, abscopal effects, and prolonged survival in syngeneic in vivo tumor models. While OVs are known to mediate systemic anti-tumor immune responses, the detailed characterization of local and systemic immune responses to fusogenic oncolytic virotherapy remains unexplored. Methods and Results: We analyzed immune cell compartments in the spleen, blood, tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and tumors over the course of VSV-NDV therapy in a bilateral syngeneic melanoma mouse model. Our results revealed significant local infiltration and activation of T lymphocytes in tumors and globally in the blood and spleen. Notably, in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion led to complete abrogation of the tumor response, highlighting the crucial role of T cells in promoting the therapeutic effects of oncolytic VSV-NDV. In vitro co-culture experiments enabled the interrogation of human immune cell responses to VSV-NDV-mediated oncolysis. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were efficiently stimulated by exposure to VSV-NDV-infected cancer cells, which recapitulates the in vivo murine findings. Conclusions: Taken together, these data characterize a broad anti-tumor immune cell response to oncolytic VSV-NDV therapy and suggest that CD8+ T cells play a decisive role in therapeutic outcome, which supports the further development of this chimeric vector as a multimechanistic immunotherapy for solid cancers.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the regenerative force of the gut epithelium. Lgr5+-ISC have been shown to respond to changes in their microenvironment by coping with different metabolites, adapting to caloric changes, and recovering from injury and inflammation. However, how pathogenic bacteria affect adult stem cell regeneration and, as a consequence, the overall tissue adaption to infection has yet to be explored in depth. Here, we interrogated early Lgr5+ ISC responses to an enteric intracellular pathogen by profiling individual IECs from the mouse small intestine. Utilizing GFP-labeled Salmonella enterica, we isolated intracellular invaded cells to elucidate invasion programs of epithelial cell subsets. In particular, we identified a Salmonella-specific infection signature comprised of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including the Defensin gene family. Our findings demonstrate that Salmonella enterica targets differentiated Paneth, enterocytes, and stem/progenitor cells at these early stages of infection. In response, a rapid Lg5+ ISC-driven cellular remodeling to enterocyte and Paneth lineages expressing AMP genes is initiated to combat the intruders. Importantly, we uncovered an ISC differentiation program via inflammasome activation to protect the crypt environment, while eliminating infected stem cells from the overall stem cell pool. This novel Lgr5+ stem cell defense mechanism not only protects the gut epithelium from persistent bacterial infection but also promotes tissue regeneration. We propose epithelial remodeling to AMP-secreting cells as a novel innate immune response to handle different gut stresses mediated by Lgr5+ ISCs to maintain organizational principles of gut homeostasis and physiology.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

Here, we extensively validate a combination of scRNA-seq profiling and matching flow cytometry isolation that reproducibly identifies 7 key CM and Endo populations across mouse strains and accurately surveys both niche locations. We demonstrate that different perturbations exert specific effects on different compartments, with type I interferon responses causing CM mesenchymal stromal cells to adopt an inflammatory phenotype associated with overproduction of chemokines modulating local monocyte dynamics in the surrounding microenvironment.

        <tr id="Understanding the initiation of T-helper (Th)-2 immunity is crucial for addressing allergic diseases that have been linked to the commensal microbiota. However, Th2 responses are notably absent from known host-microbiota intestinal immune circuits. Notably, the commensal protist Tritrichomonas induces a transient innate ILC2 circuit rather than a chronic Th2 circuit. Canonical Th2 responses rely on the induction of IL-4 production by innate cells. This study shows that the absence of Tet2, a DNA demethylase, reprograms naïve T cells to autonomously produce IL-4 upon T cell receptor stimulation, bypassing the need for IL-4 from innate cells for Th2 differentiation. Loss of this checkpoint induces chronic Th2 responses to Tritrichomonas, associated with IL-25-dependent barrier dysfunction and increased susceptibility to allergic pathology in response to dietary antigens. Sentence Summary Regulation of cell autonomous IL-4 in T cells is critical to prevent dysregulated Th2 immunity to commensals and predisposition to allergy.">

        <tr id="Background and objectives: Immunotherapies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 are key components of the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC). However, they have distinct safety profiles and resistance to treatment can occur. We assess soluble TIM-3 (sTIM-3) in the plasma of mccRCC patients as a potential theranostic biomarker, as well as its source and biological significance. Methods: We analyzed the association of sTIM-3 with overall survival (OS), tumor response, and common clinical and biological factors across two mccRCC cohorts treated with anti-PD-1 (n = 27), anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 (n = 124). The origin and role of sTIM-3 are studied on tumor and blood samples, using multiplex immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry as well as a syngeneic tumor model with antitumor vaccination. We also reanalyzed publicly available single-cell transcriptomic (scRNAseq) data and mass cytometry data. Key findings and limitations: sTIM-3 is elevated in the plasma of patients with mccRCC and shows distinct associations with survival on anti-PD-1 vs anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4. sTIM-3 is independent from other clinical and biological factors. Myeloid immune cells appear as the prominent source of sTIM-3, which may indicate their dysfunctional role in the antitumor immune response. Future investigations are warranted in patients treated with anti-PD-1 + antiangiogenic therapies. Further functional studies are needed to confirm its theranostic value and clarify its role in the immune response. Conclusions and clinical implications: sTIM-3 appears to be a promising biomarker for optimizing treatment strategies in ccRCC as well as a potential therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="The interaction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with T cells within G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts in patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains to be elucidated. Through studying allo- and auto-PBSC grafts, we observed grafts containing large numbers of T cells and MDSCs with intergraft variability in their percentage and number. T cells from autologous grafts compared to allografts expressed relative higher percentages of inhibitory receptors PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT and BTLA. Autograft T cells had decreased cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion, which supported the possible presence of T cell exhaustion. On the contrary, graft monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) expressed multiple inhibitory receptor ligands, including PD-L1, CD86, Galectin-9, HVEM and CD155. The expression of inhibitory receptor ligands on M-MDSCs was correlated with their corresponding inhibitory receptors on T cells in the grafts. Isolated M-MDSCs had the ability to suppress T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion and/or promote Treg expansion. Blocking the PD-L1-PD-1 signaling pathway partially reversed the functions of M-MDSCs. Taken together, our data indicated that T cells and M-MDSCs in PBSC grafts express complementary inhibitory receptor–ligand pairing, which may impact the quality of immune recovery and clinical outcome post transplantation.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

Depletion of CD8+ T cells showed that liver tumor-reactive CD8+ T failed to control liver tumors but was effective against subcutaneous tumors. Similarly, analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from patients showed a higher frequency of exhausted tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in liver metastasis compared to paired primary colon cancer. High-dimensional, multi-omic analysis combining proteomic CODEX and scRNA-seq data revealed enriched interaction of SPP1+ macrophages and CD8+ tumor-reactive T cells in profibrotic, alpha-SMA rich regions in the liver. Liver tumors grew less in Spp1-/- mice and the tumor-specific CD8+ T cells were less exhausted.

This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

Bregs exhibit a remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, rendering their unequivocal identification a challenging task. The lack of a universally accepted and exclusive surface marker set for Bregs across various studies contributes to inconsistencies in their categorization.

        <tr id="Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks hormone receptors and HER2 amplification, making it unresponsive to standard hormone or HER2-targeted therapies. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, their efficacy remains limited in tumors with minimal lymphocyte infiltration. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. Methods We designed a chimeric cytokine receptor (ChCR) that triggers STAT1 signaling upon stimulation with IL-10 or TGFβ, cytokines prevalent in the TME that typically drive immunosuppression. Human primary macrophages were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the ChCR, and changes in their phenotype, secretome, and transcriptome were analyzed following stimulation. The anti-tumoral activity of these reprogrammed macrophages was assessed using co-culture assays with 3D TNBC spheroids. Results ChCR expressing macrophages showed robust STAT1 activation in response to IL-10 or TGFβ stimulation, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype similar to IFNγ activation, as confirmed by phenotypic markers, and transcriptomic profiling. These ChCR-stimulated macrophages demonstrated significant anti-tumoral effects in 3D TNBC spheroids. Moreover, ChCR stimulation led to the upregulation of genes associated with good response to ICIs, among others CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines essential for lymphocyte recruitment. Secretion of CXCL10 was also confirmed by ELISA. Conclusion We successfully engineered a ChCR that reprograms TAMs within an IL-10- and TGFβ-rich environment, inducing an inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumoral activity. The expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 further supports lymphocyte recruitment, potentially facilitating greater lymphocyte infiltration and disrupting the immunosuppressive TME. This approach offers a promising strategy to improve immunotherapy outcomes in TNBC patients, particularly those with low immune cell infiltration, thereby addressing a critical unmet clinical need.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), are devastating diagnoses for patients and their families, as these tumors are difficult to fully remove with surgery and respond poorly to chemotherapy and radiation. Immunotherapy is a novel approach to treating cancer, as these therapies are intended to initiate robust antitumor immune responses. However, immunotherapy for GBM has largely been unsuccessful. It is hypothesized that one of the major contributors to immunotherapy failure in GBM patients is the number of immunosuppressive blockades present in these patients. Often, the GBM microenvironment is characterized as highly immunosuppressive due to GBM recruiting anti-inflammatory immune cells to the microenvironment and releasing immunosuppressive factors such as PD-L1. Additionally, treatment given to GBM patients, such as corticosteroids, is immunosuppressive. In this review, we outline potential blockades to immunotherapy success in GBM patients to highlight where new approaches to combatting this malignancy should be considered. Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor depicted by a cold tumor microenvironment, low immunogenicity, and limited effective therapeutic interventions. Its location in the brain, a highly immune-selective organ, acts as a barrier, limiting immune access and promoting GBM dissemination, despite therapeutic interventions. Currently, chemotherapy and radiation combined with surgical resection are the standard of care for GBM treatment. Although immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors, its observed success in extracranial tumors has not translated into a significant survival benefit for GBM patients. To develop effective immunotherapies for GBM, it is vital to tailor treatments to overcome the numerous immunosuppressive barriers that inhibit T cell responses to these tumors. In this review, we address the unique physical and immunological barriers that make GBM challenging to treat. Additionally, we explore potential therapeutic mechanisms, studied in central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS cancers, that may overcome these barriers. Furthermore, we examine current and promising immunotherapy clinical trials and immunotherapeutic interventions for GBM. By highlighting the array of challenges T cell-based therapies face in GBM, we hope this review can guide investigators as they develop future immunotherapies for this highly aggressive malignancy.">

        <tr id="Background Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a serious liver disease characterized by immune disorders, particularly effector T-cell overactivation. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (MSC-EV) treatment on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and liver injury in AIH. Methods The metabolic changes of CD4+ T cells were assayed in human AIH and mouse hepatitis models. The liver protective effect of MSC-EVs was evaluated by transaminase levels, liver histopathology and inflammation. The effect of MSC-EVs on the metabolic state of CD4+ T cells was also explored. Results Enhanced glycolysis (eg, ~1.5-fold increase in hexokinase 2 levels) was detected in the CD4+ T cells of AIH patient samples and mouse hepatitis models, whereas the inhibition of glycolysis decreased CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.8-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and AIH liver injury (~6-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EV treatment reduced CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.5-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and cytokine release (~5-fold decrease in IFN-γ levels) by reducing glycolysis (~3-fold decrease) while enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (~2-fold increase in maximal respiration) in such cells. The degree of liver damage in AIH mice was ameliorated after MSC-EV treatment (~5-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EVs carried abundant mitochondrial proteins and might transfer them to metabolically reprogram CD4+ T cells, whereas disrupting mitochondrial transfer impaired the therapeutic potency of MSC-EVs in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusion Disordered glucose metabolism promotes CD4+ T-cell activation and associated inflammatory liver injury in AIH models, which can be reversed by MSC-EV therapy, and this effect is at least partially dependent on EV-mediated mitochondrial protein transfer between cells. This study highlights that MSC-EV therapy may represent a new avenue for treating autoimmune diseases such as AIH.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Fungal pathogens are underappreciated causes of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In previous studies, we determined that a heat-killed, Cryptococcus neoformans fbp1-deficient strain (HK-fbp1) is a potent vaccine candidate. We determined that vaccination with HK-fbp1 confers protective immunity against lethal Cryptococcosis in an interferon γ (IFNγ)-dependent manner. In this study, we set out to uncover cellular sources and relevant targets of the protective effects of IFNγ in response to the HK-fbp1 vaccine. We found that early IFNγ production peaks at day 3 and that monocytes and neutrophils are important sources of this cytokine after vaccination. Neutralization of IFNγ at day 3 results in impaired CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and reduced differentiation into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC). In turn, depletion of CCR2+ cells prior to immunization results in impaired activation of IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells. Thus, monocytes are important targets of innate IFNγ and help promote further IFNγ production by lymphocytes. We employed monocyte-fate mapper and conditional STAT1 knockout mice to uncover that STAT1 activation in CD11c+ cells, including alveolar macrophages, Mo-DCs, and monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-Mac) is essential for HK-fbp1 vaccine-induced protection. Altogether, our aggregate findings suggest critical roles for innate cells as orchestrators of vaccine-induced protection against Cryptococcus infection. IMPORTANCE The number of patients susceptible to invasive fungal infections across the world continues to rise at an alarming pace yet current antifungal drugs are often inadequate. Immune-based interventions and novel antifungal vaccines hold the promise of significantly improving patient outcomes. In previous studies, we identified a Cryptococcus neoformans mutant strain (Fbp1-deficient) as a potent, heat-inactivated vaccine candidate capable of inducing homologous and heterologous antifungal protection. In this study, we used a combination of methods together with a cohort of conditional knockout mouse strains to interrogate the roles of innate cells in the orchestration of vaccine-induced antifungal protection. We uncovered novel roles for neutrophils and monocytes as coordinators of a STAT1-dependent cascade of responses that mediate vaccine-induced protection against invasive cryptococcosis. This new knowledge will help guide the future development of much-needed antifungal vaccines.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Cancer treatment has been rapidly transformed by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. However, many patients fail to respond, especially those with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting the existence of additional immune checkpoints that act through orthogonal mechanisms. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-7 and -9 are newly designated glycoimmune checkpoints that are abundantly expressed by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. We discovered that T cells express only basal levels of Siglec transcripts; instead, they acquire Siglec-7 and -9 from interacting myeloid cells in the TME via trogocytosis, which impairs their activation and effector function. Mechanistically, Siglec-7 and -9 suppress T cell activity by dephosphorylating T cell receptor (TCR)-related signaling cascades. Using sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry, we developed a ligand that binds to Siglec-7 and -9 with high-affinity and exclusive specificity. Using this ligand, we constructed a Siglec-7/9 degrader that targets membrane Siglec-7 and -9 to the lysosome for degradation. Administration of this degrader induced efficient Siglec degradation in both T cells and myeloid cells in the TME. We found that Siglec-7/9 degradation has a negligible effect on macrophage phagocytosis, but significantly enhances T cell anti-tumor immunity. The degrader, particularly when combined with anti-CTLA-4, enhanced macrophage antigen presentation, reshaped the TME, and resulted in long-lasting T cell memory and excellent tumor control in multiple murine tumor models. These findings underscore the need to consider exogenous checkpoints acquired by T cells in the TME when selecting specific checkpoint blockade therapy to enhance T cell immunity.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell-derived hematologic malignancy whose progression depends on active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Despite the spectacular efficacy of Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), resistance can develop in CLL patients, and alternative therapeutic strategies are therefore required. Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care and may be an attractive approach in this context. We speculated that characterizing the immune responses of CLL patients may highlight putative immunotherapeutic targets. Here, we used high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry to compare the distribution and phenotype of non-B-cell immune populations in the circulating blood of CLL patients treated with Ibrutinib displaying a complete response or secondary progression. Although no drastic changes were observed in the composition of their immune subsets, the Ibrutinib-resistant group showed increased cycling of CD8+ T cells, leading to their overabundance at the expense of dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of 11 different surface checkpoints was similar regardless of response status. Together, this suggests that CLL relapse upon Ibrutinib treatment may not lead to major alterations in the peripheral immune response.">

To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

Removing nociceptor neurons reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSCs) tumor infiltration in mouse models of head and neck carcinoma and melanoma. Carcinoma-released small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) attract nociceptive nerves to tumors. sEV-deficient tumors fail to develop in mice lacking nociceptor neurons. Exposure of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons to cancer sEVs elevated expression of Substance P, IL-6 and injury-related neuronal markers while treatment with cancer sEVs and cytotoxic CD8 T-cells induced an immunosuppressive state (increased exhaustion ligands and cytokines). Cancer patient sEVs enhanced DRG responses to capsaicin, indicating increased nociceptor sensitivity. Conditioned media from DRG and cancer cell co-cultures promoted expression of MDSC markers in primary bone marrow cells while DRG conditioned media together with cancer sEVs induced checkpoint expression on T-cells.

        <tr id="Drugs that eliminate senescent cells, senolytics, can be powerful when combined with pro-senescence cancer therapies. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen, we identify here SLC25A23 as a vulnerability of senescent cancer cells. Suppressing SLC25A23 disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis, impairs oxidative phosphorylation and interferes with redox signaling, leading to death of senescent cells. These effects can be replicated by salinomycin, a cation ionophore antibiotic. Salinomycin prompts a PANoptosis-like cell death in senescent cells, including apoptosis and two forms of immunogenic cell death: necroptosis and pyroptosis. Notably, we observed that salinomycin treatment or SLC25A23 suppression elevates reactive oxygen species, upregulating death receptor 5 via JNK pathway activation. We show that a combination of a DR5 agonistic antibody and salinomycin is a robust senolytic cocktail. We provide evidence that this drug combination provokes a potent NK and CD8+ T cell mediated immune destruction of senescent cancer cells, mediated by the pyroptotic cytokine IL18. Significance The efficacy of multiple cancer drugs is limited by the induction of senescence, which enables cancer cells to evade cell death. We uncover here a new selective vulnerability of senescent cancer cells and we show that this vulnerability can be targeted with a commonly-used antibiotic. We show that a combination of senescence-inducing therapy, combined with this antibiotic causes a highly immunogenic cell death phenotype that further stimulates potent immune destruction of senescent cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) greatly contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance of cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms and whether TAMs can be promising targets to overcome ICI resistance remain to be unveiled. Through integrative analysis of immune multiomics data and single‐cell RNA‐seq data (iMOS) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lymphotoxin β receptor (LTBR) is identified as a potential immune checkpoint of TAMs, whose high expression, duplication, and low methylation are correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

Outside of aging, systemic stress responses that induce corticosteroids (CS), or other insults such as radiation exposure, induce thymocyte apoptosis, resulting in a transient acute thymic involution with subsequent recovery occurring after cessation of the stimulus. Despite the increasing utilization of immunostimulatory regimens in cancer, effects on the thymus and naïve T cell output have not been well characterized. Using both mouse and human systems, the thymic effects of systemic immunostimulatory regimens, such as high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) with or without agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs and acute primary viral infection, were investigated. These regimens produced a marked acute thymic involution in mice, which correlated with elevated serum glucocorticoid levels and a diminishment of naïve T cells in the periphery. This effect was transient and followed with a rapid thymic “rebound” effect, in which an even greater quantity of thymocytes was observed compared to controls. Similar results were observed in humans, as patients receiving HD IL-2 treatment for cancer demonstrated significantly increased cortisol levels, accompanied by decreased peripheral blood naïve T cells and reduced T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a marker indicative of recent thymic emigrants. Mice adrenalectomized prior to receiving immunotherapy or viral infection demonstrated protection from this glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution, despite experiencing a substantially higher inflammatory cytokine response and increased immunopathology. Investigation into the effects of immunostimulation on middle aged (7-12 months) and advance aged (22-24 months) mice, which had already undergone significant thymic involution and had a diminished naïve T cell population in the periphery at baseline, revealed that even further involution was incurred. Thymic rebound hyperplasia, however, only occurred in young and middle-aged recipients, while advance aged not only lacked this rebound hyperplasia, but were entirely absent of any indication of thymic restoration. This coincided with prolonged deficits in naïve T cell numbers in advanced aged recipients, further skewing the already memory dominant T cell pool. These results demonstrate that, in both mice and humans, systemic immunostimulatory cancer therapies, as well as immune challenges like subacute viral infections, have the potential to induce profound, but transient, glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution and substantially reduced thymic output, resulting in the reduction of peripheral naive T cells. This can then be followed by a marked rebound effect with naïve T cell restoration, events that were shown not to occur in advanced-aged mice.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary T regulatory cells are specialized lymphocytes that prevent excessive immune responses, yet they can suppress beneficial anti-tumor immunity when infiltrating malignant tumors. Osteopontin, a versatile protein produced by various cells, including T lymphocytes, influences both inflammation-related diseases and cancer immunity. Its role in T regulatory cells, however, remains less explored. Our study examined the impact of osteopontin deficiency on T regulatory cells. We generated mice lacking osteopontin in these cells and observed impaired immune suppression capabilities, which resulted in increased tumor-fighting activity against melanoma. These findings emphasize osteopontin’s crucial role in T regulatory cell stability and functionality within the tumor microenvironment, providing valuable insights for developing new immunotherapeutic strategies. Abstract Foxp3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells represent the most highly immunosuppressive cell in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that halts effective anti-tumor immunity. Osteopontin (Opn), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycophosphoprotein, plays key roles in many types of immune-related diseases and is associated with cancer aggressiveness when expressed by tumor cells. However, its role in Foxp3Treg heterogeneity, function, and stability in the TME is poorly defined. We generated mice with a Foxp3-specific deletion of Opn and assessed the ability of Opn-deficient Tregs to suppress inflammation. As these mice aged, they developed a scurfy-like syndrome characterized by aberrant and excessive activation of effector T cells. We evaluated and further confirmed the reduced suppressive capacity of Opn-deficient Tregs in an in vivo suppression assay of colitis. We also found that mice with Opn-deficient Foxp3+ Tregs have enhanced anti-tumor immunity and reduced tumor burden, associated with an unstable Treg phenotype, paralleled by reduced Foxp3 expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Finally, we observed reduced Foxp3 and Helios expression in Opn-deficient Tregs compared to wild-type controls after in vitro activation. Our findings indicate that targeting Opn in Tregs reveals vigorous and effective ways of promoting Treg instability and dysfunction in the TME, facilitating anti-tumor immunity.">

In our review, we addressed the functional distinctions between Foxp3+Tregs and other T cells, highlighting their roles in autoimmune diseases and cancer. We uncovered the dual nature of Tregs: they prevented autoimmune diseases by maintaining self-tolerance while contributing to tumor evasion by suppressing anti-tumor immunity. This study underscored the potential for targeted therapeutic strategies, such as enhancing Treg activity to restore balance in autoimmune diseases or depleting Foxp3+Tregs to augment anti-tumor immune responses in cancer. These insights laid the groundwork for future research and clinical applications, emphasizing the critical role of Foxp3+Tregs in immune regulation and the advancement of next-generation immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Proliferating tumor cells take up glutamine for anabolic processes engendering glutamine deficiency in the tumor microenvironment. How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets – cDC1 and cDC2, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on Glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mTOR signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses. One Sentence Summary Type 1 conventional dendritic cells require glutamine to maintain their number in non-lymphoid tissue. Significance Immune evasion is a key hallmark of cancer; however, the underlying pathways are diverse, tumor-specific and not fully elucidated. Many tumor cells avidly import glutamine to support their anabolic needs, creating a glutamine-deficient tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, using mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, we show that glutamine depletion in TME leads to reduced type 1 conventional dendritic cells – a cell type that is critical for adaptive immune responses. This work is a paradigm for how tumor cell metabolism can regulate anti-tumor immune responses and will be foundational to future efforts targeting glutamine metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Smooth muscle cell (SMC) plasticity and phenotypic switching play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, but their role in tumorigenesis is unknown. We investigated whether and how SMC diversity and plasticity plays a role in tumor angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment. Methods and Results We use SMC-specific lineage-tracing mouse models and single cell RNA sequencing to observe the phenotypic diversity of SMCs participating in tumor vascularization. We find that a significant proportion of SMCs adopt a phenotype traditionally associated with macrophage-like cells. These cells are transcriptionally similar to ‘resolution phase’ M2b macrophages, which have been described to have a role in inflammation resolution. Computationally predicted by the ligand-receptor algorithm CellChat, signaling from BST2 on the surface of tumor cells to PIRA2 on SMCs promote this phenotypic transition; in vitro SMC assays demonstrate upregulation of macrophage transcriptional programs, and increased proliferation, migration, and phagocytic ability when exposed to BST2. Knockdown of BST2 in the tumor significantly decreases the transition towards a macrophage-like phenotype, and cells that do transition have a comparatively higher inflammatory signal typically associated with anti-tumor effect. Conclusion As BST2 is known to be a poor prognostic marker in multiple cancers where it is associated with an M2 macrophage-skewed TME, these studies suggest that phenotypically switched SMCs may have a previously unidentified role in this immunosuppressive milieu. Further translational work is needed to understand how this phenotypic switch could influence the response to anti-cancer agents and if targeted inhibition of SMC plasticity would be therapeutically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid malignancies arise in bone marrow microenvironments and shape these microenvironments in favor of malignant development. Immune suppression is one of the most important stages in myeloid leukemia progression. Leukemic clone expansion and immune dysregulation occur simultaneously in bone marrow microenvironments. Complex interactions emerge between normal immune system elements and leukemic clones in the bone marrow. In recent years, researchers have identified several of these pathological interactions. For instance, recent works shows that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), from bone marrow stromal cells contributes to immune dysregulation and the selective proliferation of JAK2V617F+ clones in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Moreover, inflammasome activation and sterile inflammation result in inflamed microenvironments and the development of myelodysplastic syndromes. Additional immune dysregulations, such as exhaustion of T and NK cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, and impairments in antigen presentation are common findings in myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the role of altered bone marrow microenvironments in the induction of immune dysregulations that accompany myeloid malignancies. We also consider both current and novel therapeutic strategies to restore normal immune system function in the context of myeloid malignancies.">

        <tr id="Background Immune therapies are emerging as a critical component of cancer treatment, capable of delivering durable and potentially curative responses. While CAR-T cell therapy has proven effective for hematological malignancies, it faces challenges in treating solid tumors due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and physical barriers hindering CAR-T cell infiltration. NK cells, particularly adaptive NK (aNK) cells, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization and their resistance to immunosuppressive environments. Purpose The study investigates the role of cytokines, specifically IL-21 and IL-15, in enhancing aNK cell expansion and activation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Methods Buffy coats and GBM TILs were collected from Karolinska Hospital. NK cells were isolated and expanded in vitro with IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines and feeder cells (K562 and K562E). Furthermore, tumor lysate was added in the cultures to boost memory responses in aNK cells. NK cell functionality, cytotoxicity, and phenotyping was assessed using flow cytometry and statistical analysis (t-test and two-way ANOVA) used to validate the results. Further animal model was used to validate the cytotoxicity capacities of these cells against GBM tumors using a zebrafish model. Results IL-21 drives the expansion of aNK better than IL-15 controls, data shown in PBMCs and TILs derived from GBM patients and IPLA OVCA patients. Additionally, the use of tumor lysate as a booster for restimulation further amplifies the cytotoxic capacity of aNK cells against autologous tumors. The zebrafish model validates this method, by decreasing the tumor size in zebrafish animals after 3 days of injection. Conclusion The results demonstrate that IL-21 is essential for the specific expansion of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. Additionally, tumor lysate significantly increases the cytotoxic efficacy of aNK cells upon restimulation with the same tumor cells. These findings suggest that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the specific expansion and activation of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. By optimizing the expansion protocol, this method aims to advance the clinical application of aNK cells in immunotherapies for solid tumors, offering a potential solution to the limitations faced by current CAR-T therapies.">

        <tr id="Ionizing radiation exposure can cause damage to diverse tissues and organs, with the hematopoietic system being the most sensitive. However, limited information is available regarding the radiosensitivity of various hematopoietic cell populations in the bone marrow due to the high heterogeneity of the hematopoietic system. In this study, we observed that granulocyte–macrophage progenitors, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and B cells within the bone marrow showed the highest sensitivity, exhibiting a rapid decrease in cell numbers following irradiation. Nonetheless, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and dendritic cells demonstrated a certain degree of radioresistance, with neutrophils exhibiting the most pronounced resistance. By employing single-cell transcriptome sequencing, we investigated the early responsive genes in various cell types following irradiation, revealing that distinct gene expression profiles emerged between radiosensitive and radioresistant cells. In B cells, radiation exposure led to a specific upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, suggesting a connection between these complexes and cell radiosensitivity. In neutrophils, radiation exposure resulted in fewer gene alterations, indicating their potential for distinct mechanisms in radiation resistance. Collectively, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity of radiosensitivity among the various bone marrow hematopoietic cell populations.">

Both BCC and cSCC represent a significant health burden, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. The immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of NMSC, making it a critical focus for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights key immunological targets in BCC and cSCC, with a focus on immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, which regulate T cell activity and contribute to immune evasion. This review also highlights anti-tumor immune cell subsets within the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and dendritic cells. Additionally, it examines the immunosuppressive elements of the TME, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as well as their roles in NMSC progression and resistance to therapy. Emerging strategies targeting these immune elements, such as monoclonal antibodies, are also discussed for their potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes. By elucidating the immunological landscape of BCC and cSCC and drawing comparisons to melanoma, this review highlights the transformative potential of immunotherapy in treating these malignancies.">

        <tr id="Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer remains a poorly understood disease with a high mortality rate. Although most patients respond to cytotoxic therapies, a majority will experience recurrence. This may be due to a minority of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells (CSC) that survive chemotherapy and are capable of repopulating heterogeneous tumors. It remains unclear how CSCs are supported in the tumor microenvironment (TME) particularly during chemotherapy exposure. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) make up half of the immune population of the ovarian TME and are known to support CSCs and contribute to cancer progression. TAMs are plastic cells that alter their phenotype in response to environmental stimuli and thus may influence CSC maintenance during chemotherapy. Given the plasticity of TAMs, we studied the effects of carboplatin on macrophage phenotypes using both THP1- and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)–derived macrophages and whether this supports CSCs and ovarian cancer progression following treatment. We found that carboplatin exposure induces an M1-like proinflammatory phenotype that promotes SOX2 expression, spheroid formation, and CD117+ ovarian CSCs, and that macrophage-secreted CCL2/MCP-1 is at least partially responsible for this effect. Depletion of TAMs during carboplatin exposure results in fewer CSCs and prolonged survival in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. This study supports a role for platinum-based chemotherapies in promoting a transient proinflammatory M1-like TAM that enriches for CSCs during treatment. Improving our understanding of TME responses to cytotoxic drugs and identifying novel mechanisms of CSC maintenance will enable the development of better therapeutic strategies for high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Significance: We show that chemotherapy enhances proinflammatory macrophage phenotypes that correlate with ovarian cancer progression. Given that macrophages are the most prominent immune cell within these tumors, this work provides the foundation for future translational studies targeting specific macrophage populations during chemotherapy, a promising approach to prevent relapse in ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, yet targeting them for therapeutic intervention has been discouraged due to the associated risk of infections. Thus, identification of neutrophil subsets and their involvement in inflammatory conditions is warranted for targeted therapeutic strategies. This study, through screening of surface proteins on neutrophils isolated from different tissue microenvironments, identified a distinct neutrophil subset, CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils, expressing Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). Interestingly, these Sca1pos neutrophils were more abundant in the liver than BM, blood, and lungs. Further analysis revealed that Sca1pos neutrophils are mature and activated with enhanced effector functions, including superoxide generation, phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. Tracing studies demonstrated ageing-independent characteristics of Sca1pos neutrophils. Remarkably, Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophils promote T cell proliferation through ROS, while inhibition of Sca-1 restores T cell proliferation and ROS generation. Intriguingly, inflammatory as well as metabolic cues induce the transition of conventional neutrophils (Sca1neg) to Sca1pos neutrophils and differentiation of progenitors (granulocyte monocyte progenitors, GMPs) into Sca1pos neutrophils. Furthermore, in vivo models of acute inflammation, peritonitis, and chronic inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exhibit an increase of Sca1pos neutrophils at inflammatory sites, while the pharmacological approach using NAC specifically mitigates the expansion of these pro-inflammatory neutrophils. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel subset of Sca1pos neutrophils with implications for inflammation. Significance Statement Neutrophilic inflammation remains the leading driver in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Targeting neutrophil populations remained un-recommended due to hampering the immunological functions of neutrophils. The heterogeneity of neutrophils provides the perspective to target altered neutrophil subsets, but subtle changes defining neutrophil subsets make it complex and ambiguous. Our study identified abundant expression of Sca1on distinct neutrophils under steady state and inflammation. Thus, we reported previously undefined Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophil subsets and elucidated their regulation. This study further established their involvement in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. This understanding may further pave the way toward targeting specific neutrophil subsets in pathologies characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. Graphical Abstract Highlights CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophil subset identified with <1% presence in BM and >40% frequency in the liver. These neutrophils are mature and activated, demonstrating enhanced effector functions. Sca1pos neutrophils promote T cell proliferation and display pro-inflammatory characteristics. Conventional Sca1neg neutrophils transition into Sca1pos neutrophils in response to inflammatory signals, while progenitors undergo differentiation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory models show the expansion of CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, with oncolytic adenoviruses showing power as immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic potential of an adenovirus construct expressing CXCL9, CXCL10, or IL-15 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor models. Our results demonstrated robust cytokine secretion upon viral treatment, suggesting effective transgene expression. Subsequent analysis using resistance-based transwell migration and microfluidic chip assays demonstrated increased T-cell migration in response to chemokine secretion by infected cells in both 2D and 3D cell models. Flow cytometry analysis revealed CXCR3 receptor expression across T-cell subsets, with the highest percentage found on CD8+ T-cells, underscoring their key role in immune cell migration. Alongside T-cells, we also detected NK-cells in the tumors of immunocompromised mice treated with cytokine-encoding adenoviruses. Furthermore, we identified potential immunogenic antigens that may enhance the efficacy and specificity of our armed oncolytic adenoviruses in ccRCC. Overall, our findings using ccRCC cell line, in vivo humanized mice, physiologically relevant PDCs in 2D and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in 3D suggest that chemokine-armed adenoviruses hold promise for enhancing T-cell migration and improving immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC. Our study contributes to the development of more effective ccRCC treatment strategies by elucidating immune cell infiltration and activation mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and highlights the usefulness of PDOs for predicting clinical relevance and validating novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Overall, our research offers insights into the rational design and optimization of viral-based immunotherapies for ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor with limited therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. Despite current treatments, the invasive nature of GBM often leads to recurrence. A promising alternative strategy is to harness the potential of the immune system against tumor cells. Our previous data showed that the BVax (B cell–based vaccine) can induce therapeutic responses in preclinical models of GBM. In this study, we aimed to characterize the antigenic reactivity of BVax-derived Abs and evaluate their therapeutic potential. We performed immunoproteomics and functional assays in murine models and samples from patients with GBM. Our investigations revealed that BVax distributed throughout the GBM tumor microenvironment and then differentiated into Ab-producing plasmablasts. Proteomics analyses indicated that the Abs produced by BVax had unique reactivity, predominantly targeting factors associated with cell motility and the extracellular matrix. Crucially, these Abs inhibited critical processes such as GBM cell migration and invasion. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of BVax-derived Abs for patients with GBM, pointing toward a novel direction for GBM immunotherapy.">

This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of CD4+GNLY+ T cells and their relationship with immune restoration. Single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell TCR sequencing, and flow cytometry were used to analyze the frequency, phenotypes, and function of CD4+GNLY+ T cells. Moreover, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect plasma cytokines production in patients. CD4+GNLY+ T cells were found to be highly clonally expanded, characterized by higher levels of cytotoxicity, senescence, P24, and HIV-1 DNA than CD4+GNLY− T cells. Additionally, the frequency of CD4+GNLY+ T cells increased after ART, and further increased in INRs, and were positively associated with the antiretroviral therapy duration in INR. Furthermore, increased IL-15 levels in INRs positively correlated with the frequency and senescence of CD4+GNLY+ T cells, suggesting that CD4+GNLY+ T cells may provide new insights for understanding the poor immune reconstitution of INRs. In conclusion, increased, highly clonally expanded, and senescent CD4+GNLY+ T cells may contribute to poor immune reconstitution in HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy is associated with profound changes in immunity. However, pregnancy-related respiratory immune adaptations in response to influenza infection and their impact on disease severity remain unclear. Here, we describe, in a preclinical model of mid-gestation pregnancy, a mechanism of enhanced host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) localized to the nasal cavity that limits viral replication and reduces the magnitude of intrapulmonary immune responses. Consequently, the pregnant mice show reduced pulmonary pathology and preserved airway function after IAV infection. The early restriction of viral replication is independent of type I interferon (IFN) but dependent on increased antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) driven by interleukin-17+ (IL-17+) γδ+ T cells within the nasal passages. This pathway of host defense against IAV infection in the upper airways during pregnancy restricts early viral infection and prevents virus dissemination into the lung supporting maternal fitness.">

        <tr id="Lung tumor-promoting environmental exposures and γherpesvirus infections are associated with Type 17 inflammation. To test the effect of γherpesvirus infection in promoting lung tumorigenesis, we infected mutant K-Ras-expressing (K-RasLA1) mice with the murine γherpesvirus MHV68 via oropharyngeal aspiration. After 7 weeks, the infected mice displayed a more than 2-fold increase in lung tumors relative to their K-RasLA1 uninfected littermates. Assessment of cytokines in the lung revealed that expression of Type 17 cytokines (Il-6, Cxcl1, Csf3) peaked at day 7 post-infection. These observations correlated with the post-infection appearance of known immune mediators of tumor promotion via IL-17A in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, Cd84, an immune cell marker mRNA, did not increase in MHV68-infected wild-type mice lacking lung tumors. Csf3 and Cxcl1 protein levels increased more in the lungs of infected K-RasLA1 mice relative to infected wild-type littermates. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the infected K-RasLA1 mice had increased Ly6Gdim/Ly6Chi immune cells in the lung relative to levels seen in uninfected control K-RasLA1 mice. Selective methylation of adenosines (m6A modification) in immune-cell-enriched mRNAs appeared to correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. These observations implicate γherpesvirus infection in lung tumor promotion and selective accumulation of immune cells in the lung that appears to be associated with m6A modification of mRNAs in those cells.">

Our understanding of the cytokine landscape of the TME, their interrelationships, and their impact on cancer development is still at its early stages. In this review, we aim to shed light on Interleukin (IL) -6, IL-9, and IL-10, a small group of JAK/STAT signaling-dependent cytokines harboring T cell-suppressive effects in the TME and summarize their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we will explore how advancements in scientific research can help us overcoming the obstacles posed by cytokines that suppress T cells in tumors, with the ultimate objective of stimulating further investigations for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract their tumor-promoting activities.">

        <tr id="T cells engineered to express chimeric-antigen receptors (CAR-T cells) can effectively control relapsed and refractory haematological malignancies in the clinic. However, the successes of CAR-T cell therapy have not been recapitulated in solid tumours due to a range of barriers such as immunosuppression, poor infiltration, and tumour heterogeneity. Numerous strategies are being developed to overcome these barriers, which include improving culture conditions and manufacturing protocols, implementing novel CAR designs, and novel approaches to engineering the T cell phenotype. In this review, we describe the various emerging strategies to improve CAR T cell therapy for solid tumours. We specifically focus on new strategies to modulate cell function and fate that have precipitated from the growing knowledge of transcriptional circuits driving T cell differentiation, with the ultimate goal of driving more productive anti-tumour T cell immunity. Evidence shows that enrichment of particular phenotypic subsets of T cells in the initial cell product correlates to improved therapeutic responses and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, T cell exhaustion and poor persistence are major factors limiting therapeutic efficacy. The latest preclinical work shows that targeting specific master regulators and transcription factors can overcome these key barriers, resulting in superior T cell therapeutic products. This can be achieved by targeting key transcriptional circuits promoting memory-like phenotypes or sustaining key effector functions within the hostile tumour microenvironment. Additional discussion points include emerging considerations for the field such as (i) targeting permutations of transcription factors, (ii) transient expression systems, (iii) tissue specificity, and (iv) expanding this strategy beyond CAR-T cell therapy and cancer.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint (IC) inhibition in glioblastoma (GBM) has not shown promising results in the last decade compared to other solid tumors. Several factors contributing to the lack of immunotherapy response include the profound immunosuppressive nature of GBM, highly redundant signaling pathways underlying immune checkpoints, and the negative immunogenic impact of current standard of care on the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we will discuss various ICs in the context of GBM, their interplay with the tumor immune microenvironment, relevant pre-clinical and clinical studies, and the impact of current treatment modalities on GBM IC blockade therapy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive ICs, and how they contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is critical in advancing IC inhibition therapy in GBM. Furthermore, revisiting current treatment modalities and their impact on the immune landscape is instrumental in designing future combinatorial therapies that may overcome treatment resistance.">

        <tr id="Background Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients. Conclusion The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Cytokine(s) pre-activation/licensing is an effective way to enhance the immunomodulatory potency of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Currently, IFN-γ licensing received the most attention in comparison with other cytokines. After licensing human bone marrow-derived MSCs with pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β1 alone or in combination, the in-vitro immunomodulatory potency of these MSCs was studied by incubating with allogeneic T cells and macrophage-like THP-1 cells. In addition, immunomodulation-related molecules filtered by bioinformatics, complement 1 subcomponent (C1s) and interferon-induced GTP-binding protein Mx2 (MX2), were studied to verify whether to reflect the immunomodulatory potency. Herein, we reported that different cytokines cause different effects on the function of MSC. While TGF-β1 licensing enhances the capacity of MSCs to induce T cells with an immunosuppressive phenotype, IFN-γ-licensing strengthens the inhibitory effect of MSC on T cell proliferation. Both TGF-β1 and IFN-γ licensing can enhance the effect of MSC on reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by M1 macrophage-like THP-1 cells. Interestingly, IFN-γ upregulates potential potency markers extracellular C1s and kynurenine (KYN) and intracellular MX2. These three molecules have the potential to reflect mesenchymal stromal cell immunomodulatory potency. In addition, we reported that there is a synergistic effect of TGF-β1 and IFN-γ in immunomodulation.">

        <tr id="The chemokine CCL28 is highly expressed in mucosal tissues, but its role during infection is not well understood. Here, we show that CCL28 promotes neutrophil accumulation in the gut of mice infected with Salmonella and in the lung of mice infected with Acinetobacter. Neutrophils isolated from the infected mucosa expressed the CCL28 receptors CCR3 and, to a lesser extent, CCR10, on their surface. The functional consequences of CCL28 deficiency varied between the two infections: Ccl28−/− mice were highly susceptible to Salmonella gut infection but highly resistant to otherwise lethal Acinetobacter lung infection. In vitro, unstimulated neutrophils harbored pre-formed intracellular CCR3 that was rapidly mobilized to the cell surface following phagocytosis or inflammatory stimuli. Moreover, CCL28 stimulation enhanced neutrophil antimicrobial activity, production of reactive oxygen species, and formation of extracellular traps, all processes largely dependent on CCR3. Consistent with the different outcomes in the two infection models, neutrophil stimulation with CCL28 boosted the killing of Salmonella but not Acinetobacter. CCL28 thus plays a critical role in the immune response to mucosal pathogens by increasing neutrophil accumulation and activation, which can enhance pathogen clearance but also exacerbate disease depending on the mucosal site and the infectious agent.">

        <tr id="Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical highly heterogeneous solid tumor with high morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in China; however, the immune microenvironment of HCC has not been clarified so far. Here, we employed single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) on diethylnitrosamine (DEN)‐induced mouse HCC model to dissect the immune cell dynamics during tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal distinct immune profiles in both precancerous and cancerous lesions, indicating early tumor‐associated immunological alterations. Notably, specific T and B cell subpopulations are preferentially enriched in the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of naïve B cells with high CD83 expression, correlating with improved prognosis in human HCC. These signature genes were validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas HCC RNA‐seq dataset. Moreover, cell interaction analysis revealed that subpopulations of B cells in both mouse and human samples are activated and may potentially contribute to oncogenic processes. In summary, our study provides insights into the dynamic immune microenvironment and cellular networks in HCC pathogenesis, with a specific emphasis on naïve B cells. These findings emphasize the significance of targeting TME in HCC patients to prevent HCC pathological progression, which may give a new perspective on the therapeutics for HCC.">

        <tr id="Reduced responsiveness of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) to chemotherapy can be first detected in the form of minimal residual disease leukemia cells that persist after 28 days of initial treatment. The ability of these cells to resist chemotherapy is partly due to the microenvironment of the bone marrow, which promotes leukemia cell growth and provides protection, particularly under these conditions of stress. It is unknown if and how the glycocalyx of such cells is remodelled during the development of tolerance to drug treatment, even though glycosylation is the most abundant cell surface post-translational modification present on the plasma membrane. To investigate this, we performed omics analysis of BCP-ALL cells that survived a 30-day vincristine chemotherapy treatment while in co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells. Proteomics showed decreased levels of some metabolic enzymes. Overall glycocalyx changes included a shift from Core-2 to less complex Core-1 O-glycans, and reduced overall sialylation, with a shift from α2-6 to α2-3 linked Neu5Ac. Interestingly, there was a clear increase in bisecting complex N-glycans with a concomitant increased mRNA expression of MGAT3, the only enzyme known to form bisecting N-glycans. These small but reproducible quantitative differences suggest that individual glycoproteins become differentially glycosylated. Glycoproteomics confirmed glycosite-specific modulation of cell surface and lysosomal proteins in drug-tolerant BCP-ALL cells, including HLA-DRA, CD38, LAMP1 and PPT1. We conclude that drug-tolerant persister leukemia cells that grow under continuous chemotherapy stress have characteristic glycotraits that correlate with and perhaps contribute to their ability to survive and could be tested as neoantigens in drug-resistant leukemia.">

        <tr id="In sepsis, the liver functions as a central filter organ, where hepatic macrophages form a primary antimicrobial defense layer by eliminating bacteria and regulating immune responses. Therefore, precise regulation of the immune response in hepatic macrophages is crucial for triggering effective defense mechanisms. We aim to modulate the defense immune response by delivering transcription factor HIF1α, a key regulator of monocyte/macrophage reprogramming in sepsis. Transcription factors are promising candidates because they dynamically modulate gene expression across diverse conditions, though delivering them remains challenging. In this study, we suggest a novel method for loading HIF1α into extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance immune defense and resolve sepsis. By delivering HIF1α to macrophages during sepsis, we promoted the differentiation of Nr1h3-dependent pro-efferocytic MoMFs and C/ebpβ-dependent pro-survival MoMFs. Pro-efferocytic MoMFs eliminate damaged hepatocytes and immune cells and pro-survival MoMFs withstand inflammatory conditions and trigger innate memory responses. Particularly, the zonation of these macrophages in the periportal region ensures effective pathogen clearance and minimizes tissue damage. These findings suggest that EV-mediated HIF1α delivery could be a promising therapeutic option for managing sepsis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a kinase expressed by various immune cells and is often activated under proinflammatory states. Although the majority of BTK-related research has historically focused on B cells, understanding the role of BTK in non-B cell populations is critical given myeloid cells also express BTK at comparable levels. In this study, we investigated and compared how BTK inhibition in human and murine myeloid cells alters cell phenotype and function. All experiments were performed using two BTK inhibitors (evobrutinib and tolebrutinib) that are currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Assays were performed to assess the impact of BTK inhibition on cytokine and microRNA expression, phagocytic capacity, and cellular metabolism. In all cells, both evobrutinib and tolebrutinib significantly decreased phosphorylated BTK and LPS-induced cytokine release. BTK inhibition also significantly decreased the oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in myeloid cells, and significantly decreased phagocytosis in murine-derived cells, but not human macrophages. To further elucidate the mechanism, we also investigated the expression of microRNAs known to impact the function of myeloid cells. BTK inhibition resulted in an altered microRNA expression profile (i.e., decreased miR-155-5p and increased miR-223-3p), which is consistent with a decreased proinflammatory myeloid cell phenotype. In summary, these results provide further insights into the mechanism of action of BTK inhibitors in the context of immune-related diseases, while also highlighting important species-specific and cell-specific differences that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results between preclinical and human studies.">

We observed that acute blood loss forces the differentiation of murine erythroid cells in both bone marrow and spleen and that there was an up-regulation of several immune response genes, in particular pathogen-associated molecular pattern sensing gene Clec5a in post-acute blood loss murine bone marrow erythroid cells. We believe that the up-regulation of the Clec5a gene in bone marrow erythroid cells could help bone marrow erythroid cells detect and eliminate pathogens with the help of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial proteins calprotectin and cathelicidin, the genes of which (S100a8, S100a9, and Camp) dominate the expression in bone marrow erythroid cells of mice.">

        <tr id="Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a tiny structure that contains multiple immune cell components around tumor cells, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis, and is also the potential core area of activated immunotherapy. How immune cells with tumor-killing capacity in TIME are hijacked by tumor cells during the progression of tumorigenesis and transformed into subpopulations that facilitate cancer advancement is a question that needs to be urgently addressed nowadays. γδ T cells (their T cell receptors are composed of γ and δ chains), a unique T cell subpopulation distinguished from conventional αβ T cells, are involved in a variety of immune response processes through direct tumor-killing effects and/or indirectly influencing the activity of other immune cells. However, the presence of γδ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in some tumors, suggesting that certain γδ T cell subsets may also have pro-tumorigenic effects. Recent studies have revealed that metabolic pathways such as activation of glycolysis, increase of lipid metabolism, enhancement of mitochondrial biosynthesis, alterations of fatty acid metabolism reshape the local TME, and immune cells trigger metabolic adaptation through metabolic reprogramming to meet their own needs and play the role of anti-tumor or immunosuppression. Combining previous studies and our bioinformatics results, we hypothesize that γδT cells compete for resources with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by means of fatty acid metabolic regulation in the TME, which results in the weakening or loss of their ability to recognize and kill HCC cells through genetic and epigenetic alterations, thus allowing γδT cells to be hijacked by HCC cells as a subpopulation that promotes HCC progression.">

        <tr id="Melanoma, the most aggressive type of skin cancer with a high mutation rate, is the fifth most common cancer among Caucasians. Despite advancements in treatments like immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, over 40% of patients experience immune-related side effects, presenting significant challenges. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) has become an essential target in cancer therapy due to its overexpression in various cancers, where it enhances regulatory T cell (Treg) function and supports tumor growth, often leading to poor outcomes. This study investigated the effects of NRP1 inhibition in B16-F10 melanoma and its impact on immune responses regulated by Tregs. NRP1 was overexpressed in several cancers, including B16-F10 cells, compared to non-cancerous NIH-3T3 cells. Inhibiting NRP1 selectively caused apoptosis in B16-F10 cells without affecting NIH-3T3 cells. It also reversed the immunosuppression of splenic T cells induced by B16-F10-conditioned media, reducing Treg markers (NRP1, NKG2A, FOXP3), Treg activity, and the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-17A). Furthermore, NRP1 inhibition increased T cell proliferation and boosted the release of effector cytokines (TNF, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-2). NRP1 inhibition also suppressed the STAT, ERK MAPK, and Smad2/3 pathways while activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In splenic T cells from B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with an NRP1 inhibitor, there was a decrease in Treg markers and activity, along with enhanced T cell proliferation. Additionally, NRP1 inhibitor treatment reduced lung metastasis, decreased tumor size, and improved survival in these mice. This study shows that inhibiting NRP1 may slow B16-F10 melanoma progression and reduce Treg-mediated immunosuppression. This suggests its potential as a promising approach in future cancer immunotherapies, especially in combination with other treatments.">

Here, we show that mature IL-18 is generated in the thymus following numerous distinct forms of tissue damage, all of which cause caspase-1-mediated immunogenic cell death. We report that IL-18 stimulated cytotoxic NK cells limit endogenous thymic regeneration, a critical process that ensures restoration of immune competence after acute insults like stress, infection, chemotherapy, and radiation. NK cells suppressed thymus recovery by aberrantly targeting thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which act as the master regulators of organ function and regeneration. Together these studies reveal a novel pathway regulating tissue regeneration in the thymus and offer IL-18 as a potential therapeutic target to boost thymic function. Moreover, given the enthusiasm for IL-18 as a cancer immunotherapy for its capacity to elicit a type-1 immune response, these findings also offer insight into potential off-target effects.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) make major contributions to immune homeostasis. Because Treg dysfunction can lead to both allo- and autoimmunity, there is interest in correcting these disorders through Treg adoptive transfer. Two of the central challenges in clinically deploying Treg cellular therapies are ensuring phenotypic stability and maximizing potency. Here, we describe an approach to address both issues through the creation of OX40 ligand (OX40L)–specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–Tregs under the control of a synthetic forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) promoter. The creation of these CAR-Tregs enabled selective Treg stimulation by engagement of OX40L, a key activation antigen in alloimmunity, including both graft-versus-host disease and solid organ transplant rejection, and autoimmunity, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. We demonstrated that OX40L–CAR-Tregs were robustly activated in the presence of OX40L-expressing cells, leading to up-regulation of Treg suppressive proteins without induction of proinflammatory cytokine production. Compared with control Tregs, OX40L–CAR-Tregs more potently suppressed alloreactive T cell proliferation in vitro and were directly inhibitory toward activated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). We identified trogocytosis as one of the central mechanisms by which these CAR-Tregs effectively decrease extracellular display of OX40L, resulting in decreased DC stimulatory capacity. OX40L–CAR-Tregs demonstrated an enhanced ability to control xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease compared with control Tregs without abolishing the graft-versus-leukemia effect. These results suggest that OX40L–CAR-Tregs may have wide applicability as a potent cellular therapy to control both allo- and autoimmune diseases. Human FOXP3 promoter–driven OX40L–CAR-Tregs potently suppress alloreactivity and control graft-versus-host disease. Editor’s summary Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapies have emerged as a promising approach for diseases ranging from autoimmunity to transplantation, but delivery of a mixed pool of Tregs has not proven consistently successful. To make an improved Treg-based therapy, Rui et al. developed OX40L–CAR-Tregs, where expression of an OX40 ligand (OX40L)–specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is expressed only in Tregs that have turned on the master Treg transcription factor FoxP3. The authors showed that OX40L–CAR-Tregs outperformed control, standard Tregs in their ability to suppress effector T cells, in part through their ability to strip OX40L from the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In vivo, OX40L–CAR-Tregs were able to suppress development of graft-versus-host disease without an obvious detrimental effect on the antileukemia response, supporting further development of this potent cellular therapy. —Courtney Malo">

This review outlines the historical background, classification, and diversity of IM, elucidating its pivotal roles in oncogenicity, cancer development, and progression, alongside its influence on anti-tumor immunity. The signaling pathways through which IM impacts tumorigenesis and immunity, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), β-catenin, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and other pathways [NF-κB, Toll-like receptor (TLR), complement, RhoA/ROCK, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)], are discussed comprehensively. Furthermore, we briefly introduce the clinical implications of IM, emphasizing its potential as a target for novel cancer therapies, diagnostic biomarkers, and prognostic indicators. Notably, microbe-based therapeutic strategies such as fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT), probiotics regulation, bacteriotherapy, bacteriophage therapy, and oncolytic virotherapy are highlighted. These strategies hold promise for enhancing the efficacy of current cancer treatments and warrant further exploration in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignancy with significant immunosuppressive properties and limited immune activation. This immunosuppression is linked to reduced cytotoxic T-cell activity, impaired antigen presentation, and elevated levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. Studies demonstrate that cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration correlates with improved survival, while increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with worse outcomes and therapeutic resistance. Th1 cells are beneficial, whereas Th17 cells, producing interleukin-17 (IL-17), contribute to tumor progression. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3 are also linked to advanced stages of PCa. Chemotherapy holds promise in converting the "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) to a "hot" one by depleting immunosuppressive cells and enhancing tumor immunogenicity.


SUMMARY
This comprehensive review examines the immune microenvironment in PCa, focusing on the intricate interactions between immune and tumor cells in the TME. It highlights how TAMs, Tregs, cytotoxic T cells, and other immune cell types contribute to tumor progression or suppression and how PCa's low immunogenicity complicates immunotherapy.


KEY MESSAGES
The infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Th1 cells correlates with better outcomes, while elevated Tregs and TAMs promote tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance. TANs and NK cells exhibit dual roles, with higher NK cell levels linked to better prognoses. Immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM-3 are associated with advanced disease. Chemotherapy can improve tumor immunogenicity by depleting Tregs and MDSCs, offering therapeutic promise.">

To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Antigen-specific humoral responses are orchestrated through complex interactions among immune cells in lymphoid tissues, including the collaboration between B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Accumulating evidence indicates a crucial role for interleukin-9 (IL-9) in the formation of germinal centers (GCs), enhancing the generation of class-switched high-affinity antibodies. However, the exact function of IL-9 in Tfh cell regulation remains unclear. In this study, we examined the humoral immune responses of CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice, which lack an IL-9-specific receptor in Tfh cells. Upon intraperitoneal immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice displayed diminished levels of SRBC-specific IgG antibodies in their sera, along with reduced levels of GC B cells and plasma cells. Notably, Il9ra-deficient Tfh cells in the spleen exhibited decreased expression of their signature molecules such as B-cell lymphoma 6, C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, IL-4, and IL-21 compared to control mice. In models of allergic asthma induced by house dust mite (HDM) inhalation, CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice failed to elevate serum levels of HDM-specific IgE and IgG. This was accompanied by reductions in Tfh cells, GC B cells, and plasma cells in mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were identified as producers of IL-9 under immunizing conditions, possibly induced by leukotrienes released by activated IgD+ B cells around the T-B border. These observations may indicate the critical role of IL-9 receptor signaling in the activation of Tfh cells, with ILC2s potentially capable of supplying IL-9 in organized lymphoid tissues.">

        <tr id="Lifelong hematopoiesis is sustained by crosstalk between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and specialized bone marrow niches. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) upends that balance, as leukemic blasts secrete factors that remodel the bone marrow into a self-reinforcing leukemic niche. The inflammatory secretome behind this compartmental adaptation accounts for a progressive decline in hematopoietic function that leads to diagnosis and persists through early treatment. Not surprisingly, the mediators of an acute inflammatory injury and HSPC suppression have attracted much attention in an effort to alleviate morbidity and improve outcomes. HSPCs typically recover during disease remission and re-expand in the bone marrow (BM), but little is known about potentially lasting consequences for stem cells and progenitors. We recently showed that AML-experienced HSPCs actively participate in the inflammatory process during leukemic progression. HSPCs are constituent components of the innate immune system, and elegant studies of infection and experimental inflammation over the past decade have described the generation of an adoptively transferable, innate immune memory. Building on this paradigm, we discuss the potential translational relevance of a durable legacy in AML-experienced HSPC.">

        <tr id="Combination therapy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but many patients still have unsatisfactory outcomes. CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could “reprogram” intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore anti-tumor T-cell responses.



 Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.



 Mice with RRV-IRF8 pre-transduced intracerebral tumors had significantly longer survival and slower tumor growth compared to controls. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Further, intra-tumoral and cervical lymph node DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. To assess mechanism of action, mice were treated azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor. Untreated mice maintained a superior survival benefit, which demonstrated that viral replication through proliferating cells is necessary for tumor control. This showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME. Moreover, subset of mice with RRV-IRF8 treated tumors achieved complete tumor clearance and further rejected subcutaneous GBM tumors, indicating the presence of immunological memory.



 Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation in situ, achieving improved tumor control and conferring a significant survival benefit.

        <tr id="Abstract Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a primary immunodeficiency disease caused by mutations in exon 45 of the DOCK8 gene. The clinical signs primarily consist of increased serum IgE levels, eczema, repeated skin infections, allergies, and upper respiratory tract infections. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a DOCK8 exon 45 mutation in mice, mirroring the mutation found in patients. The results indicated that DOCK8 mutation impairs peripheral T cell homeostasis, disrupts regulatory T cells (Tregs) development, increases ICOS expression in Tregs within peripheral lymph nodes (pLn), and promotes Th17 cell differentiation within the spleen and pLn. Upon virus infection, DOCK8 mutation CD4+ T cells have a Th2 effector fate. RNA‐bulk sequencing data revealed alternations in the mTOR pathway of DOCK8 mutant CD4+ T cells. We observed that DOCK8 mutation upregulates the glycolysis levels in CD4+ T cells, which is related to the Akt/mTOR/S6/HIF‐1α pathway. In summary, our research elucidates that DOCK8 regulates the differentiation of helper T cells by modulating the glycolytic pathway in CD4+ T cells, thereby advancing the comprehension and offering potential treatment of diseases in DOCK8‐deficient patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are immunocompromised and highly vulnerable to serious recurrent infections. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are principal sensors of infection and are essential in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to resolve infection. This study identified significant deficiencies in six functionally distinct DC subsets in blood of untreated CLL (UT-CLL) patients and selective normalization of pDCs in response to acalabrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. DCs are continuously replenished from hematopoiesis in bone marrow (BM). Four BM developmental intermediates that give rise to cDCs and pDCs were examined and significant reductions of these were identified in UT-CLL patients supporting a precursor/progeny relationship. The deficiencies in blood DCs and BM DC progenitors were significantly associated with alterations in the Flt3/FL signaling pathway critical to DC development and function. Regarding clinical parameter, cDC subset deficiencies are associated with adverse prognostic indicators of disease progression, including IGHV mutation, CD49d, CD38, and ZAP-70 status. Importantly, UT-CLL patients with shared DC subset deficiencies had shorter time-to-first treatment (TTFT), uncovering a profound alteration in innate immunity with the potential to instruct therapeutic decision-making.">

        <tr id="Patients with chronic HBV infection (CHI) exhibit defective anti-viral immune-response whose underlying causes still remain unclear. Monocytes act as immune sentinels for pathogens and can regulate immunity via interaction with other immune-cells, apart from differentiating into macrophages. Immune-checkpoint molecules (ICMs) expressed by immune-cells, including monocytes are known to negatively regulate immune-responses. Here, we evaluated the expression of ICMs, namely, Gal-9, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 on monocytes in different phases of CHI, identified the viral and the host factors causing their aberrant expression and investigated their impact during interaction of monocytes with T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells and also on monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Influence of Tenofovir therapy on the expression of monocytic ICMs was also studied.Collection of blood and liver-tissue samples from HBV infected patients and controls, flow-cytometry, cell sorting, cell culture and immune-fluorescence were performed for this study.Gal-9+ and PD-L1+-monocytes were significantly increased in HBeAg-positive as well as HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients than healthy controls (HC). In immune-tolerant (IT) subjects, only Gal-9+-monocytes and in inactive carriers (IC), PD-L1+-monocytes were higher than HC while CTLA-4+-monocytes remained comparable among groups. High serum Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration in CHB as well as IT and TNF-α in CHB triggered monocytic Gal-9-expression whereas, PD-L1 was induced by elevated TNF-α and IL-4 in CHB and IL-1β in CHB and IC. Purified monocytes from CHB and IT having high Gal-9 expression led to expansion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+-Tregs, CD19+IL-10+-Bregs and CD19+CD27-CD21–atypical memory B-cells and these monocytes also preferentially differentiated into M2-macrophages. These phenomena were reversed by anti-Gal-9-antibody. Parallelly, PD-L1+-monocytes in CHB and IC reduced IL-2/IFN-γ and IL-6 production by HBV-specific T- and B-cells respectively, which were restored by anti-PD-L1-antibody. Both Gal-9+- and PD-L1+-monocytes caused decline in IFN-γ+-NK-cells but enhanced IL-10-expressing HBV-specific-T-cells and NK-cells. Increased intrahepatic CD14+Gal-9+ and CD14+PD-L1+-monocytes were noted in CHB patients than HC. One-year tenofovir therapy failed to reduce monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1 along with the levels of HBsAg, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4.Monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1, expressed heterogeneously in different phases of CHI, exert diverse inhibitory effects on immune-responses and their therapeutic targeting could boost anti-HBV immunity.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the area immediately surrounding a cancerous tumor that influences the tumor’s behavior and how the immune system reacts to it. Central to the TME environment are special immune cells—tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)—that, rather than restrict the tumor, actually facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, targeting these TAMs can help to eliminate cancer. In this article, we review the biology of TAMs and delve into the signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of macrophage phenotypes, their plasticity, and therapeutic implications. Abstract Within the tumor microenvironment, myeloid cells constitute a dynamic immune population characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype and diverse functional activities. In this review, we consider recent literature shedding light on the increasingly complex biology of M2-like immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including their contribution to tumor cell invasion and metastasis, stromal remodeling (fibrosis and matrix degradation), and immune suppressive functions, in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review also delves into the intricate signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of diverse macrophage phenotypes, and their plasticity. We also review the development of promising therapeutic approaches to target these populations in cancers. The expanding knowledge of distinct subsets of immunosuppressive TAMs, and their contributions to tumorigenesis and metastasis, has sparked significant interest among researchers regarding the therapeutic potential of TAM depletion or phenotypic modulation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation initiated by inflammatory monocytes underlies the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, approaches that can effectively resolve chronic low-grade inflammation targeting monocytes are not readily available. The small chemical compound 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) exhibits broad anti-inflammatory effects in reducing atherosclerosis. Selective delivery of 4-PBA reprogrammed monocytes may hold novel potential in providing targeted and precision therapeutics for the treatment of atherosclerosis. METHODS: Systems analyses integrating single-cell RNA sequencing and complementary immunologic approaches characterized key resolving characteristics as well as defining markers of reprogrammed monocytes trained by 4-PBA. Molecular mechanisms responsible for monocyte reprogramming were assessed by integrated biochemical and genetic approaches. The intercellular propagation of homeostasis resolution was evaluated by coculture assays with donor monocytes trained by 4-PBA and recipient naive monocytes. The in vivo effects of monocyte resolution and atherosclerosis prevention by 4-PBA were assessed with the high-fat diet-fed ApoE−/− mouse model with IP 4-PBA administration. Furthermore, the selective efficacy of 4-PBA-trained monocytes was examined by IV transfusion of ex vivo trained monocytes by 4-PBA into recipient high-fat diet-fed ApoE−/− mice. RESULTS: In this study, we found that monocytes can be potently reprogrammed by 4-PBA into an immune-resolving state characterized by reduced adhesion and enhanced expression of anti-inflammatory mediator CD24. Mechanistically, 4-PBA reduced the expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) via reducing peroxisome stress and attenuating SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase)-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. Concurrently, 4-PBA enhanced the expression of resolving mediator CD24 through promoting PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) neddylation mediated by TOLLIP (toll-interacting protein). 4-PBA-trained monocytes can effectively propagate anti-inflammation activity to neighboring monocytes through CD24. Our data further demonstrated that 4-PBA-trained monocytes effectively reduce atherosclerosis pathogenesis when administered in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes a robust and effective approach to generate resolving monocytes, characterizes novel mechanisms for targeted monocyte reprogramming, and offers a precision therapeutics for atherosclerosis based on delivering reprogrammed resolving monocytes.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity through their immunosuppressive function. There have been numerous reports confirming that high levels of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are associated with a poor prognosis, highlighting their role in promoting an immunosuppressive environment. In breast cancer (BC), Tregs interact with cancer cells, ultimately leading to the suppression of immune surveillance and promoting tumor progression. This review discusses the dual role of Tregs in breast cancer, and explores the controversies and therapeutic potential associated with targeting these cells. Researchers are investigating various strategies to deplete or inhibit Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine antagonists, and metabolic inhibition. However, the heterogeneity of Tregs and the variable precision of treatments pose significant challenges. Understanding the functional diversity of Tregs and the latest advances in targeted therapies is critical for the development of effective therapies. This review highlights the latest approaches to Tregs for BC treatment that both attenuate Treg-mediated immunosuppression in tumors and maintain immune tolerance, and advocates precise combination therapy strategies to optimize breast cancer outcomes.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with unclear pathogenesis and no effective treatments. We aimed to investigate a novel mechanistic theory and treat HAM patients with rituximab, which can deplete CD20+ B lymphocytes in circulation.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was analyzed to identify HTLV-1-associated B cells and their effect on T cells. An observational analysis of our HAM cohort was conducted to elucidate changes in the immunological microenvironment of these patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HAM patients were isolated to explore the efficacy of B cell depletion in vitro. To assess the effect of B-cell depletion on HAM patients, eligible participants in our cohort received rituximab therapy (NCT04004819).


RESULTS
ScRNA-seq results suggest a significant effect of HTLV-1-associated B cells on T cells. Additionally, HTLV-1 was found to infect B cells and depletion of B cells inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Number of B cells in HAM patients had positive correlation with the proviral load and infected cell counts. Depletion of B cells led to a reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load in vitro. Furthermore, in clinical trial, 14 HAM patients were enrolled. Three patients (21.4%) who received rituximab failed to achieve remission, compared to 24 (85.7%) patients received any other therapy that failed to achieve remission. With a low level of circulating B cells, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in CD4+ T cells fell.


INTERPRETATION
This study provided evidence that depleting B-lymphocytes is an innovative strategy for treating patients with HAM and broadens the understanding of the role of B cells in infectious immunity.">

 A major challenge in osteosarcoma (OS) immunotherapy is overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), to restore immune recognition and destruction of tumor cells. One of the key immune cell subsets known to contribute to the immunosuppressive TME are M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our work aims to identify novel oncolytic virus (OV) combination immunotherapies to induce direct lysis of OS tumor cells, activate immune-mediated destruction of OS, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME. The direct lytic activity of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV; HSV1716) treatment was assessed using LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry and viral replication was measured using standard plaque assay. NK cell degranulation and killing assays were performed by co-culture of OS cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated ± oHSV; NK cell degranulation and target cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. TAMs were generated in vitro by co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for 7 days. Phagocytosis assays were performed by co-culture of TAMs with OS cells using fluorescent cell tracker stains and flow cytometry. Multicellular spheroids were generated by co-culture of firefly luciferase-expressing OS cell lines with CD14+ monocytes and bone marrow derived MSCs for 7 days in low adhesion plates, viability of tumor cells after treatment was assessed by addition of d-luciferin and quantification of luminescence. Treatment of four OS cell lines with oHSV for 72 hours resulted in <20% cell death by direct lysis. However, after treatment with oHSV-GFP, >95% of OS cells were GFP+ and viral titer increased up to 105-fold when compared to viral input. This highlighted high levels of infection and replication of oHSV within OS cell lines, despite limited oncolysis. Moreover, oHSV treatment of PBMC significantly enhanced the immune-mediated killing of OS cell lines, and this was NK cell dependent. Monolayer co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or MSC generated TAMs with significantly increased pro-tumor M2-like phenotype (CD14+CD206+CD163+), when compared with PBMC cultured alone, and TAMs suppressed NK cell degranulation against OS cell lines. Treatment of TAMS with oHSV encoding GM-CSF reduced the proportion of M2 TAMs. Moreover, treatment of OS target cells with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) and co-culture with in vitro generated TAMs significantly increased their phagocytic activity. Multicellular spheroids incorporating MSCs and CD14+ monocytes displayed a high degree of resistance against immune-mediated killing, when compared with OS cell line alone as monolayer or spheroid cultures. However, combination of OV with anti-EGFR mAb significantly increased immune-mediated killing against multicellular spheroids. oHSV combination strategies with mAb may be a promising treatment strategy against OS, to exert direct oncolysis, stimulate immune-mediated destruction, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME.

        <tr id="Abstract Aims SARS‐CoV‐2 causes systemic immune dysfunction, leading to severe respiratory dysfunction and multiorgan dysfunction. Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) therapy is designed to regulate an excessive inflammatory response and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We aimed to investigate a targeted subset of granulocytes and monocytes to be removed after GMA therapy in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection. Methods We established an ex vivo experimental system to study the effects of GMA. Blood samples were collected into EDTA‐treated tubes and a mixture of blood samples and cellulose acetate beads was used in GMA. After GMA, blood samples were removed, and the granulocyte and monocyte subtypes before and after GMA were determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. To analyze mass cytometry data with a self‐organizing map, hierarchical clustering was used to determine the appropriate number of metaclusters from t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results We included seven patients with severe COVID‐19 and four age‐ and sex‐matched volunteers. Granulocyte subsets removed by GMA strongly expressed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b, and weakly expressed CD11c, consistent with mature and activated neutrophils. Monocyte subsets strongly expressed CD14, weakly expressed CD33 and CD45RO, and did not express CD16. These subsets were indicated to promote the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate T cells. Conclusions The identification of the granulocyte and monocyte subsets removed after GMA in patients with severe COVID‐19 may help explain the potential mechanism underlying the effectiveness of GMA in COVID‐19 and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant and influential elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME), giving support to tumor development in multiple ways. Among other mechanisms, CAFs are important regulators of immunological processes occurring in tumors. However, CAF-mediated tumor immunomodulation in the context of radiotherapy remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore effects of radiation on CAF-derived immunoregulatory signals to the TME. Methods Primary CAF cultures were established from freshly collected human NSCLC lung tumors. CAFs were exposed to single-high or fractionated radiation regimens (1x18Gy or 3x6Gy), and the expression of different immunoregulatory cell-associated and secreted signaling molecules was analyzed 48h and 6 days after initiation of treatment. Analyses included quantitative measurements of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), interferon (IFN) type I responses, expression of immune regulatory receptors, and secretion of soluble cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. CAFs are able to survive ablative radiation regimens, however they enter into a stage of premature cell senescence. Results Our data show that CAFs avoid apoptosis and do not contribute by release of DAMPs or IFN-I secretion to radiation-mediated tumor immunoregulation. Furthermore, the secretion of relevant immunoregulatory cytokines and growth factors including TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IL-1β, VEGF, CXCL12, and CXCL10 remain comparable between non-irradiated and radiation-induced senescent CAFs. Importantly, radiation exposure modifies the cell surface expression of some key immunoregulatory receptors, including upregulation of CD73 and CD276. Discussion Our data suggest that CAFs do not participate in the release of danger signals or IFN-I secretion following radiotherapy. The immune phenotype of CAFs and radiation-induced senescent CAFs is similar, however, the observed elevation of some cell surface immunological receptors on irradiated CAFs could contribute to the establishment of an enhanced immunosuppressive TME after radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Breast cancer represents one of the leading causes of death among women. Surgery can be effective, but once breast cancer has metastasized, it becomes extremely difficult to treat. Conventional therapies are associated with substantial toxicity and poor efficacy due to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance and disease relapse. Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade appears to offer limited benefit in breast cancer. The poor tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment result in scarce T-cell infiltration, leading to a low response rate. Thus, there is considerable interest in the development of improved active immunotherapies capable of sensitizing a patient’s immune system against tumor cells. Methods: We evaluated the in vitro anti-tumor activity of a personalized vaccine based on dendritic cells generated in the presence of interferon (IFN)-α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (IFN-DC) and loaded with an oxidized lysate from autologous tumor cells expanded as 3D organoid culture maintaining faithful tumor antigenic profiles. Results: Our findings demonstrate that stimulation of breast cancer patients’ lymphocytes with autologous IFN-DC led to efficient Th1-biased response and the generation in vitro of potent cytotoxic activity toward the patients’ own tumor cells. Conclusions: This approach can be potentially applied in association with checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy in the design of new combinatorial therapies for breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Over the last decades, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular for their roles in various pathologies, including cancer and neurological and immunological disorders. EVs have been considered for a long time as a means for normal cells to get rid of molecules it no longer needs. It is now well established that EVs play their biological roles also following uptake or by the interaction of EV surface proteins with cellular receptors and membranes. In this review, we summarize the current status of EV production and secretion in glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of glioma associated with high mortality. The main purpose is to shed light on the EVs as a universal mediator of interkingdom and intrakingdom communication in the context of tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. We focus on the immunomodulatory EV functions in glioblastoma-immune cross-talk to enhance immune escape and reprogram tumor-infiltrating immune cells. We critically examine the evidence that GBM-, immune cell-, and microbiome-derived EVs impact local tumor microenvironment and host immune responses, and can enter the circulatory system to disseminate and drive premetastatic niche formation in distant organs. Taking into account the current state of the art in intratumoral microbiome studies, we discuss the emerging role of bacterial EV in glioblastoma and its response to current and future therapies including immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to unprecedented success in treating relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The most common CAR-T cell products currently in the clinic for DLBCL differ in their co-stimulation moiety, containing either CD28 or 4-1BB, which initiate distinct signalling pathways. Previous work has highlighted the importance of T cell metabolism in fuelling anti-cancer function. We have studied the metabolic characteristics induced by CD28 versus 4-1BB co-stimulation in patient CAR-T cells ex vivo. Our data show that in patients, CD28 and 4-1BB drive significantly divergent metabolic profiles. CD28 signalling endows T cells with a preferentially glycolytic metabolism supporting an effector phenotype and increased expansion capacity, while 4-1BB co-stimulation preserves mitochondrial fitness and results in memory-like differentiation. Despite this divergent programming, T cells in patients responding successfully to therapy were metabolically similar, irrespective of co-stimulator, suggesting that efficient fuelling of CAR-T cells in lymphoma requires a ‘balanced’ metabolism. In contrast, CAR-T cells in non-responders were pushed to their metabolic extremes. One sentence summary CD28 and 4-1BB signalling drive divergent metabolic profiles in patient CAR-T cells, however patients that respond to therapy have CAR-T cells that maintain metabolic balance.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in resistance to immunotherapy. In this study, we identified epidermal growth factor-like 6 (Egfl6) as a new regulator of myeloid cell functions. Our analyses indicated that Egfl6, via binding with β3 integrins and activation of p38 and SYK signaling, acts as a chemotactic factor for myeloid cells migration and promotes their differentiation towards an immunosuppressive state. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer (OvCa), tumor expression of Egfl6 increased the intra-tumoral accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSCs and TAMs and their expression of immunosuppressive factors, including CXCL2, IL-10 and PD-L1. Consistent with this, in an immune 'hot' tumor model, Egfl6 expression eliminated response to a-PD-L1 therapy, while Egfl6 neutralizing antibody decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and PMN-MDSCs and restored the efficacy of a-PD-L1 therapy. Supporting a role in human tumors, in human OvCa tissue samples, areas of high EGFL6 expression co-localized with myeloid cell infiltration. scRNAseq analyses revealed a correlation between EGFL6 and immune cell expression of immunosuppressive factors. Our data provide mechanistic insights into the onco-immunologic functions of EGFL6 in mediating tumor immune suppression and identified EGFL6 as a potential novel therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy in OvCa patients.">

        <tr id="Live microfilariae (mf) and mf-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to modulate human antigen presenting cell (APC) function, most notably by suppressing the induction of IL-12 (and other pro-inflammatory cytokines) following activation with LPS and interferon-y. To explore further how EVs alter human APC function, we studied the effect of mf and EVs on human elutriated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) following exposure to Mf, mf-derived excretory/secretory (E/S) products, E/S depleted of EVs through ultracentrifugation and purified EVs.  After demonstrating that the measurable responses induced by live mf could be recapitulated by EVs and EV-containing E/S, we next performed RNAseq analysis of human DC following exposure to live mf, EVs, E/S, or EV-depleted E/S. In our analyses of the data for the DC, using a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05, EV-exposed DC had induced the expression of 212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when compared to unexposed DC and 157 when compared to E/S-depleted EVs.  These genes were enriched in GO biological processes associated with neutrophil degranulation and 15 DEGs associated with KEGG Lysosome pathways. IPA analysis point to immune dysregulation. We next aimed to understand the intracellular processes altered by EVs and the effect these have on effector T cells. When SARS CoV-2 Membrane-specific CD4+ TCLs were assessed following EV conditioning of autologous DC and activation with the SARS CoV-2-Membrane peptide pool, we found conditioning reduced the frequency of SARS CoV-2 Membrane-specific CD3+ CD4+ CD154+ cells (p=.015). Similarly, EV-conditioning of SARS CoV-2 Membrane-specific CD3+ CD4+ cells induced fewer cell capable of producing IFN-γ (p=.045). Taken together, our data suggest a modulatory role of EVs on APC function that likely leads to defects in T cell effector function.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular events seem to occur more frequently after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests a possible role of immune checkpoints in accelerating atherosclerosis formation. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of soluble and membrane-bound immune checkpoints in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We assessed the levels of 14 soluble immune checkpoints in fasting blood plasma of PAD patients (intermittent claudication, n= 37) and healthy controls (HCs, n=39) by Multiplex protein assay. We measured the levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1/2), B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), glucocorticoid-induced TNRF-related protein (GITR), herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), CD28, CD27, CD80, CD137 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). The surface expression of CD28, PD-L2, PD-1, GITR, LAG-3, TIM-3 and BTLA on peripheral blood immune cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine production capacity was measured by flow cytometry in TIM-3+ T cells to determine immune exhaustion. Soluble levels of PD-L2 were decreased in PAD patients, but only in females, whereas soluble levels of TIM-3 showed a trend towards increased concentration in female PAD patients. All monocyte subsets had increased frequencies of PD-L2+ cells in PAD patients. CD4+ T cells had increased frequencies of TIM-3+ cells, which showed little overlap with other immune exhaustion markers. TIM-3+ CD4+ T cells appeared to have a low capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, but a higher capacity to produce IL-10 compared to TIM-3-CD4+ T cells. We found that PAD patients show differences in expression of both membrane-bound and soluble immune checkpoints. Some of these differences might be caused by prolonged immune activation, although immune exhaustion markers did not always overlap.">

        <tr id="Tumors often evolve to engage numerous strategies to circumvent detection by the immune system. Our group recently discovered elevated neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (nsGSL) surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors. We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNγ, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression. These data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the GSL pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsGSL levels.">

In a tissue culture model of the blood–brain barrier, antagonizing the interaction of CD200 and sCD200 with T-cell CD200 receptor (CD200R1) via anti-CD200 blocking antibodies or the RNAi-mediated inhibition of CD200 production by endothelial cells increased T-cell adhesion and transmigration across monolayers of endothelial cells.

 Background: Identification of effective immunomodulatory strategies remains a major unmet need in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (aCD40) exhibits direct cytotoxicity on tumor cells and augments antigen presentation. Subasumstat(SUB), a sumoylation inhibitor, augments innate and adaptive immune responses by increasing interferon signaling. We hypothesized that SUB+aCD40 combination would promote an effective antitumor immune response in an aggressive orthotopic model of PDAC. Methods: 2000 KPC 46 cells were implanted in the pancreas of four groups of F1 hybrid (initial survival, CD8+ T-cell depletion, and clodronate liposome depletion) and nude mice, enrolled when tumors had reached 3-5mm. The vehicle (veh) group received 80ul SUB vehicle (q48 hrs) and 100 ug blank IgG (qwk); SUB only group received 15mg/kg q48h; aCD40 only group received 100ug qwk; SUB+aCD40 group received 15mg/kg SUB q48h and 100 ug aCD40 qwk. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) was conducted on n=2 tumors from each group. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on veh and SUB+aCD40 tumors for macrophage infiltration using F4/80. Flow cytometry (FC) was employed for the presence of lymphoid and myeloid markers in veh, SUB+aCD40, and clodronate depleted SUB+aCD40 (SUB+aCD40+clod) groups. Results: Mice receiving SUB+aCD40 had a significantly improved median survival over those receiving monotherapy or vehicle (24.5d vs. SUB:15.5d, aCD40:20d, veh: 19d). scRNASeq revealed increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell and myeloid populations when comparing veh and monotherapy to SUB+aCD40. F4/80 IHC confirmed increased macrophage infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (p = 0.01). The survival advantage conferred by SUB+aCD40 was preserved in both CD8+ T-cell depleted mice (p=0.025) and nude mice (p=0.037), while clodronate eliminated the treatment survival advantage (p=0.39). FC showed increased tumor macrophage/monocyte infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (veh:11.9%, SUB+aCD40:22.5%, p=0.03) and reduction in SUB+aCD40+clod (12.6%, p=0.01). CD8+ T-cell CD69 expression decreased in the SUB+aCD40+clod group (SUB+aCD40:19%, SUB+aCD40+clod:6%, p< 0.01). CD8 T-cell infiltration (SUB+aCD40:4.95%, SUB+aCD40+clod:3.85%, p=0.27) and CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (veh: 1.26, SUB+aCD40:0.52, SUB+aCD40+clod:0.69, p=0.09) were not affected by clodronate. Conclusion: SUB+aCD40 therapy confers a survival advantage in the KPC46 model of PDAC in a T-cell independent manner by increasing macrophage/monocyte infiltration. SUB+aCD40 promotes CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation, but they do not contribute to survival advantage, possibly due to exhaustion. Future work will include addition of therapeutics to mitigate/reverse T-cell exhaustion to harness both innate and adaptive immunity in treating PDAC.

        <tr id="The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in modulating the proliferation, activation, and normal functioning of immune cells through the regulation of protein degradation and function. By influencing the expression of immune checkpoint-associated proteins, the UPS modulates T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and can potentially facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. Additionally, the UPS contributes to the remodeling of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) by regulating B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and Treg cells. Targeting the UPS in conjunction with immune checkpoint-associated proteins, and combining these with other therapeutic approaches, may significantly enhance the efficacy of combination therapies and pave the way for novel cancer treatment strategies. In this review, we first summarize the composition and alterations of the TIME, with a particular emphasis on the role of the UPS in TIME and its interactions with various immune cell types. Finally, we explore the potential of combining UPS-targeted therapies with immunotherapy to substantially improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy and enhance patient survival outcomes.">

        <tr id="T cell surveillance of tissues is spatially organized: circulating memory T cells perform surveillance of secondary lymphoid organs while tissue-resident memory T cells act as sentinels in barrier tissues. In the context of infection, tissue-resident memory T cells survive long term in barrier tissues and are poised to respond to re-encounter of infectious agents. The activity of such tissue-resident T cells is regulated by the PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitory receptors targeted by cancer immunotherapies. This review investigates the hypothesis that T cells with a tissue residency program play an important role in both protective anti-tumor immunity and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). A series of translational studies have demonstrated that a higher density of tissue-resident T cells within tumors is associated with favorable survival outcomes in a diverse range of cancer types. Tissue-resident T cells have also been implicated in clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade, and dynamic tracking of T cell populations in pre- and on-treatment tumor samples demonstrated that T cells with a tissue residency program responded early to ICB. Investigation of colitis and dermatitis as examples of irAEs demonstrated that tissue-resident memory T cells were reactivated at these epithelial sites, resulting in a highly cytotoxic state and secretion of inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. It will therefore be important to consider how a tissue residency program can be enhanced to promote T cell-mediated tumor immunity while preventing the development of irAEs.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Lung cancer remains a major global health threat due to its complex microenvironment, particularly the role of neutrophils, which are crucial for tumor development and immune evasion mechanisms. This study aimed to delve into the impact of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil functions and their potential implications for lung cancer progression.


METHODS
Employing in vitro experimental models, this study has analyzed the effects of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil IL-8 and IFN-γ secretion, apoptosis, PD-L1 expression, and T-cell proliferation by using techniques, such as ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and CFSE proliferation assay. The roles of IL-8/PD-L1 in regulating neutrophil functions were further explored using inhibitors for IL-8 and PD-L1.


RESULTS
Lung cancer cell lines were found to secrete higher levels of IL-8 compared to normal lung epithelial cells. The conditioned media from lung cancer cells significantly reduced apoptosis in neutrophils, increased PD-L1 expression, and suppressed T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion. These effects were partially reversed in the presence of IL-8 inhibitors in Tumor Tissue Culture Supernatants (TTCS), while being further enhanced by IL-8. Both apoptosis and PD-L1 expression in neutrophils demonstrated dose-dependency to TTCS. Additionally, CFSE proliferation assay results further confirmed the inhibitory effect of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on T-cell proliferation.


CONCLUSION
This study has revealed lung cancer cell-conditioned media to modulate neutrophil functions through regulating factors, such as IL-8, thereby affecting immune regulation and tumor progression in the lung cancer microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma (GSRCC) is a subtype of gastric cancer with distinct phenotype and high risk of peritoneal metastasis. Studies have shown that early GSRCC has a good prognosis, while advanced GSRCC is insensitive to radiotherapy, chemotherapy or immune checkpoint blockade therapy. With technological advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and cytometry by time of flight mass cytometry, more detailed atlas of tumor microenvironment (TME) in GSRCC and its association with prognosis could be investigated extensively. Recently, two single-cell RNA sequencing studies revealed that GSRCC harbored a unique TME, manifested as highly immunosuppressive, leading to high immune escape. The TME of advanced GSRCC was enriched for immunosuppressive factors, including the loss of CXCL13+-cluster of differentiation 8+-Tex cells and declined clonal crosstalk among populations of T and B cells. In addition, GSRCC was mainly infiltrated by follicular B cells. The increased proportion of SRCC was accompanied by a decrease in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-derived B cells and a significant increase in follicular B cells, which may be one of the reasons for the poor prognosis of GSRCC. By understanding the relationship between immunosuppressive TME and poor prognosis in GSRCC and the underlying mechanism, more effective immunotherapy strategies and improved treatment outcomes of GSRCC can be anticipated.">

        <tr id="Hypoxia occurs in settings where stringent control of inflammation is mandatory to avoid tissue damage. Here, we analyzed how hypoxia-induced mediators alter recognition of pathogen-derived molecular patterns (PAMPs). The most relevant finding was that hypoxia selectively targets IFN-α induced upon stimulation with nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLR7/8 and -9) in PBMC. Notably, IFN-α secretion was reduced, but IFN-α producing capacity preserved. Corroborating these findings IFN-dependent cytokines IP-10 and IL-12 p70 were reduced under hypoxia, while other cytokines such as TNF remained unaffected. A role for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) was confirmed with prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors CoCl2 and DMOG. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) were identified as the major source of IFN-α and experiments in B cell/PDC and monocyte/PDC cocultures indicated that T cells are not required and both lymphoid and myeloid cells equally support inhibition of IFN-α. Moreover, supernatants from unstimulated PBMC generated under hypoxic conditions were not suppressive but further experiments indicated that hypoxia-specific release of IFN-α regulators lactate and TGF-β can contribute to the IFN-α blockage and might synergize with PGE2. However, each one of these factors alone is insufficient to block IFN-α secretion. These findings suggest that control of the PDC response occurs via combined soluble factors and cell contact-dependent mechanisms, thereby enabling a fine-tuning of the anti-microbial immune response in hypoxia.">

While multiple infiltrated immune cells have been reported to mediate disease progress, knowledge of HPV-reactive T-cell subsets in papillomas remains elusive. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and RNA microarray, we found that CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells with strong interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production expanded, and were negatively correlated to the disease severity in the frequency of surgery. These IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells were readily activated and expanded in vitro by autologous dendritic cells loaded with HPV11 E7 peptide pool. Moreover, T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion was observed in JORRP papilloma tissues, indicating a biased TCR repertoire toward HPV-specific recognition. Finally, we identified and characterized HPV11 E7-specific candidate TCR clonotypes from IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells, suggesting their potential application in TCR-engineered T cells (TCR-T) therapy for HPV11-related diseases. Our findings provided insights into the specific local immune response to HPV6/11 infection and highlighted the importance of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TRM cells in anti-HPV6/11 T-cell immunity.IMPORTANCEThe persistent recurrence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11 infection in papillomas underscores the failure of local immune responses in patients with juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP).

In the present study, we characterized CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells as the primary T-cell subset responsible for local anti-HPV6/11 immunity. Moreover, we identified two HPV11 E7-specific candidate T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes out of IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells. Overall, our findings provided insights into the local immune responses to HPV6/11 infection and offered information for developing more effective immunotherapeutic strategies against JORRP.">

The activation of DCs is a crucial step in inducing anti-tumor immunity. Upon recognition and uptake of tumor antigens, activated DCs present these antigens to naive T cells, thereby stimulating T cell-mediated immune responses and enhancing their ability to attack tumors. It is particularly noted that DCs are able to cross-present foreign antigens to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, prompting CD8+ T cells to proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic T cells. In the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the inactivation of DCs plays an important role, and the activation of DCs is particularly important in anti-HCC immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a group of rare lymphoproliferative malignancies manifesting in the skin. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas are an incurable, disfiguring, and life-threatening disease. Emerging studies have implicated the surrounding cells of malignant T cells (tumor microenvironment) in the disease evolution. This has revealed that targeting the tumor microenvironment has therapeutic potential in cutaneous T cell lymphomas. This review provides a detailed insight into the contribution of the tumor microenvironment in cutaneous T cell lymphomas and the targeting strategies. Abstract Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome being the two common subtypes. Despite the substantial improvement in early-stage diagnosis and treatments, some patients still progress to the advanced stage with an elusive underpinning mechanism. While this unsubstantiated disease mechanism coupled with diverse clinical outcomes poses challenges in disease management, emerging evidence has implicated the tumor microenvironment in the disease process, thus revealing a promising therapeutic potential of targeting the tumor microenvironment. Notably, malignant T cells can shape their microenvironment to dampen antitumor immunity, leading to Th2-dominated responses that promote tumor progression. This is largely orchestrated by alterations in cytokines expression patterns, genetic dysregulations, inhibitory effects of immune checkpoint molecules, and immunosuppressive cells. Herein, the recent insights into the determining factors in the CTCL tumor microenvironment that support their progression have been highlighted. Also, recent advances in strategies to target the CTCL tumor micromovement with the rationale of improving treatment efficacy have been discussed.">

Thus, reinforcing the anti-cancer immune response is needed to improve the effectiveness of T-cell-mediated therapy. Tumor-associated protease ADAM10, endothelial cells (ECs) and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells engage in complex communication via adhesion, transmigration and chemotactic mechanisms to facilitate an anti-cancer immune response. The precise impact of ADAM10 on the intricate mechanisms underlying these interactions remains unclear. This paper broadly explores how ADAM10, through different routes, influences the efficacy of T-cell-mediated therapy. ADAM10 cleaves CD8+ T-cell-targeting genes and impacts their expression and specificity. In addition, ADAM10 mediates the interactions of adhesion molecules with T cells and influences CD8+ T-cell activity and trafficking. Thus, understanding the role of ADAM10 in these events may lead to innovative strategies for advancing T-cell-mediated therapies.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is characterized by its high transmissibility, which has caused a worldwide epidemiological event. Yet, it turns ominous once the disease progression degenerates into severe pneumonia and sepsis, presenting a horrendous lethality. To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="Abstract The ability of the skin to “remember” has been a potential mechanism for studying recurrent skin diseases. While it has been thought that the ability to retain past encounters is the prerogative of immune cells, it has recently been discovered that skin tissue stem cells can also take on this task. Epithelial stem cells undergoing inflammation retain their “memory” through epigenetic reprogramming and exhibit rapid epithelialization and epidermal proliferation upon secondary stimulation. This is a non-specific memory modality independent of conventional immune memory, in which histone modifications (acetylation and methylation) and specific transcription factors (AP-1 and STAT3) are involved in the establishment of inflammatory memories, and AIM2/Caspase-1/IL-1β mainly performs the rapid effects of memory. This finding is intriguing for addressing recurrent inflammatory skin diseases, which may explain the fixed-site recurrence of inflammatory skin diseases and develop new therapeutic strategies in the future. However, more research is still needed to decipher the mysteries of memory.">

        <tr id="Chronic activation of the adaptive immune system is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. As PI3Kδ is a key regulator of T and B-cell differentiation and function, we hypothesized that alleviation of adaptive immunity by PI3Kδ inactivation may represent an attractive strategy counteracting atherogenesis. As expected, lack of hematopoietic PI3Kδ in atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr-/- mice resulted in hindered T- and B-cell numbers, CD4+ effector T cells, Th1 response, and immunoglobulin levels. However, despite markedly impaired peripheral proinflammatory Th1 cells and atheromatous CD4+ T cells, the unexpected net effect of hematopoietic PI3Kδ deficiency was aggravated vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. Further analyses revealed that PI3Kδ deficiency impaired numbers, immunosuppressive functions, and stability of regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs), whereas macrophage biology remained largely unaffected. Adoptive transfer of wild-type Tregs fully restrained the atherosclerotic plaque burden in Ldlr-/- mice lacking hematopoietic PI3Kδ, whereas PI3Kδ deficient Tregs failed to mitigate disease. Numbers of atheroprotective B-1 and proatherogenic B-2 cells as well serum immunoglobulin levels remained unaffected by adoptively transferred wild-type Tregs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hematopoietic PI3Kδ ablation promotes atherosclerosis. Mechanistically, we identified PI3Kδ signaling as a powerful driver of atheroprotective Treg responses, which outweigh PI3Kδ driven proatherogenic effects of adaptive immune cells like Th1 cells.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a major health risk during pregnancy. Whilst vaccination and antiviral agents are widely employed and reduce IAV-induced symptoms, they are not sufficient to control IAV infections in pregnancy, especially during pandemics. Respiratory viruses like IAV, exploit immune alterations that occur during pregnancy, including the upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) like PDL1, PD1 and CTLA4. We hypothesize that blocking expression of PDL1 on innate immune cells will improve maternal immunity following IAV infection. We utilized murine models of IAV infection during pregnancy with and without treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), a-PDL1. Pregnant and non-pregnant mice were infected with mouse adapted IAV (A/PR/8) and assessed at 3 days post infection (3dpi). Lung cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. Lung mRNA expression of inflammatory and antiviral markers and histology was measured. Protein concentrations of inflammatory and antiviral markers, as well as viral titers was measured from lung bronchiolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lung function was also assessed. Following IAV infection, immune cells from pregnant mice had significant increases in the ICPs, PDL1, PD1 and CTLA4. a-PDL1 treatment effectively suppressed these ICPs and increased the activation marker, CD86. A-PDL1 treatment also reduced lung inflammatory cell infiltration and viral titres, increased antiviral responses, and improved lung function. Overall, IAV infection in pregnancy activates key inhibitory ICPs, leading to worsened disease outcomes. a-PDL1 treatment during IAV infection in pregnancy is an effective method to reduce ICP expression and improve overall immune cell responses.">

        <tr id="The use of antitumor drugs represents a reliable strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become increasingly common and contributes to tumor metastasis and local recurrence. The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) consists of immune cells, cytokines and immunomodulators, and collectively they influence the response to treatment. Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as increased drug exportation have been reported to contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancers. In the past few years, the majority of studies on tumors have only focused on the development and progression of a tumor from a mechanistic standpoint; few studies have examined whether the changes in the TME can also affect tumor growth and drug resistance. Recently, emerging evidence have raised more concerns regarding the role of TME in the development of drug resistance. In the present review, it was discussed how the suppressive TME adapts to drug resistance characterized by the cooperation of immune cells, cytokines, immunomodulators, stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was reviewed how these immunological or metabolic changes alter immuno-surveillance and thus facilitate tumor drug resistance. In addition, potential targets present in the TME for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve individualized therapy for cancer treatment were revealed.">

        <tr id="Since their conception with the smallpox vaccine, vaccines used worldwide have mitigated multiple pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Insightful studies have uncovered the complexities of different functional networks of CD4 T cells (T helper 1 (Th1); Th2, Th17) and CD8 T cells (T cytotoxic; Tc), as well as B cell (BIgM, BIgG, BIgA and BIgE) subsets, during the response to vaccination. Both T and B cell subsets form central, peripheral, and tissue-resident subsets during vaccination. It has also become apparent that each vaccination forms a network of T regulatory subsets, namely CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells and interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD4+ Foxp3− T regulatory 1 (Tr1), as well as many others, which shape the quality/quantity of vaccine-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody production. These components are especially critical for immunocompromised patients, such as older individuals and allograft recipients, as their vaccination may be ineffective or less effective. This review focuses on considering how the pre- and post-vaccination Treg/Tr1 levels influence the vaccination efficacy. Experimental and clinical work has revealed that Treg/Tr1 involvement evokes different immune mechanisms in diminishing vaccine-induced cellular/humoral responses. Alternative steps may be considered to improve the vaccination response, such as increasing the dose, changing the delivery route, and/or repeated booster doses of vaccines. Vaccination may be combined with anti-CD25 (IL-2Rα chain) or anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to decrease the Tregs and boost the T/B cell immune response. All of these data and strategies for immunizations are presented and discussed, aiming to improve the efficacy of vaccination in humans and especially in immunocompromised and older individuals, as well as organ transplant patients.">

        <tr id="A key mediator of T cell impairment during respiratory virus infection is the inhibitory receptor PD-1. PD-1 is induced on T cells following antigen exposure, whereas proinflammatory cytokines upregulate the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Respiratory virus infection leads to upregulation of PD-L1 on airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and alveolar macrophages. However, the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in acute respiratory virus infections is not known. We sought to determine the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in CD8+ T cell impairment. We found that PD-L1-/- mice challenged with human metapneumovirus or influenza showed a similar level of CD8+ T cell impairment compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, virus clearance was delayed in PD-L1-/- mice compared to WT. CD8+ T cells from PD-L1-deficient mice expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors both at baseline and after respiratory virus infection. The antibody blockade of PD-L2 failed to restore function to the impaired cells. While reciprocal bone marrow chimeras between WT and PD-L1-/- mice did not restore CD8+ T cell function after the respiratory virus challenge, mice that received the PD-L1-/- bone marrow had higher inhibitory receptor expression on CD8+ cells. This discrepancy in the inhibitory receptor expression suggests that cells of the hematopoietic compartment contribute to T cell impairment on CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEThe phenomenon of pulmonary CD8+ T cell impairment with diminished antiviral function occurs during acute respiratory virus infection mediated by Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) signaling. Moreover, PD-1 blockade enhances T cell function to hasten viral clearance. The ligand PD-L1 is expressed in many cell types, but which cells drive lung T cell impairment is not known. We used genetic approaches to determine the contribution of PD-L1 on lung T cell impairment. We found that PD-L2 cannot compensate for the loss of PD-L1, and PD-L1-deficient mice exhibit increased expression of other inhibitory receptors. Bone marrow chimeras between PD-L1-deficient and wild-type mice indicated that hematopoietic PD-L1 expression is associated with inhibitory receptor upregulation and impairment.">

The infection manifests itself as genital herpes but in rare cases it can cause meningitis. In this study, we used a murine model of HSV-2 meningitis to show that Fas and FasL are induced within the CNS upon HSV-2 infection, both on resident microglia and astrocytes and on infiltrating monocytes and lymphocytes. Mice lacking Fas or FasL had a more severe disease development with significantly higher morbidity, mortality, and an overall higher CNS viral load. In parallel, these Fas/FasL-deficient mice showed a severely impaired infection-induced CNS inflammatory response with lower levels of infiltrating CD4+ T-cells, lower levels of Th1 cytokines and chemokines, and a shift in the balance between M1 and M2 microglia/monocytes. In vitro, we confirmed that Fas and FasL is required for the induction of leucocyte apoptosis, but also show that the Fas/FasL pathway is required for adequate cytokine and chemokine production by glial cells. In summary, our data show that the Fas/FasL cell death receptor pathway is an important defense mechanism in the spinal cord as it down-regulates HSV-2-induced inflammation while at the same time promoting adequate anti-viral immune responses against infection.">

Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, controlled glucocorticoid signaling within the effector CD8+ T cells is crucial for optimal memory differentiation.">

 Immunotherapy has had very limited success in pancreatic cancer, due to its low mutational burden and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our approach consists in redirecting pre- existing antiviral immunity against pancreatic tumors by delivering viral antigens using the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD .This peptide, targets the tumor vasculature through av integrins and neuropilin-1, delivering conjugated or co-administered cargo to tumors. Here we used mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) as an infection model. CMV is a β-herpesvirus that induces a strong T-cell response in mice and humans, comprising >10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells mostly with effector-memory phenotype. Importantly, human CMV infects over 60% of the world’s population rendering it a suitable candidate for translation. Methods: Mice latently infected with CMV were orthotopically implanted with KPC pancreatic tumor cells and treated with systemic injections of vehicle or iRGD plus CMV class I and II binding peptides. Another cohort of age matched uninfected mice was used as a control. Tumor growth and mouse weight were monitored twice a week and CMV specific immune responses were measured in spleen, liver and tumor by flow cytometry, using tetramer staining and CMV specific peptide recall. Results: CMV infected mice receiving iRGD+CMV peptides responded to treatment as evidenced by delayed tumor growth associated with increased tumor necrosis and T cell infiltration. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of tumor, liver and spleen showed a significant increase in CMV specific T cells preferentially in the tumor. Surprisingly, these T cells preferentially infiltrated tumors regardless of the use of iRGD for tumor targeting of CMV peptides. Survival studies showed a marked increase in median survival, reaching 42 days in the infected and treated group, compared to 25 days in the vehicle treated one. The survival benefit was very similar in the presence or absence of iRGD. Combining this strategy with anti- PD1 and or anti-IL10R did not significantly improve the benefits of CMV therapy alone. On the other hand, combination with low dose gemcitabine (5mg/kg) significantly improved tumor growth delay and survival in the combination compared to either therapy alone. The median survival reached 49 days in the combination, compared to 39 for gemcitabine or CMV therapy alone and 32 for vehicle.Conclusions: We have recently performed single cell RNA sequencing in tumors from infected and CMV peptide or vehicle treated mice and will analyze the transcriptional profile and TCR sequence of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary analysis of this data shows a massive T cell infiltration and an increase in dendritic cells and macrophages in infected and treated mice. Taken together, this data shows we can deliver antigens to pancreatic tumors and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that results in delayed tumor growth and has a survival benefit. This is a mutation agnostic approach with high translational value, since more than 60% of the population has previous CMV immunity.

Glioma, characterized by limited lymphocytic infiltration, constitutes an "immune-desert" tumor displaying insensitivity to various immunotherapies. This study aims to explore therapeutic strategies for inducing tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation within the glioma microenvironment (GME) to transition it from an immune-resistant to an activated state.

TLS formation in GME was successfully induced by intracranial administration of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (OK-432, TLR2/4/9 agonist) and glioma antigens (i.c. αTLR-mix). We employed staining analysis, antibody neutralization, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), and BCR/TCR sequencing to investigate the underlying mechanisms of TLS formation and its role in anti-glioma immunity. Additionally, a preliminary translational clinical study was conducted.


RESULTS
TLS formation correlated with increased lymphocyte infiltration in GME and led to improved prognosis in glioma-bearing mice. In the study of TLS induction mechanisms, certain macrophages/microglia and Th17 displayed markers of "LTo" and "LTi" cells, respectively, interaction through LTα/β-LTβR promoted TLS induction. Post-TLS formation, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but not CD19+ B cells contributed to anti-glioma immunity. Comparative analysis of B/T cells between brain and lymph node showed that brain B/T cells unveiled switch from naïve to mature, some B cells highlighted an enrichment of CSR-associated genes, V gene usage and clonotype bias were observed. In related clinical studies, i.c. αTLR-mix treatment exhibited tolerability, and chemokines/cytokines assay provided preliminary evidence supporting TLS formation in GME.


CONCLUSION
TLS induction in GME enhanced anti-glioma immunity, improved the immune microenvironment, and controlled glioma growth, suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for treating glioma in the future.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells and bispecific antibodies (BsAb) targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) have significantly advanced the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Resistance to BCMA-targeting therapies, nonetheless, remains a significant challenge. BCMA shedding by gamma-secretase is a known resistance mechanism, and preclinical studies suggest that inhibition may improve anti-BCMA therapy. Leveraging a phase I clinical trial of the gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI), crenigacestat, with anti-BCMA CAR T-cells (FCARH143), we utilized single-nuclei RNA sequencing and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) sequencing to characterize the effects of GSI on the tumor microenvironment. The most significant impacts of GSI involved effects on monocytes, which are known to promote tumor growth. In addition to observing a reduction in the frequency of non-classical monocytes, we also detected significant changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and inferred cell-cell interactions following exposure to GSI. Although many genes with altered expression are associated with gamma-secretase-dependent signaling, such as Notch, other pathways were affected, indicating GSI has far-reaching effects. Finally, we detected monoallelic deletion of the BCMA locus in some patients with prior exposure to anti-BCMA therapy, which significantly correlated with reduced progression-free survival (median PFS 57 days versus 861 days). GSIs are being explored in combination with the full spectrum of BCMA targeting agents, and our results reveal widespread effects of GSI on both tumor and immune cell populations, providing insight into mechanisms for enhancing BCMA-directed therapies.">

        <tr id="Background
CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in immune responses, and have significant potential in tumor immunotherapy. The JAK/STAT pathway is essential for cytokine signal transduction and is linked to immune escape. However, its role in mediating CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immunity in renal cancer is not fully understood.


Objective
To study the mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and propose new possibilities for immunotherapy in patients with renal cancer.


Methods
CD8+ T cells from mouse spleens were sorted using immunomagnetic beads, and their purity was confirmed by flow cytometry. Proliferation was analyzed using CCK-8 and CFSE assays. Activation of CD8+ T cells was assessed through ELISA and Western blotting. The malignant properties of Renca cells were evaluated through flow cytometry, Calcein-AM/PI staining, wound healing, Transwell, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. A subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice was used to examine the role of JAK1/STAT1 pathway in vivo.


Results
Inhibitors of JAK1 and STAT1 significantly reduced the proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cell. Co-culture with CD8+ T cells increased apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Renca cells. The effects were diminished by JAK1 and STAT1 inhibitors, confirming that CD8+ T cells exert antitumor effects through the JAK1/STAT1 pathway. In vivo, inhibition of this pathway reduced the anti-tumor effects of CD8+ T cells.


Conclusion
Inhibitors of JAK1 and STAT1 weakened the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cells, suggesting that targeting this pathway could enhance CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity in renal cancer.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a survival rate under 12%. Treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy are ineffective in PDAC due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, in which tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are a major component. TAN immunosuppression has been shown to depend upon increased production of reactive oxygen species, with myeloperoxidase (MPO) being a major source of it. We investigated the contribution of MPO in mediating TAN immunosuppression using orthotopic PDAC models in wild-type and syngeneic MPO-deficient mice. We observed a significant delay in tumor growth and improved clinical scores when MPO was deficient. Additionally, treatment with the MPO-specific inhibitor Verdiperstat also delayed tumor growth. Flow cytometry analysis of the tumor microenvironment further confirmed a significant increase in CD8 T and NK cells, along with an increase in granzyme B level in both subsets, when MPO was deficient. Additionally, there was an increase in activation marker (CD25) and memory subset among both CD8 and CD4 T cells in MPO-deficient mice. Ex vivo studies with isolated TANs from tumor-bearing mice showed reduced CD8 T and NK cell suppression, and reactive oxygen species level in absence of MPO, supporting the contribution of MPO in TAN immunosuppression. These data suggest that loss of MPO in TANs has decreased immunosuppressive functions resulting in increased cytotoxic and activated T cells and NK cells with increased memory response within the tumor microenvironment. Our results demonstrate the contribution of MPO in regulating tumor progression, TAN immunosuppression, and immune cell infiltration using an orthotopic PDAC model.

Here, we developed a clinically scalable protocol for expanding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific TSCM-enriched T cells with high proportions of CD4+ T cells and broad EBV antigen coverage. These cells showed tumor control in a xenograft model of EBV-induced lymphoma and were superior to previous ACT protocols in terms of tumor infiltration, in vivo proliferation, persistence, proportion of functional CD4+ T cells, and diversity of EBV antigen specificity.

However, their effector function can be severely impaired by inhibitory receptors such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3). Here Siglec-G is identified as a coinhibitory receptor that limits CD8+ T cell function. Siglec-G is highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating T cells and is enriched in the exhausted T cell subset. Ablation of Siglec-G enhances the efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in suppressing solid tumors growth. Mechanistically, sialoglycan ligands, such as CD24 on tumor cells, activate the Siglec-G-SHP2 axis in CD8+ T cells, impairing metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which dampens cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity. These findings discover a critical role for Siglec-G in inhibiting CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting its potential therapeutic effect in adoptive T cell therapy and tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Many chronic inflammatory diseases are attributed to disturbances in host-microbe interactions, which drive immune-mediated tissue damage. Depending on the anatomic setting, a chronic inflammatory disease can exert unique local and systemic influences, which provide an exceptional opportunity for understanding disease mechanism and testing therapeutic interventions. The oral cavity is an easily accessible environment that allows for protective interventions aiming at modulating the immune response to control disease processes driven by a breakdown of host-microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger nonresolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss, and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional, or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment up-regulated M2-macrophage and downregulated proinflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2-treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host-microbe homeostasis.">

 Despite significant treatment advances, the poor long-term prognosis for children with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) persists. The application of immune cell-based therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells and bispecific T-cell engagers, has improved progression-free survival for many B-ALL patients. However, many of these patients still experience disease relapse. While tumours are widely recognized to influence T cell function, this relationship has not been extensively studied in B-ALL. A clinically silent pre-leukemic phase usually precedes childhood B-ALL. Since only a small percentage of children subsequently develop disease, the impact of pre-leukemia on T cell function remains elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the development of T cell dysfunction in B-ALL and explored ways to restore it using in situ and transplanted leukemia models Using the Emu-Ret transgenic mouse model of hyperdiploid B-ALL, we investigated the induction of exhaustion-associated marker expression (PD-1, CTLA-4 and Tim-3) on T cells. Longitudinal analysis of marker expression revealed that an upregulation of multiple immune checkpoints such as PD-1 and Tim-3, on T cells occurred only in the presence of leukemia cells, not during the extended preleukemia phase. This suggests that T cell exhaustion occurs exclusively during the established malignancy phase, highlighting the evolving nature of T cell responses as disease progresses. Next, we measured exhaustion-associated marker expression in a syngeneic model of transplanted B-ALL. While expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 on T cells correlated with disease progression, a significant increase in these markers was already detectable at low leukemia burden. This indicates that T cell exhaustion is not merely a reflection of high disease burden and highlights the differing impact exerted by preleukemic and leukemic cells on T cells. Phenotypically exhausted T cells from both mouse models showed reduced proliferation, activation, and cytokine secretion. Previously, we have demonstrated the ability of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to induce immune control over B-ALL cells. Thus, we investigated the impact of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), a ligand for TLR-9, to overcome T cell dysfunction. The treatment of leukemia bearing mice with CpG ODN led to a decrease in PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells, which was also associated with a reduction in leukemia burden. Lastly, the administration of a checkpoint blockade antibodies, with or without TLR agonists as adjuvant therapy led to increased survival of leukemia bearing mice. Overall, this study demonstrates the functional impact of interactions between B-ALL cells and the immune system. The findings from this study may inform therapeutic approaches to overcome B-ALL immune evasion mechanisms and enhance patient outcomes.

 Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, only 20-40% of all patients respond to immunotherapy. Further, efficacy varies highly by tumor type. Tumors with high infiltration of canonically anti-tumoral immune cells, such as lung cancers, also tend to display increased sensitivity to treatment. In contrast, those with higher infiltration of pro-tumoral immune cells, such as pancreatic cancers, are much less amenable to immunotherapy. These differences in immune infiltration have been linked to differential transcriptional regulation of immune cell recruiting factors, suggesting that perhaps tumors can intrinsically assemble different immune microenvironments in a tissue-of-origin dependent manner. Thus, it is necessary to better understand the factors that lead to heterogeneity of immune cell infiltration, how these mechanisms differ across tumor types, and how they may be perturbed to improve therapy responses. Here, we utilized two panels of clonal cell lines both driven by Kras-G12D and Tp53-R172H mutations but derived from two different tissues of origin: the lung and pancreas. These panels serve to recapitulate the immune heterogeneity of non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively, while controlling for genetic drivers that may influence immune infiltration. Analyses of subcutaneously implanted lung and pancreatic-origin tumors revealed that the overall abundance of immunosuppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) is significantly higher in pancreatic-origin tumors while the infiltration of dendritic cells is much lower as compared to that of lung-origin tumors, despite controlling for engraftment site. Likewise, lung, but not pancreatic-origin tumors exhibit more rapid tumor growth upon natural killer (NK) cell depletion, suggesting a lung-origin specific role of NK cells in controlling tumor burden. There were also similarities in immune archetype, with T-cell abundance negatively correlating with that of gMDSCs. However, whereas “T-cell inflamed” pancreatic tumors partially respond to immune checkpoint blockade, their lung-origin counterparts do not. We hypothesized that these differences in immune phenotype and subsequent therapy response may be due in part to somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). We performed sparse whole genome sequencing and identified substantial genomic rearrangements in both lung and pancreatic-origin tumors. Notably, the specific regions of rearrangements differed highly between the two panels, with lung-origin clones showing more amplifications in chromosomes 2 and 11 and deletions in chromosomes 16 and 18. These results suggest that there are indeed tissue-of-origin specific differences in immune phenotype that can influence therapy outcome. Ongoing work seeks to further elucidate specific tumor cell-intrinsic factors that can be leveraged to skew the tumor immune microenvironment towards a more anti-tumoral phenotype and ultimately increase sensitivity to immunotherapy in a site-specific manner.

IFNγ treatment of organoids led to transcriptional reprogramming, marked by a switch to a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, including transcriptional upregulation of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Proteomic analysis of organoid-conditioned medium post-treatment confirmed chemokine secretion.

Strategies to improve immune-mediated control of FL could significantly benefit this population, particularly as it includes many elderly and comorbid patients. Immune cell engagers, especially bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), are crucial in targeting FL by bridging tumor and effector cells, thereby triggering T-cell activation and cytotoxic killing. CD3 × CD20 BsAbs have shown the most promise in clinical development for B-NHL patients, with structural variations affecting their target affinity and potency.

Indeed, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (e.g., T lymphocytes and natural killers) activity is greatly affected by signals (mostly ligands/receptors and paracrine) they receive in the TME, which frequently generate an immunosuppressive milieu. In the last years, it has become evident that soluble and receptor signaling is not the only way of communication between cells in the TME, with extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, playing a central role. Among the different new kind of vesicles recently discovered, migrasomes look like to be of extreme interest as they are not only different from the others, but also have been reported as able to deliver a very heterogeneous kind of messages, able to profoundly affect recipient cells’ behavior. Indeed, the role played by the different classes of extracellular vesicles, especially in the TME, relies on their not-directional diffusion from the originating cells, while migrasomes released from migrating cells do have a directional effect. Migrasomes biology and their involvement in cancer progression, dissemination, and resistance to therapy is still a largely obscure field, but with promising development foreseen in the next future.">

        <tr id="PIM1, the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus, is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. It is involved in many biological events, such as cell survival, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and cell migration, and has been widely studied in malignant diseases. However, recent studies have shown that PIM1 plays a prominent role in immunoinflammatory diseases, including autoimmune uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. PIM1 can function in inflammatory signal transduction by phosphorylating multiple inflammatory protein substrates and mediating macrophage activation and T lymphocyte cell specification, thus participating in the development of multiple immunoinflammatory diseases. Moreover, the inhibition of PIM1 has been demonstrated to ameliorate certain immunoinflammatory disorders. Based on these studies, we suggest PIM1 as a potential therapeutic target for immunoinflammatory diseases and a valid candidate for future research. Herein, for the first time, we provide a detailed review that focuses on the roles of PIM1 in the pathogenesis of immunoinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. Although serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) family members play crucial roles in tumors, their impact on tumor immunology remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of SRSF10 in HCC immunotherapy.


METHODS
To identify the key genes associated with immunotherapy resistance, we conducted single-nuclear RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, and The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses. We investigated the biological functions of SRSF10 in immune evasion using in vitro co-culture systems, flow cytometry, various tumor-bearing mouse models, and patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids.


RESULTS
SRSF10 was upregulated in various tumors and associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, SRSF10 positively regulated lactate production, and SRSF10/glycolysis/ histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) formed a positive feedback loop in tumor cells. Increased lactate levels promoted M2 macrophage polarization, thereby inhibiting CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, SRSF10 interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of MYB, enhancing MYB RNA stability, and subsequently upregulating key glycolysis-related enzymes including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), resulting in elevated intracellular and extracellular lactate levels. Lactate accumulation induced histone lactylation, which further upregulated SRSF10 expression. Additionally, lactate produced by tumors induced lactylation of the histone H3K18la site upon transport into macrophages, thereby activating transcription and enhancing pro-tumor macrophage activity. M2 macrophages, in turn, inhibited the enrichment of CD8+ T cells and the proportion of interferon-γ+CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus creating an immunosuppressive TME. Clinically, SRSF10 could serve as a biomarker for assessing immunotherapy resistance in various solid tumors. Pharmacological targeting of SRSF10 with a selective inhibitor 1C8 enhanced the efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in both murine and human preclinical models.


CONCLUSIONS
The SRSF10/MYB/glycolysis/lactate axis is critical for triggering immune evasion and anti-PD-1 resistance. Inhibiting SRSF10 by 1C8 may overcome anti-PD-1 tolerance in HCC.">

        <tr id="Engineered cellular therapy with CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) has revolutionized outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma (LBCL), but the cellular and molecular features associated with response remain largely unresolved. We analyzed serial peripheral blood samples ranging from day of apheresis (day -28/baseline) to 28 days after CAR-T infusion from 50 patients with LBCL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) by integrating single cell RNA and TCR sequencing (scRNA-seq/scTCR-seq), flow cytometry, and mass cytometry (CyTOF) to characterize features associated with response to CAR-T. Pretreatment patient characteristics associated with response included presence of B cells and increased lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (ALC/AMC). Infusion products from responders were enriched for clonally expanded, highly activated CD8+ T cells. We expanded these observations to 99 patients from the ZUMA-1 cohort and identified a subset of patients with elevated baseline B cells, 80% of whom were complete responders. We integrated B cell proportion 0.5% and ALC/AMC 1.2 into a two-factor predictive model and applied this model to the ZUMA-1 cohort. Estimated progression free survival (PFS) at 1 year in patients meeting one or both criteria was 65% versus 31% for patients meeting neither criterion. Our results suggest that patients' immunologic state at baseline affects likelihood of response to CAR-T through both modulation of the T cell apheresis product composition and promoting a more favorable circulating immune compartment prior to therapy. These baseline immunologic features, measured readily in the clinical setting prior to CAR-T, can be applied to predict response to therapy.">

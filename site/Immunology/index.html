        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) frequently follows allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and impacts the mucosa. This atlas study highlights the role of exhausted-like effector CD8+ T cells (TEXEF) in oral mucosal cGVHD pathogenesis. Biopsies from the oral mucosa were collected at oral cGVHD onset or at six months post-transplant and analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing and other modalities. At cGVHD onset, in addition to changes in the myeloid compartment, two distinct populations of CD8+T cells with a TEXEF phenotype were prevalent: an inflammatory CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_4) expressing CCL4, CD69, and TNFSF9, and an exhausted CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_5) characterized by the expression of CXCL13, HIF1A, and HLA-DRA, both correlated with clinical disease severity. Pseudo-time analysis suggests a transition from the inflammatory pre-exhausted CD8T_4 cluster to the cytolytic, terminally exhausted CD8T_5 cluster. The CXCL9-CXCR3 interactions among CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts and myeloid cells are implicated in tissue damage. Onset of cGVHD despite frequent oral mucosal FOXP3+ regulatory CD4+T cells suggests potential impaired Treg function or CD8+T cell dysfunction. These findings highlight TEXEF cells as key contributors to oral cGVHD pathology and potential therapeutic targets for mitigating sustained tissue injury in cGVHD.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) orchestrates a profound disruption of immune balance within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. To better understand these complex immune dynamics, we used high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling to comprehensively characterize the immune landscape of the BM across different stages of myeloma progression, including MGUS (n = 16), smoldering MM (SMM; n = 25), and active MM, both newly diagnosed (n = 43) and relapsed/refractory (n = 104). Our analysis revealed substantial immune remodeling during disease progression, characterized by adaptive immune suppression and extensive infiltration of innate immune populations. Transformation from MGUS to SMM was marked by significant alterations in central and effector memory T helper cells, effector cytotoxic T cells, and an enrichment of monocytic and neutrophil subsets. Active MM stages were further distinguished by increased expansion of myeloid and monocytic lineages, alongside a pronounced reduction in progenitor and transitional B cells. Correspondence analysis demonstrated that specific immune profiles were significantly associated with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall survival. This study highlights the potential of CyTOF-based molecular profiling to unravel the intricate immune dynamics of the BM microenvironment across MM disease stages, enhancing our understanding of MM pathogenesis and providing a foundation for identifying prognostic biomarkers and tailoring precision immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells support tailored B cell responses against multiple classes of pathogens. To reveal how diverse TFH phenotypes are established, we profiled mouse TFH cells in response to viral, helminth and bacterial infection. We identified a core TFH signature that is distinct from CD4+ T follicular regulatory and effector cells and identified pathogen-specific transcriptional modules that shape TFH function. Cytokine-transcriptional TFH programming demonstrated that type I interferon and TGFβ signaling direct individual TFH phenotypes to instruct B cell output. Cytokine-directed TFH transcriptional phenotypes are shared within human germinal centers, but distinct TFH phenotypes dominate between donors and following immune challenge or in antibody-mediated disease. Finally, we identified new cell surface markers that align with distinct TFH phenotypes. Thus, we provide a comprehensive resource of TFH diversity in humans and mice to enable immune monitoring during infection and disease and to inform the development of context-specific vaccines.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils have emerged as key players in tumor progression and are often associated with poor prognosis. Despite ongoing efforts to target neutrophil functions in cancer, therapeutic success has been limited. In this study, we addressed the possibility of blocking STAT3 signaling in neutrophils as a targeted therapeutic intervention in cancer. Conditional deletion of Stat3 in a neutrophil-specific manner (Ly6GcreStat3fl/fl mice) significantly impaired tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Neutrophils isolated from these mice exhibited a strong antitumoral phenotype, with increased MHCII, CD80/86 and ICAM-1 expression. Immune profiling of tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of these mice revealed significant enrichment of CD8+ T cells (granzymeBhi, perforinhi and IFN-γhi) with strong cytotoxic activity. To further translate these findings to human settings, we blocked STAT3 signaling in cancer patient neutrophils via the small molecule inhibitor LLL12 and assessed its effects on patient-derived tumor explants. In agreement with the in vivo mouse data, we observed the expansion and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in such explants. To test the therapeutic applicability of STAT3 targeting, we utilized myeloid cell-selective STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide (CpG-STAT3ASO) to target neutrophils in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with previous results, neutrophil-specific STAT3 knockdown impaired tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxic T cell activity in the tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of treated mice. These findings highlight STAT3 signaling as a deleterious pathway supporting the protumoral activity of neutrophils and suggest that neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition is a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy, providing novel insights into targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) typically trigger rapid and robust innate immune responses in the bladder. In order to identify the key facets of the host response that influence pathogen clearance and tissue damage, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to investigate the transcriptomic changes of immune cells in mouse bladder after UPEC infection. Single-cell analysis revealed significant elevated CD137L expression in macrophages and dendritic cells in bladder after UPEC infection. CD137L defines a macrophage population in bladder that is important for the host response to UPEC infection. Deletion of CD137L in macrophages resulted in severe bacterial burden and bladder inflammation during the acute stage of UPEC infection. Further study demonstrated that the crucial role of CD137L+ macrophages in protecting against UPEC infection might be mediated by Tregs, which express high levels of CD137 (the receptor for CD137L). Deletion of CD137L+ macrophages decreased Treg cells and led to a reduction in inhibitory factors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 on Tregs. Deletion of Tregs using Foxp3DTR mice also aggravated inflammatory reactions, bacterial load, and urothelial destruction during the acute phase of UPEC infection. Similarly, the deletion of CD137 in Tregs resulted in a decrease in these inhibitory factors on Tregs, causing more severe bladder inflammation during UPEC infection. These results illuminate the immune landscape of the bladder infected by UPEC and highlight the crucial role of CD137L+ macrophages during UPEC infection in bladder. CD137L+ macrophages might prevent excessive inflammatory response during the host response to UPEC infection by regulating Tregs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with limited treatment options. Macrophage phagocytosis is a complex, tightly regulated process governed by competing pro-phagocytic and anti-phagocytic signals. CD47-SIRPα signaling inhibits macrophage activity, while radiotherapy (RT) can enhance tumor immunogenicity. How RT and CD47 blockade together modulate macrophage “appetite” and activation states remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of glioma immune evasion and therapy resistance. Methods Human and mouse glioma cell lines were exposed to fractionated RT, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, or both. Flow cytometry and ELISA quantified the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and expression of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In vitro, phagocytosis assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze transcriptional changes in macrophage subsets that phagocytosed (“eaters”) or did not phagocytose (“non-eaters”) glioma cells. In vivo, efficacy of combination therapy was assessed using orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of DMG and GBM. Results RT induced ICD in glioma cells, evidenced by dose-dependent increases in DAMPs such as phosphatidylserine, calreticulin, HSP70/90, and HMGB1. RT and anti-CD47 each promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, with a synergistic effect observed when combined. scRNA-seq of phagocytic macrophages revealed transcriptionally distinct subpopulations associated with each treatment, characterized by enrichment in inflammatory, metabolic, and antigen presentation pathways. In vivo, combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden, extended survival, and polarized tumor-associated macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. Distinct macrophage markers (CLEC7A, CD44, CD63) validated scRNA-seq findings in vivo. Conclusions This study highlights that macrophage fate is intimately linked to the molecular properties of what they phagocytose. Phagocytosis is not a singular, uniform process but a dynamic and context-dependent event that drives macrophage specialization and plasticity. By demonstrating that RT and anti-CD47 therapy shape distinct macrophage phenotypes through their effects on tumor immunogenicity, this study provides a framework for understanding how to harness and reprogram macrophage activity for therapeutic benefit. These findings underscore the potential of targeting macrophage plasticity as a strategy to enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes in malignant gliomas and other diseases.">

        <tr id="Comprehensive characterization of bovine immune cell populations is essential for improving animal welfare and disease resilience. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 29,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Angus cattle stratified by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a proxy for the cellular immune response (Cell-IR). Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity. Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat highlighted pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, particularly the IL-1β– IL-1R1 ligand-receptor interactions. This study provides a high-resolution atlas of Angus PBMCs and establishes a framework for linking immune cell composition with functional immune phenotypes in cattle.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in solid tumors, including Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), is associated with a better prognosis and a better response to immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). The detailed mechanisms by which TLS influence antitumor immune responses are only partially understood. Methods Clinically annotated tumor tissues of 27 patients with MCC were obtained prior to ICI therapy. Tumor samples were subjected to transcriptomic and multiplex immuno-visual profiling, T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotype mapping, as well as—in selected cases—spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively characterize the tumor immune microenvironment. Results Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of transcriptomic data in combination with topological overlap measures indicated a higher abundance of TLS in tumors of patients with MCC responding to ICI therapy. This concept was substantiated through immunomorphological analyses, revealing mature B-cell follicle-like structures characterized by high endothelial venules (HEVs). Further supporting HEVs as critical entry points for naïve T cells, the presence of TLS was correlated with a pronounced infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, exhibiting both naïve and central memory phenotypes. The TCR repertoire of these infiltrates exhibited enhanced richness and diversity with a pronounced reactivity toward Merkel cell polyomavirus-derived T-cell epitopes. Spatially resolved RNA and V(D)J sequencing revealed the expression of genes associated with T-cell recruitment within TLS, alongside the presence of naïve and central memory T-cell markers. Notably, individual clonally expanded TCR transcripts were detected both within TLS and among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The latter were associated with low expression of memory cell markers and high expression of effector cell markers. Additionally, a spatial gradient in the expression of genes linked to immune stress in MCC cells—such as those involved in the interferon-γ response and antigen processing and presentation machinery—originated in proximity to the TLS. Conclusion Our findings are consistent with a key role of TLS in shaping immune interactions within the MCC microenvironment, driving the recruitment of diverse tumor-reactive T cells. These insights hold promise for advancing immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite advancements in immunotherapies, the diversity of the tumor microenvironment remains a challenge for cancer treatment. To elucidate microenvironment‐specific differences in antitumor responses, we established patient‐derived ex vivo tumor‐lung slices. We analyzed immune activation profiles after treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 and the checkpoint inhibitor Nivolumab. Lung slices from non‐tumor, tumor‐adjacent, tumor‐border, and tumor‐central tissue were generated and assessed for viability, cell composition, and immune competence via flow cytometry, soluble factor secretion, and bulk RNA‐sequencing. The tumor‐border contained the highest number of immune cells (8.3‐fold vs. non‐tumor), secreted tumor markers (S100 and CA15‐3), and exhibited high levels of inflammatory mediators (IFNγ, IL‐6, and IL‐2). Treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 increased the frequency of CD137+/CD8+ T cells and induced cytokine responses dominated by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Granzyme B. While both non‐tumor and tumor‐border tissue responded to anti‐CD3/CD28, the intensities of immune responses were highly varied. Notably, treatment with Nivolumab induced an inflammatory response primarily in the tumor‐border evidenced by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Perforin secretion alongside increased expression of CD107a on CD8+ T cells, in a donor‐dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate how tumor‐border tissue slices can be utilized to study T cell responses in the context of the patient‐specific tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background Circulating platelets are increasingly recognized for their critical involvement in thromboinflammatory complications during respiratory infections, underscoring the importance of comprehending their dual role in immunomodulation and hemostasis. The multifaceted roles of platelets are attributed to their inherent heterogeneity, where the molecular diversity enables their functional versatility. However, research remains deficient in dissecting platelet heterogeneity within respiratory infection contexts, capturing the platelet subpopulations exhibiting specialized functional roles, and elucidating the therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Methods Leveraging the adequate platelet population detected through single-cell RNA sequencing, this study established stratified study cohorts central to: (1) COVID-19 disease severity, (2) therapeutic responsiveness, and (3) non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. An integrative annotation framework was implemented in this study, which encompassed co-expressed gene module identification, cell-cell communication network mapping, and cell trajectory assessment, to hierarchically dissect the functional dynamics of platelet heterogeneity in disease pathologies and their modulation by therapeutic interventions. Results This study unfolds six severity-associated platelet subpopulations, explores their modulation by corticosteroids and immune antibody treatments, and extends the findings to non-COVID-19 severe conditions. In severe COVID-19, platelet subpopulations with elevated innate immune responsiveness and high coagulation potential are intensively enriched, whereas following dexamethasone administration, this pro-coagulable subpopulation is remarkably repressed. Post-tocilizumab treatment, the instructive interaction from platelets to IFN-activated CD8+ T cells is reduced, while communications from memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells to platelets are enhanced. A platelet trajectory, which participates in neutrophil chemotaxis and B cell-mediated humoral responses, emerges specifically in COVID-19 conditions and is absent in non-COVID-19. Conclusions A systematic investigation of platelet transcriptomic heterogeneity in respiratory infections, combined with the delineation of its therapeutic modulation by dexamethasone and tocilizumab, advances the understanding of platelet involvement in immune-thrombotic dysregulation and provides a foundation for exploring potential therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Sweet syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory skin disorder characterized by erythematous plaques with a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. First-line therapy remains oral corticosteroids, which suppresses inflammation non-specifically. Although neutrophils are typically short-lived, how they persist in Sweet syndrome skin and contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized population of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like neutrophils expressing MHC class II genes that are uniquely present in Sweet syndrome skin but absent from healthy tissue and circulation. Keratinocytes extended neutrophil lifespan 10-fold in co-culture experiments and drove the emergence of an APC-like phenotype in approximately 30% of neutrophils, mirroring observations in patient lesions. Mechanistically, keratinocyte-derived serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) signals through the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on neutrophils to promote their survival. These long-lived neutrophils actively orchestrate local immune responses by recruiting T cells and inducing cytokine production. Strikingly, dual blockade of SAA1-FPR2 signaling restores neutrophil turnover to baseline levels, with efficacy comparable to high-dose corticosteroids. These findings uncover a keratinocyte-neutrophil-T cell axis that sustains chronic inflammation in Sweet syndrome and highlight the SAA1/FPR2 pathway as a promising target for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with favorable prognosis and positive response to immunotherapy in cancer. Here we show that simultaneous activation of innate immune effectors, STING and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR), results in CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor suppression while inducing high endothelial venule development and germinal center-like B cell responses in tumors to generate functional TLS in a T cell-dependent manner. In a neoadjuvant setting, activation of STING and LTβR by their agonists effectively immunized mice against tumor recurrence, leading to long-term survival. STING activation alone was insufficient for inducing B cell-containing TLS or eliciting long-term therapeutic effects. However, when combined with LTβR activation, it improved the fitness of TLS with B cell expansion and maturation to IgG-producing long-lived plasma cells and memory cells, increased CD4+ T cell recruitment and memory CD8+ T cell expansion, and shifted the TH2/TH17 balance, resulting in the potentiation of humoral and cellular immunity against tumors. These findings suggest a therapeutic approach of simultaneously activating STING and lymphotoxin pathways.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by dense stroma and myeloid-rich microenvironment that confer resistance to immunotherapies. Previous studies demonstrated that disrupting the immune-stroma CXCR4-CXCL12 axis facilitates T cell recruitment and mobility to collaborate with anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. We sought to test the clinical viability of this immunotherapeutic strategy. 21 patients with metastatic PDAC were enrolled and treated in a phase 2 trial evaluating the effects of the plerixafor/AMD3100 and cemiplimab. Primary endpoint was objective response rate. Blood and tissue biospecimens were collected for correlative analyses. Parallel mouse studies were used to determine potential mechanisms of resistance. Treatments were well-tolerated, but only two patients demonstrated a best response of stable disease. Correlative analyses confirmed significant mobilization of immune cells into circulation as well as increased immune infiltration into the tumor. High-parameter imaging revealed higher levels of CD8+ T cells but also granulocytes and macrophages upon treatment. Spatial analysis showed that treatment resulted in closer proximity between macrophages and T cells but not between granulocytes and T cells. Mouse studies revealed that whereas total granulocyte depletion had no effect on immunotherapeutic efficacy, macrophage-targeting yielded significant benefit. Tumor growth measurements and immune profiling of immunotherapeutic combinations incorporating macrophage-targeting showed that despite the increased T cell infiltration, CXCR4 antagonism was in fact associated with enrichment of CD206hiIA/IElo macrophage subtypes and modestly dampened efficacy. Our findings validate the utility of CXCR4 antagonism as an effective immune-recruiting platform but also underscores the need for strategies that better leverage its effects.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a first-line defender, has a multifaceted presence in chronic inflammation, autoimmune pathology, and tumor progression. The microenvironmental cues facilitate functional plasticity and phenotypic heterogeneity to neutrophils that enable both their protective and pathogenic roles. Autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) display the presence of dysregulated subsets of neutrophil, such as low-density granulocytes (LDGs) that promote proinflammation and contribute to tissue damage via NETosis and type I interferon-mediated signaling. In cancer, particularly tumors, they exhibit tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) which may polarize either towards anti-tumorigenic ‘N1’ or pro-tumorigenic ‘N2’ phenotypes based on available modulators such as TGF-β and leucine-driven epigenetic modifications. The development in neutrophil biology has introduced several novel therapeutic strategies that allow NET targeting, inhibition of chemokine receptors like CXCR2, and exploration of neutrophil-derived biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Such findings encourage the importance of neutrophils as both effectors and therapeutic targets in inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.">

        <tr id="Background: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is ominous in lung cancer patients. However, comprehensive studies of both innate and adaptive immune responses within the pleural tumor microenvironment remain limited. Methods: We collected samples from patients with heart failure and lung cancer-MPE. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed alternations in cancer cells, NK cells, DCs, and T cells. Key cytokines involving in cell-cell interactions were quantified using Luminex or ELISA, while HLA-E and aging markers were assessed via immunohistochemistry. Results: Our findings revealed that CD56⁺CD16⁺ and CD56⁻CD16⁻ NK cells exhibited reduced cytotoxicity, mainly through HLA-E-expressing senescent cancer cells interacting with NK cells inhibitory receptor, leading to NK cell dysfunction and reduced XCL2 expression, which might impair cDC1 recruitment. Consequently, aDC2 cells evolved into exhausted phenotype, resulting in inadequate T cell activation. In CD8 T cells, transcription factors such as FOXO1 contributed to diminished cytotoxicity. Despite presence of GZMA CD4 T cells, their cytotoxicity was suppressed in MPE. Th1-like and Th2-like regulatory T cells further inhibited CD4 T cell responses. Key molecules, CXCL16, BAG6, and IL-7, bridging innate and adaptive immunity conferred poor prognosis. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that senescent cancer cells promote immunoevasion through HLA-E, suppressing NK cell cytotoxicity, impairing DC function, and disrupting T cell activation. Cell-cell interaction and imbalanced Th1/Th2 contribute to microenvironmental remodeling, driving disease progression. These findings provide insights into the immunological landscape and therapeutic targets for intervention.">

        <tr id="Background Halo nevi are clinically common and are characterized by a circle of leukoderma around the central melanocytic nevus. Studies have shown that the pathogenesis of halo nevi is similar to that of vitiligo and is associated with the role of CD8⁺ T lymphocytes in melanocyte destruction. Histopathological findings have revealed neutrophil infiltration in halo nevi; however, the specific immune mechanisms involving neutrophils have not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, we investigated the role of neutrophils in halo nevi using histopathological and immunological analyses. Methods To this end, we examined the infiltration patterns of immune cells in halo nevi, with a particular focus on IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression in neutrophils and its potential immunoregulatory effects. Results The results demonstrated that IFN-γ expression in the lesional skin of halo nevi contributed to the induction of PD-L1 expression in neutrophils. PD-L1⁺ neutrophils promoted apoptosis and suppressed the function of CD8⁺ T lymphocytes. Notably, some halo nevi showed a tendency to spontaneous regression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and this regulatory mechanism influences the local immune response and may facilitate the repigmentation of the surrounding leukoderma in halo nevi. Conclusions This study is the first to explore the involvement of neutrophils in halo nevi and reveal the potential immunoregulatory role of PD-L1 in this process. The elucidation of this mechanism not only provides a more comprehensive understanding of autoimmune skin diseases but may also offer new strategies for targeted therapy in other related disorders, such as vitiligo.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary PIAS1 is a protein that helps control how cells behave, including how they respond to signals that can lead to cancer. While it has been studied in cancer cells before, we wanted to know what it does in the cells around the tumor, the tumor microenvironment, where immune and other supporting cells live. We found that higher levels of PIAS1 in these surrounding cells were linked to better survival in patients with oral cancer. By studying individual cells from tumors, we saw that PIAS1 was often found in immune and support cells and seemed to help these cells fight cancer. When PIAS1 was missing, the cells showed signs of being more friendly to the tumor and less active in fighting it. Overall, PIAS1 appears to play an important role in helping the body’s own cells resist cancer and could be a useful target for future treatments.">

        <tr id="CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells are essential for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing excessive inflammation, making them promising candidates for treating autoimmunity and GvHD. However, the translation of regulatory T cell therapy into clinical practice poses substantial challenges. Here, we show that adoptive regulatory T cell therapy increases IL-6 and TGF-β-dependent pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Regulatory T cells increase the p-stat3/p-stat5 ratio in effector T cells by suppressing IL-2 secretion and competitively consuming IL-2, thereby promoting Th17 cell differentiation. Notably, IL-2 signaling deficiency not only promotes a Th17 cell-associated transcriptional program, but also enhances the pro-inflammatory properties of Th17 cells. Strikingly, therapeutic blockade of IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway can reverse pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation and enhance the therapeutic effect of regulatory T cell therapy. Thus, our findings could potentially advance the clinical research progress of adoptive regulatory T cell therapy.">

        <tr id="The immune ecosystem is central to maintaining effective defensive responses. However, it remains largely understudied how immune cells in the peripheral blood interact with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastasis. Here, blood analysis of patients with advanced breast cancer revealed that over 75% of CTC-positive blood specimens contained heterotypic CTC clusters with CD45+ white blood cells (WBCs), which correlates with breast cancer subtypes, racial groups, and decreased survival. CTC-WBC clusters included overrepresented T cells and underrepresented neutrophils. Specifically, a rare subset of CD4 and CD8 double-positive T (DPT) cells was 140-fold enriched in CTC clusters versus their frequency in WBCs. DPT cells shared properties with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but exhibited unique features of T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. Mechanistically, the integrin heterodimer α4β1, also named very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), in DPT cells and its ligand, VCAM1, in tumor cells are essential mediators of DPT-CTC clusters. Neoadjuvant administration of anti-VLA-4 neutralizing antibodies markedly blocked CTC–DPT clusters, inhibited metastasis, and extended mouse survival. These findings highlight a pivotal role of rare DPT cells in fostering cancer dissemination through CTC clustering. It lays a foundation for developing innovative biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies to prevent and target cancer metastasis.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, accounting for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases. Characterized by low immunogenicity, SCLC may utilize epigenetic mechanisms to evade immune detection. Here, we demonstrate that entinostat, a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) upregulates immune-related genes in human SCLC cells. In vivo, we confirmed entinostat treatment increased expression of immunecheckpoint ligands and antigen presentation machinery in Myc-driven tumors in a Rb1/Trp53/MycT58A (RPM) SCLC mouse model, while shifting tumors from a neuroendocrine(NE)-high to a NE-low phenotype. Notably, combining entinostat with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy significantly enhances T-cell infiltration, suppresses tumor growth, and prolongs survival in RPM allograft models. These findings underscore the potential of entinostat to reprogram the immunological landscape and NE status of SCLC, enhance immune checkpoint blockade efficacy, and improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="The role of bone marrow (BM) compensatory response in autoimmune hemolytic anemias (AIHAs) is emerging and inadequate reticulocytosis has been associated with more severe disease and adverse outcomes. However, few is known about the BM immunologic microenvironment composition in these diseases. Here we investigated BM features in a large cohort of 97 patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and observed a high prevalence of hypercellularity, dyserythropoiesis, reticulin fibrosis, and T-cell infiltration (65%, 29%, 76%, and 69% of patients, respectively). These findings were associated with inadequate bone marrow compensation, more severe anemia at onset, and need of multiple treatments. In a subset of warm type AIHA patients we investigated BM microenvironment by single-cell RNA sequencing. We found distinct immune cell profiles across disease stages (diagnosis, remission, relapse). In particular, upregulation of inflammatory response pathways was noted in CD8 + , CD4 + , and monocyte subsets during relapse compared to diagnosis and remission. Moreover, by single-cell TCR sequencing, we found small T cell clones at diagnosis that may either disappeared or expanded at remission. Disappearing clones exhibited a naive CD8+ phenotype and were more likely to respond to glucocorticoid treatment. Expanding clones showed upregulation of cytotoxic T cell markers and may play a role in the transition to a chronic/relapsing phase. Finally, cytokine gene expression differed across disease phases. At relapse, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 were upregulated in CD4+ and CD8 + T cells, while TGF-beta was downregulated, potentially in an attempt to counteract the transition to chronic phase. This is the largest study evaluating BM histology and clinical characteristics, and the first evaluation of BM microenvironment by single-cell RNA sequencing in AIHA. We showed a complex scenario encompassing T-cell infiltration, clonality, and up/down-regulation of cytokine genes, associated with a more severe and relapsing disease.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial part of the innate immune system and serve as an important effector for killing tumor cells through direct cytolytic activity or immunomodulatory signaling to T cells and antigen presenting cells. NK cells are correlated with increased tumor control and better overall patient survival across various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite their promising potential for anti-tumor killing, NK cell function is often diminished within the tumor microenvironment. There are many factors that lead to decreased tumor-infiltrating NK cell killing, including immunoinhibitory factors from tumor cells and resident tissues, acquired immune tolerance, NK cell exhaustion, and the hypoxic state of the tumor microenvironment. Unleashing NK cell activity therefore has high potential to create a new class of immunotherapy that could combat both primary and acquired resistance to current checkpoint inhibitors. In this review we discuss mechanistic details of NK cell tumor killing, NK cell immunosuppression, and gaps in knowledge regarding highly complex microenvironment-specific effects on NK cell function. We also discuss the promise and limitations of emerging NK-cell based therapeutic strategies.">

PCa in PTEN(i)pe−/− is marked by the recruitment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), which represent the dominant immune cell population and resolved into eight distinct states, Trem2+ tumor-associated-macrophages (TAMs), and exhausted CD8+ T cells. Trem2+ TAMs differ from the three main resident macrophage populations in the healthy prostate, exhibiting a strong metabolic and immunosuppressive signature, likely driven by the MIF/HIF1A-signaling axis.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has the potential to influence tumor development and affect the efficacy of cancer therapeutics, particularly immunotherapy. However, the specific species and strains rather than all microbes that promote antitumor immunity by modulating the function of systemic immunity or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumor environments remain to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the microbiome composition of responders and non-responders to PD-1 blockade therapy from a clinical cohort and found that Enterococcus spp. were abundant in the responders. Through in vitro screening, we identified Enterococcus lactis MNC-168, a commensal bacterium isolated from a healthy individual, which significantly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment by promoting antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, MNC-168 activates innate immunity through a STING-IFN-I (stimulator of interferon genes-type I interferons) dependent pathway by releasing bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs), and targeting tumor tissue, thereby augmenting the antitumor immune response. Furthermore, we have confirmed the safety profile of MNC-168 and its enhancing effect on Anti-PD-1 activity across multiple preclinical models, as well as its potential clinical relevance to Anti-PD-1 therapy. These findings suggest that MNC-168 could represent a promising strategy for cancer therapy and has the potential to improve the efficacy of current immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Since their discovery, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as key players in immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. Early research focused on defining ILC subsets, including ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, by distinguishing their development, transcriptional profiles, and effector functions relative to T cells. Subsequent studies characterized the tissue-resident nature of ILCs and mapped their context-dependent phenotypes across diverse organs. In parallel, increasing evidence linked ILC subset imbalances to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and various cancers. Recent work has leveraged circulating ILC frequencies and phenotypes as potential biomarkers for disease severity and progression. Notably, the immunomodulatory, tissue-reparative, and cytotoxic functions of helper ILCs have attracted interest as novel therapeutic avenues. Current strategies to harness ILCs for therapy include ex vivo expansion of autologous or allogeneic ILCs, derivation of ILC-like cells from umbilical cord blood or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), and engineering of ILCs with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to enhance antigen specificity. Additionally, cytokine modulation and immune checkpoint blockade are being explored to sustain or redirect ILC function in disease contexts. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the functional diversity, plasticity, and tissue residency of ILC subsets, emphasizing their interactions with other immune and stromal cells, and their roles as predictive, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases and cancers. Key translational challenges, including subset heterogeneity, plasticity, tissue-restricted residency, and limited scalability, remain barriers to clinical application. However, emerging multi-omic technologies, single-cell atlases, and synthetic biology approaches are accelerating efforts to map ILC states with unprecedented resolution and guide rational therapeutic design. Looking forward, integration of ILC-based therapies with regenerative medicine, cellular engineering, and immuno-oncology platforms holds promise for developing next-generation precision immunotherapies. By bridging fundamental biology with translational innovation, this field is poised to expand the therapeutic landscape for both autoimmune and malignant diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapies that induce immunogenic cell death such as necroptosis can arm the immune system to clear residual tumor cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling can trigger necroptosis, orchestrating immune responses to solid tumors. Whether RIPK3 activity can be exploited for controlling B cell malignancies remains unclear. Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition. Exploiting these findings, we showed that a combination therapy activating RIPK3 with SMAC mimetics while suppressing caspase activity and providing type I IFN resulted in immune-mediated control of B cell tumors. Hence, reprogramming RIPK3 activity represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity to target B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Although checkpoint immunotherapy has primarily focused on CD8⁺ T cells, emerging evidence highlights an important role for cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in mediating therapeutic responses. However, research on the functional properties of cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in the context of immunotherapy is still at an early stage and remains insufficiently defined. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from metastatic melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, we performed transcriptomic profiling of conventional CD4⁺ T cells, excluding proliferative and regulatory (FOXP3⁺) subsets, and compared responders and non-responders as distinct groups. Importantly, our analysis identified distinct clusters that discriminate between responders and non-responders, with cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells occupying a central position within these clusters. In responder-specific clusters, cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells exhibited features of early activation, whereas clusters specific to non-responders were characterized by an exhausted phenotype. Notably, non-responder-specific clusters were positioned proximally to Treg-like clusters, suggesting a potential transition from cytotoxic to regulatory CD4⁺ T cell states in non-responders. Our findings reinforce the emerging concept that cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells play a central role in mediating immunotherapy responses. These results provide a foundation for the development of predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating CD4⁺ T cell differentiation.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The sustained effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) treatment is limited to a subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, highlighting the need to identify targetable biomarkers that synergize with PD1 blockade. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in HCC progression, along with growing evidence indicating its complex immunomodulatory effects within the tumor microenvironment. However, the interplay between cholesterol homeostasis and immune evasion remains elusive. Methods Transcriptomic and clinical data from HCC datasets were analyzed to identify cholesterol metabolism-related targets. Multiplex immunostaining and flow cytometry were applied to examine the immune landscape association with squalene epoxidase (SQLE) in human and murine tumors. Mechanistic studies were conducted in vitro, and co-culture experiments of tumor cells and T cells were followed by metabolomics and transcriptome analyses. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in mouse HCC models. Results We demonstrated that elevated SQLE expression in human HCC was associated with poor clinical outcomes and correlated with reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of SQLE in tumor cells promoted CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation in co-culture experiments. Untargeted metabolomics identified 27-hydrocholesterol, an oxysterol derived from tumor cells, as a key factor impairing CD8+ T cell function via cholesterol dysregulation. SQLE inhibition in tumor cells suppressed oxysterols secretion, therefore overcoming cholesterol restrictions and enhancing the immune responses of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, SQLE targeting with terbinafine restored antitumor immunity and synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in HCC. Conclusion Targeting tumorous SQLE restores CD8+ T cell function by overcoming cholesterol restrictions via oxysterol-SREBP2 signaling, highlighting SQLE as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immunotherapy has revolutionised melanoma treatment, providing significant clinical benefits by reactivating the anti‐tumour immune system. CD8+ tissue‐resident memory T lymphocytes (CD8+ TRM) have emerged as crucial mediators of anti‐tumour immunity, while their specific role in melanoma remains poorly understood. Methods Following CD8+CD45.1+ OT‐1 cell adoptive transfer into CD45.2+ mice, we employed magnetic separation to purify and analyse resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRM). We use multiple immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to evaluate the spatial distribution of CD8+ TRM in ZS melanoma cohort. Additionally, the biological function of CD8+ TRM and their impact on anti‐tumour immunity are explored using scRNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, coupled with in vivo/in vitro experiments. Finally, CD8+ TRM utility as an immunotherapy response predictor is examined across several independent cohorts. Results CD8+ TRM demonstrates potent tumour‐killing capabilities in melanoma, with CD103 as a distinctive marker. High CD103+CD8+ TRM infiltration in tumour tissues strongly correlates with improved prognosis in melanoma patients. In vivo adoptive transfer of CD103+CD8+ TRM effectively inhibits melanoma progression. Mechanistically, CD103 activates the integrin‐dependent PI3K/AKT signalling cascade, promoting both proliferation and anti‐tumour effector functions of CD8+ TRM. Notably, CD103+CD8+ TRM preferentially localises within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and its adoptive transfer promotes TLS formation. Clinically, CD103+CD8+ TRM is enriched in immunotherapy‐responsive patients and serves as a strong predictor for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment outcomes. Conclusions CD103+ CD8+ TRM cells in melanoma play a key role in the anti‐tumour immune process and can also be used as a reliable predictor of immunotherapy efficacy. Key points CD103 is a reliable marker of tissue‐resident memory (TRM) CD8+ T cells in melanoma. CD103+CD8+ TRM cells exhibit potent anti‐tumour immune activity. CD103+CD8+ TRM cells predict favourable responses to immunotherapy in melanoma.">

        <tr id="Background The immune-balancing role of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) is well-recognized in contexts of immune dysregulation. Within the anti-tumor context, Tα1 demonstrated to act as an immune-enhancer, with potential roles in immunotherapy-based treatments. However, Tα1 immunomodulatory potential on tumor cells is poorly understood. Additionally, Tα1 pleiotropic effects on immune cells require in-depth investigations to unravel its specific impact on different immune cell populations. Thus, we first aimed to investigate whether Tα1 treatments influenced the transcriptional immune profile of various cancer cell lines. Alongside, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B, and natural killer cells from healthy donors (HDs) were treated individually with Tα1, to assess its direct effects on each immune cell population. Methods Cutaneous melanoma, glioblastoma, and pleural mesothelioma cell lines and HD immune cell subsets were treated with Tα1 for 48 hours. Total RNA was subsequently isolated, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by the nCounter® SPRINT Profiler. Genes with a log2ratio ≥0.58 and ≤−0.58 in Tα1-treated vs untreated cells were defined as differentially expressed (DEGs) and subsequently evaluated for the enrichment of Gene Ontology terms to identify biological processes potentially affected by Tα1 in tumor and immune cells. Results Tα1 minimally changed cancer cell DEGs and immune-related biological processes, suggesting a comprehensive lack of transcriptional immunomodulatory potential on the tumor counterpart. Conversely, Tα1 exhibited to directly affect the proliferation and/or transcription processes of each studied immune cell subset, with the greatest transcriptional impact observed for activated CD8+ T cells, crucial players in anti-tumor immunity. Conclusion Our findings question the tumor immunomodulatory properties of Tα1, simultaneously underscoring the importance of further investigating Tα1 influence on specific immune cell subsets in the periphery or within the tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. This would contribute to understand Tα1 potential in immunotherapy-based combination strategies, within the anti-tumor setting.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by aberrant T cell activity and excessive autoantibody production. Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) play a pivotal role in promoting B cell-mediated autoantibody generation, contributing to SLE progression. Although mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) exhibit immunomodulatory properties, their effects on Tfh in SLE and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this, we first analyzed sorted Tfh from an imiquimod-induced lupus murine model (IMQ-SLE) and found that MSC-Exos effectively suppressed Tfh function. Consistently, Tfh polarization assays demonstrated that MSC-Exos modulate Tfh differentiation in vitro. Subsequently, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of intravenous MSC-Exos administration and confirmed that MSC-Exos markedly inhibited Tfh expansion and function in vivo. Further RNA sequencing followed by validation experiments identified that MSC-Exos restore calcium homeostasis in Tfh. Mechanically, MSC-Exos down-regulate stromal interaction molecule 1 (Stim1) and Orai1 expression, inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. In parallel, MSC-Exos mitigate calcium overload-induced mitochondrial damage by suppressing mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) expression. Finally, we observed that MSC-Exos also promote the differentiation of follicular regulatory T cells (Tfr) both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that MSC-Exos ameliorate SLE by correcting cellular calcium dysregulation and mitochondrial damage in Tfh while simultaneously restoring the Tfh/Tfr imbalance, highlighting their potential as a therapeutic strategy for SLE.">

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis (LN), a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), involves complex immune dysregulation that leads to chronic renal inflammation and progressive tissue damage. Despite decades of use of standard immunosuppressive therapy, treatment responses remain variable, and many patients experience relapses or develop end-stage renal disease. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the immunopathogenesis of LN, drawing on studies from single-cell transcriptomics, signaling pathway analyses and renal tissue immunology. It examines the role of both innate and adaptive immune cells in mediating disease. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving with novel biologics targeting B cell survival and cytokine signaling, small-molecule inhibitors modulating intracellular pathways, and promising developments in cell-based interventions. Notably, recent clinical case series have demonstrated that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable drug-free remission in LN, representing a transformative approach to immune modulation. These advances are further supported by the application of multi-omics platforms to refine biomarker-driven disease monitoring and personalized treatment. Integrating immunologic and technological innovations holds the potential to redefine therapeutic strategies in LN. Precision medicine approaches that leverage targeted therapies, immune resetting modalities, and biomarker-guided clinical decisions may significantly improve long-term renal outcomes and patient quality of life.">

        <tr id="The tumour microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic environment containing diverse cellular, stromal and soluble factors, that collectively influence cancer progression, immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Among the immune components of the TME, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells are key players, whose interactions, particularly their crosstalk, critically shape anti-tumour immunity. The macrophage–NK cell interplay can either promote or suppress immune responses depending on the context, representing both a challenge and a therapeutic opportunity. NK cells are key effectors capable of recognising and eliminating malignant cells without prior sensitisation, whereas macrophages exhibit remarkable plasticity, functioning as either promoters or suppressors of tumour immunity depending on their activation state. This review focuses on current strategies to harness macrophages in cancer therapy, including phenotype repolarisation, selective depletion, and disruption or enhancement of the macrophage-NK cell crosstalk to enhance NK cell-mediated tumour surveillance. Finally, we highlight emerging technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics, as powerful tools to elucidate the dynamic interplay between macrophages and NK cells and inform the next generation of immunotherapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Background Trained immunity with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSC) is a promising approach to liver regeneration. This study aimed to clarify the trained-hBMSC (T-hBMSC) in restoring tissue immuno-microenvironment in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) mice. Methods hBMSC trained with tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ were phenotypically characterized in vitro. FHF mouse models were established in male Balb/c mice via tail vein injection of concanavalin A. The therapeutic potential of T-hBMSC was evaluated through transplantation into FHF mice. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanism of liver regeneration post-transplantation of T-hBMSC. Results T-hBMSC with the characteristics of trilineage differentiation potential showed that pro-inflammatory (IL1β, IL8, both p < 0.0001) and immunoregulatory genes (PDL1, IDO1, both p < 0.0001) were significantly upregulated compared to untrained-hBMSC (UT-hBMSC). Time-trajectory analysis revealed downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (IL6, IL8, and IL1α) and upregulation of immunomodulatory genes (IDO1) in T-hBMSC upon mimic-stimulation, characterized by distinct transcriptional programs. The liver function (ALT, AST) and inflammatory cytokines (IL6, MCP1, both p < 0.01) levels were significantly improved in the T-hBMSC-treated mice. The survival status of the T-hBMSC group was superior to the UT-hBMSC group, although there was no statistical significance. Histological analysis confirmed reduced necrosis and fewer infiltrating CD45+ immune cells in the T-hBMSC-treated mice. Significant downregulation of immune response (TNF & IL-17 signaling pathways and neutrophil chemotaxis) and upregulation of metabolic pathways were observed in the T-hBMSC group, associated with enhanced liver regeneration. The proportion of anti-inflammatory F4/80+CD163+ macrophages was increased in the liver of T-hBMSC group. Conclusion T-hBMSC exhibited enhanced immunomodulation, effectively rescuing liver failure and reducing inflammation via restoring the immune-microenvironment. These findings highlighted the potential of trained immunity as a novel strategy for the treatment of liver failure.

        <tr id="Inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), are markedly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis (ICI-M). Endomyocardial biopsies from these patients also show GBP-associated inflammasome overexpression. While both factors are implicated in ICI-M pathophysiology, their interplay and cellular targets remain poorly characterized. Our aim was to elucidate how ICI-M-associated cytokines affect the viability and inflammatory responses of endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models. ECs and CMs were differentiated from the same hiPSC line derived from a healthy donor. Cells were exposed either to IFN-γ alone or to an inflammatory cytokine cocktail (CCL5, GZMB, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α). We assessed large-scale transcriptomic changes via microarray and evaluated inflammatory, apoptotic, and cell death pathways at cellular and molecular levels. hiPSC-ECs were highly sensitive to cytokine exposure, displaying significant mortality and marked transcriptomic changes in immunity- and inflammation-related pathways. In contrast, hiPSC-CM showed limited transcriptional changes and reduced susceptibility to cytokine-induced death. In both cell types, cytokine treatment upregulated key components of the inflammasome pathway, including regulators (GBP5, GBP6, P2X7, NLRC5), a core component (AIM2), and the effector GSDMD. Increased GBP5 expression and CASP-1 cleavage mirrored the findings found elsewhere in endomyocardial biopsies from ICI-M patients. This hiPSC-based model reveals a distinct cellular sensitivity to ICI-M-related inflammation, with endothelial cells showing heightened vulnerability. These results reposition endothelial dysfunction, rather than cardiomyocyte injury alone, as a central mechanism in ICI-induced myocarditis. Modulating endothelial inflammasome activation, particularly via AIM2 inhibition, could offer a novel strategy to mitigate cardiac toxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy.">

        <tr id="B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). As a receptor of prostaglandin D2, chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2) is known to be involved in Th2 cell activation, but its function in B lymphocytes is unclear. Here, we show that CRTH2 is critical for an IL-1β-producing B cell subset. Mice with B-cell-specific deletion of Crth2 exhibit reduced numbers of IL-1β-producing B cells, resulting in amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal animal model of MS. Compared to wild-type B cells, adoptive transfer of Crth2-deficient B cells attenuates EAE disease severity in B-cell-deficient recipient mice. The IL-1β-producing B cell subpopulation was mainly transitional type 2 B cells identified by flow cytometry and single cell sequencing. Mechanically, CRTH2 promotes IL-1β production in B cells through p38 signaling, and pharmacological inhibition of p38 attenuates EAE disease severity in DK-PGD2-treated mice. Taken together, our results reveal a key function of CRTH2 in driving IL-1β expression in B cells and in controlling their pathogenic activity in autoimmune diseases.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in cancer progression and immune modulation, critically influencing the efficacy of ICIs. Recent advances in single‐cell technologies have enabled high‐resolution profiling of the TME, particularly tumor‐infiltrating immune cells, across diverse cancer types. However, our understanding of how immune cells shape ICI responses and how they are dynamically altered during treatment remains incomplete. In this review, we summarize recent progress in characterizing TME features associated with ICI responsiveness, highlighting key immune cell subsets involved in ICI therapy and emphasizing their phenotypic plasticity and functional adaptability following ICIs. Additionally, we outline the spatial architecture of the TME in terms of its effects on immune cell behavior and interactions, and discuss the critical role of stromal components and the microbiota in modulating the immune landscape and influencing ICI responsiveness. By integrating these insights, we aim to deepen our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ICI responses, elucidate determinants of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance, and inform the development of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, and accounts for the majority of malaria-associated mortality. Reducing the overwhelming inflammatory responses in the early stage of infection is a key point to prevent death due to CM. In this study, we found that neutrophil mobilization occurred rapidly in response to Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in a murine CM model. Depletion of neutrophils protected the infected mice from neuropathology, with low infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells in the brain, and attenuated activation of dendritic cell (DC) and parasite-specific T cell responses in the spleen. Flow cytometry analysis showed that following PbA infection the expression of TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 were increased in splenic DC, while only TLR9 expression was reduced after the depletion of neutrophils. To validate the TLR9-dependent activation between neutrophils and DC, we used neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to stimulate bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) from WT and Tlr9−/− mice. The results showed that the DNA component of NETs activates DCs through the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to upregulated expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which was abolished by DNase I. BMDC stimulated by NETs promoted CD8+ T cell activation with TLR9 dependence. Inhibiting NETs with Sivelestat effectively impeded the onset and progression of CM in the PbA infected mice. Collectively, our results indicated that neutrophil cell death (NETosis) induced TLR9-dependent DC activation and pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses, revealing that the NETs-TLR9/NF-κB-DC-CD8+ T cell axis may provide novel insights into the immunopathogenic mechanisms of CM.

        <tr id="Invasive candidiasis, primarily caused by Candida albicans, represents the most common fungal disease among hospitalized patients and poses a significant threat to human health. Intrinsic or acquired immunosuppression serves as a critical risk factor predisposing individuals to this disease, while simultaneously reducing the efficacy of conventional antifungal therapies and worsening clinical outcomes. Given the central role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of invasive candidiasis, immunotherapeutic strategies hold substantial promise. We targeted dectin-1, the primary pattern recognition receptor for β-1,3-glucan, by engineering XJ104, a bispecific T-cell engager that fuses dectin-1 to the light chains of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. This construct is designed to bridge Candida β-1,3-glucan with CD3 on T cells, thereby inducing anti-Candida immunity. Our results demonstrate that XJ104 exhibits high specificity for β-1,3-glucan and activates effector cells in a Candida-dependent manner in vitro. In murine models, XJ104 enhances Th1 and Th17 responses and confers significant protection against both C. albicans and non-albicans infections. Crucially, CD3+ T-cell depletion and cytokine neutralization abolished this protection, confirming the T-cell-dependent protective efficacy of XJ104. These results establish that enhancing the endogenous T-cell function represents an effective strategy against invasive candidiasis. In conclusion, our study presents a novel therapeutic approach that bridges T cells and Candida pathogens, promoting robust Candida-specific immunity and controlling invasive infections caused by Candida spp. These findings underscore the potential of XJ104 as a clinically promising immunotherapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.">

To determine whether these effects are direct or indirect, we utilized an in vitro murine bone marrow–derived macrophage (BMDM) model, which recapitulates macrophage differentiation and polarization processes, to examine the impact of DON on the M1 macrophages. DON was applied during M1 differentiation or to fully polarized M1 macrophages, revealing that glutamine inhibition initially suppressed M1 activity but later enhanced it, resulting in sustained pro-inflammatory activation. Multi-omics analyses (bulk RNA-seq and LC-MS), time-course assays, and glutamine depletion experiments consistently suggested that prolonged glutamine inhibition elevates glutamine levels, which sustain pro-inflammatory gene transcription. In contrast, M2 and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which are immunosuppressive, were more susceptible to DON, leading to functional suppression. Collectively, our findings uncover stage-specific mechanisms by which glutamine inhibition modulates M1 polarization, offering a mechanistic rationale for therapeutic strategies that sustain pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor macrophage activity while concurrently suppressing immunosuppressive myeloid subsets in cancer.">

Here, we present a novel strategy harnessing acute transplant rejection mechanisms by employing a recombinant oncolytic rVMG vector engineered to express the murine H-2Kk MHC class I alloantigen (rVMG-H-2Kk), thereby inducing tumor-specific antigenic mismatch responses. In vitro, rVMG-H-2Kk exhibited strong replication and cytolytic activity while inducing cell surface expression of both H-2Kk and endogenous H-2Kb, in addition to upregulation of antigen presentation genes (β2-microglobulin, Tap1, and Tapbp). In two independent immunocompetent PDAC models, intratumoral and systemic delivery of rVMG-H-2Kk delayed tumor progression and prolonged survival. Multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunophenotyping revealed substantial TME remodeling, marked by increased effector T-cell infiltration, regulatory T-cell depletion, and reduced fibrosis. Spatial transcriptomics further showed compartment-specific immune activation and epithelial metabolic reprogramming, corroborating with enhanced tumor immunogenicity. Despite these effects, rVMG-H-2Kk also induced compensatory immunosuppressive pathways, including upregulation of antiviral response genes and immune checkpoint receptors such as PDL-2. Importantly, combination therapy with rVMG-H-2Kk and murine checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) drastically improved survival than checkpoint blockade alone. Strikingly, surviving mice resisted tumor rechallenge, indicating the establishment of durable antitumor memory. Collectively, these findings establish rVMG-H-2Kk as a novel immunotherapeutic platform capable of converting immune-cold tumors into immune-hot, sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and establishing durable antitumor immunity in PDAC.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by sustained synovial inflammation and the gradual destruction of joint structures. Although conventional T cells have historically been viewed as central to RA pathogenesis, increasing attention has recently focused on unconventional T cell subsets, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and gamma delta T (γδ T) cells. Functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, these cells contribute to RA immunopathogenesis by producing cytokines, exerting cytotoxic effects, and interacting with various immune and stromal cells. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the immunological characteristics and pathogenic roles of unconventional T cell subsets in RA. NKT, MAIT, and γδ T cells contribute to the amplification of inflammatory responses and joint tissue destruction through diverse mechanisms, exhibiting unique tissue tropism and functional plasticity. Recently, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed to target these subsets, including modulation of antigen presentation pathways, inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, and reprogramming of cellular functionalities. Advancements in single-cell omics and spatial immune profiling have facilitated the precise identification and characterization of pathogenic unconventional T cell subsets in the RA synovium, thereby paving the way for personalized immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), traditionally characterized in innate immune cells, are emerging as critical modulators of T cell function. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), STING, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and natural killer receptors (NKRs) are expressed by CD8+ T cells, where they influence various cellular responses. Primarily serving as noncanonical costimulatory signals, TLRs can modulate T cell activation, differentiation, metabolic fitness, and memory formation. RLRs and STING can promote T cell expansion and cytokine production. Both activating and inhibitory NKRs can also alter T cell cytotoxicity and differentiation. As demonstrated in recent advancements, the capacity of these signaling cascades to enhance T cell responses offers promising therapeutic opportunities in cancer. Clinical strategies are being developed to selectively harness each of these pathways, such as TLR and STING agonists to bolster antitumor responses, and NKR-based approaches to amplify cytotoxic function. Additionally, adoptive T cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, are incorporating these innate signaling components to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression, enhance functional longevity, and improve therapeutic efficacy. This review discusses the progress made to characterize the role of T cell intrinsic PRR activity in shaping T cell functions and highlights recent advancements in that leverage innate receptor signaling to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are highly plastic immune cells that adopt diverse functional states in response to the local microenvironment. The traditional M1/M2 polarization model that has long been used to describe macrophage activation is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of macrophage diversity observed in vivo. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed that macrophages exist in a continuum of transcriptional states formed by tissue-specific and disorder-specific cues. This insight has led to the recognition of disorder-specific macrophages, defined as macrophage subpopulations that emerge in response to pathological stimuli and play unique roles in disease progression. These macrophages exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures, epigenetic modifications, and functional properties shaped by their ontogeny and microenvironmental signals, arising from the reprogramming of resident macrophages or the differentiation of bone marrow–derived progenitors. Notable examples include macrophages in chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis), immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, lipid-associated macrophages in obesity, and disease-associated microglia in neurodegeneration. These subsets exhibit unique regulatory mechanisms, including enhancer remodeling driven by histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, CCAAT enhancer binding protein α-mediated differentiation in obesity, and Jmjd3-IRF4 axis control in allergic inflammation. Additionally, their function and fate are strongly influenced by their subtissular niche, as evidenced by crown-like structures in adipose tissue, tumor microenvironments, fibrotic lesions, and granulomas, where distinct microenvironmental cues shape macrophage behavior. Furthermore, interindividual heterogeneity in macrophage function, driven by genetic polymorphisms, is increasingly recognized, highlighting the role of host genetic background in disease susceptibility and macrophage-driven pathology. Here, we review the conceptual evolution of the disorder-specific macrophage, tracing its origins from the limited M1/M2 model to its refinement through scRNA-seq-based classification. We summarize the ontogeny, transcriptional regulation, and spatial heterogeneity of these macrophages across various disorders, emphasizing how the subtissular niche dictates functional specialization. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting disorder-specific macrophage subsets, highlighting the need for integrative multi-omics approaches to refine their classification and functional characterization. Understanding the regulatory networks that govern disorder-specific macrophages will advance our knowledge of macrophage biology while facilitating the development of precision medicine for immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the most formidable infectious diseases globally. The immune system orchestrates a complex response including, but not limited to, T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) to control and eliminate Mtb. While these cells are well-recognized for their roles in anti-tumor immunity, their contributions to the defense against Mtb are equally critical. This review delves into the specific mechanisms by which these immune cells release cytotoxic enzymes and effector molecules, offering new insights into their pivotal roles in Mtb clearance. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms is essential for developing more effective strategies to combat tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Senescent immune cells secrete varied inflammatory factors that weaken the systemic anti-tumor ability and promote the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Tumor cells could also accelerate the immune cellular senescence through diverse mechanisms. However, there has been a lack of indicators to quantify the senescence levels of different immune cell types. A model for Identifying Senescent Immune Cells and Samples was developed to explore the role of senescent immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). By integrating bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, we constructed immune cell gene expression profiles for 23 cancer types using a deconvolution algorithm. By calculating the cellular senescence scores, we found that tumor samples exhibited higher senescence levels than normal samples. Monocytes/macrophages were prone to co-senescence with other cell subtypes. Differentially expressed genes in the high- and low-immune cellular senescence scores groups were enriched in the senescence pathway. Patients with higher levels of immunosenescence were associated with better prognosis. At the single-cell level, the number and strength of cell-to-cell interactions increased following immune cellular senescence in most cancers. Samples with senescent immune cells exhibited poorer immunotherapy response. Our study advances our understanding of senescent immune cells in the TIME, provides insights into cancer-specific relationships between immune cellular senescence and immune characteristics, and offers a model for identifying these senescent immune cells.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer represents a typically immune “cold” tumor, where obvious immunosuppression, spatial T-cell exclusion, and cellular dysfunction collectively limit immunotherapy effectiveness. Especially in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the immune low-response state is driven by complex interactions among tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), suppressive stromal networks, and the T-cell compartment (regulatory T cells, Tregs, and exhausted effector T cells). Emerging multi-omics technologies—particularly single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics—have showed the heterogeneity and spatial immune organization underlying this suppressed state. Here, we integrate these datasets to describe TAM phenotypes and spatial niches, T-cell exhaustion, Tregs accumulation, NK-cell dysfunction, and stromal barriers that enforce exclusion. We then derive phenotype-guided combination strategies to remodel the tumor microenvironment and improve responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. This synthesis provides a concise, multi-dimensional framework for precision immunotherapy and for overcoming resistance in immune-low ovarian cancers.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening complications that can arise following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). GVHD occurs when immune cells—primarily T cells—from the graft recognize host cells as foreign entities and initiate an immune response against host tissues. This immune reaction generally involves a diverse array of cytokines, including interleukins (ILs), which play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response, promoting inflammation, and sustaining immune tolerance. Members of the interleukin family are not only directly involved in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells but also regulate inflammatory responses and the migration of immune cells. Consequently, they significantly influence both the clinical manifestations and prognosis of GVHD. The objective of this study is to review recent advancements in research concerning interleukins and their role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. This study aims to elucidate how interleukins contribute to immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, we will discuss their potential as therapeutic targets, with the intention of providing novel insights and strategies for the clinical management of GVHD.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
While highly efficacious for numerous cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause unpredictable and potentially severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), underscoring the need to understand irAE biology.


METHODS
We used a multidimensional approach incorporating single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiling to characterize the peripheral immune landscape of patients receiving ICI therapy according to irAE development.


RESULTS
Analysis of 162 patients revealed that individuals who developed clinically significant irAEs exhibited a baseline proinflammatory, autoimmune-like state characterized by a significantly higher abundance of CD57+ T and natural killer (NK) T cells, plasmablasts, proliferating and activated CXCR3+ lymphocytes, CD8+ effector and terminal effector memory T cells, along with reduced NK cells and elevated plasma ANA levels. In irAE cases, we identified distinct baseline proinflammatory gene signatures, including markedly higher expression of IL1B and CXCL8 in monocytes and CXCR3, TNF, and IFNG in T/NK cells. TNF signaling was the most enriched pathway, while immunosuppressive genes SIGLEC7 and CXCR4 were downregulated. Following ICI initiation, these patients exhibited an enhanced shift toward an activated and inflammatory immune phenotype, including monocyte reprogramming characterized by upregulation of IL18 and elevated gene expression levels of CXCL10. Conversely, post-treatment levels of CXCL8 were decreased in irAE patients. Notably, in patients who did not develop clinically significant irAE, we identified increased baseline abundance of a TGFBIhigh myeloid cluster enriched in immunosuppressive markers such as STAB1. In addition, patients without irAE exhibited upregulation of TNF and AIRE, accompanied by distinct myeloid protumorigenic reprogramming.


CONCLUSIONS
A pre-existing activated, autoimmune-like proinflammatory state drives the development of irAE during ICI therapy through three key axes: increased plasmablast/ANA, heightened interferon-gamma/CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, and amplified TNF signaling. These findings may serve as potential peripheral immune biomarkers for predicting irAE and provide biological insights into the mechanisms governing and mitigating irAE.">

However, effects of irradiation on senescence and SASP in human tissue and in the context of particle radiotherapy remain unclear. Here, we analyzed chemokine patterns after radiotherapy of human pancreatic tumors and cancer cell lines. We show that irradiated tumor cells coexpressed SASP chemokines in defined modules. These chemokine modules correlated with infiltration of distinct leukocyte subtypes expressing cognate receptors. We developed a patient-derived pancreatic tumor explant system, which verified our identified radiation-induced chemokine modules. Chemokine modules were partially conserved in cancer cells in response to photon and particle irradiation, showing a dose-dependent plateau effect, and induced subsequent migration of NK and T cell populations. Hence, our work reveals redundant interactions of cancer cells and immune cells in human tissue, suggesting that targeting multiple chemokines is required to efficiently perturb leukocyte infiltration after photon or particle radiotherapy.">

However, the influence of distinct tissue environments on the differentiation and clonal selection of polyclonal T cells remains unclear, primarily because of the technical challenges in tracking these cells in vivo. To address this question, we generated Tracking Recently Activated Cell Kinetics (TRACK) mice, a dual-recombinase fate-mapping system that enables precise spatial and temporal labeling of recently activated CD4+ T cells. Using TRACK mice during influenza infection, we observed organ-specific clonal selection and transcriptional differentiation in the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes (medLNs), and spleen. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing revealed that local antigenic landscapes and clonal identity shape repertoire diversity, resulting in a low clonal overlap between tissues during acute infection. During the effector phase, spleen-derived CD4+ T cells preferentially adopted a stem-like migratory phenotype, whereas those activated in the medLNs predominantly differentiated into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Memory formation was associated with increased clonal overlap between lung and medLN-derived cells, whereas splenic clones retained a distinct repertoire. Additionally, memory CD4+ T cells displayed converging antigen specificity across tissues over time. These results highlight the tissue-dependent mechanisms driving clonal selection and functional specialization during infection and underscore how memory development facilitates clonal redistribution and functional convergence.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), comprising up to 50% of the tumor mass, are recruited via chemokine axes such as CCL2/CCR2, CX3CL1/CX3CR1, and CXCL12/CXCR4 and adopt an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype, facilitating immune escape and angiogenesis. Key signaling pathways, including CSF1R, STAT3, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and HIF-1α, regulate TAM function, making them promising therapeutic targets. Strategies such as TAM depletion, reprogramming, and immune checkpoint blockade (PD-1/PD-L1, and CD47-SIRPα) have shown potential in preclinical models. Emerging approaches, including CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy, nanotechnology-based drug delivery, and exosome-mediated modulation, offer new avenues for intervention. However, clinical translation remains challenging due to GBM’s heterogeneity and adaptive resistance mechanisms. Future research should integrate multi-omics profiling and AI-driven drug discovery to refine TAM-targeted therapies and improve patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of TAM-mediated immune regulation in GBM and explores evolving therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming its treatment barriers.">

        <tr id="Background and purpose The tumor microenvironment (TME) is widely acknowledged as a pivotal regulator of cancer progression. However, the dualistic role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which serve as critical immune hubs within the TME, remains incompletely characterized, particularly with respect to their context-dependent capacity to either inhibit or facilitate tumor development. This review aims to synthesize current understanding of the complex interactions between stromal cells and TLSs, addressing existing gaps in mechanistic insight and exploring therapeutic avenues to exploit TLS plasticity. Key reviewed topics The current study critically reviews the mechanisms by which stromal components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells, contribute to TLS neogenesis through chemokine-mediated recruitment of lymphocytes. Furthermore, it highlights the dual functional roles of TLSs as sites of both anti-tumor immune activation and immunosuppression, notably via the enrichment of regulatory T cells. The clinical implications of mature TLS presence, particularly their association with improved patient prognosis and enhanced therapeutic responsiveness, are also analyzed. Main conclusions TLSs demonstrate a bifunctional nature, wherein their spatial organization and dynamic interactions with stromal elements dictate the balance between immune activation and tolerance within the TME. While mature TLSs are generally correlated with favorable clinical outcomes, their potential to foster immunosuppressive microenvironments necessitates the development of precision-targeted interventions. The interplay between stromal cells and TLSs represents a promising therapeutic axis for modulating the tumor immune milieu. Future perspectives Future research should prioritize strategies aimed at promoting TLS maturation, disrupting immunosuppressive niches, and integrating TLS-modulating agents with existing immunotherapeutic regimens to enhance clinical efficacy. Additionally, the identification of robust biomarkers reflective of TLS functional states and the rigorous validation of stromal-targeted therapies within combinatorial treatment frameworks are imperative for advancing translational applications.

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It follows a dynamic course in which early hyperinflammation coexists and overlaps with progressive immune suppression, a process best described as immunodynamic disruption. Key mechanisms include extensive lymphocyte death, expansion of regulatory T cells, impaired antigen presentation, and persistent activation of inhibitory checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These changes reduce immune competence and increase vulnerability to secondary infections. Clinically, reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen–DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes and persistent lymphopenia have emerged as robust biomarkers for patient stratification and timing of immunomodulatory therapies. Beyond the acute phase, many survivors do not achieve full immune recovery but instead develop a Persistent Immune Remnant, defined as long-lasting immune, metabolic, and endothelial dysfunction despite apparent clinical resolution. Recognizing PIR emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring and biomarker-guided interventions to restore immune balance. To integrate these observations, we propose the SIMMP–Sepsis model (Sepsis-Associated Persistent Multiorgan Immunometabolic Syndrome), which links molecular dysfunction to clinical trajectories and provides a framework for developing precision immunotherapies. This perspective reframes sepsis not only as an acute crisis but also as a chronic immunometabolic syndrome, where survival marks the beginning of active immune restoration.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) proliferation is significantly influenced by the interactions between leukemia blasts and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Specifically, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) derived from AML patients (AML-MSCs) are known to support leukemia growth and facilitate disease progression. Studies have demonstrated that the transfer of mitochondria from MSCs to AML blasts not only aids in disease progression but also contributes to chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, BM stromal cells can trigger a metabolic shift in malignant cells from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, which enhances both growth and chemo-resistance. This study focuses on identifying transcriptional and metabolic alterations in AML-MSCs to uncover potential targeted therapies for AML. We employed RNA sequencing and microarray analysis on MSCs cocultured with leukemic cells (MLL-AF9) and on MSCs isolated from both non-leukemic and MLL-AF9 leukemic mice. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated a significant downregulation of gene sets associated with oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AML-MSCs. Furthermore, coculture of MSCs from wild-type mice (WT-MSCs) and a healthy donor individual (HD-MSCs) with AML cells demonstrated reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. These metabolic changes were consistent in AML-MSCs derived from both leukemic mice and patients. Our results indicate that AML cells diminish the metabolic capacity of MSCs, specifically targeting oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. These findings suggest potential metabolic vulnerabilities that could be exploited to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for AML.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and stromal cells that form at sites of inflammation, providing adaptive immune responses outside of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). Found in various pathological conditions—including chronic infections, cancer, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and allergy—the presence of TLSs is linked to potentiation of local immunity. TLSs can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on context, and have been implicated as prognostic for disease severity and therapy response. Architecturally, TLSs resemble SLOs with distinct T and B cell areas supported by fibroblasts that secrete chemokines and cytokines that support immune cells. These structures must be created de novo in non‐lymphoid tissues; thus, the steps for TLS formation mimic, but do not completely copy, those of SLO formation. The accumulation of immune cells in tissues in inflammatory settings can initiate remodeling of tissue fibroblasts, leading to TLS formation; this process is common across tissues, although there are tissue‐ and disease‐specific pathways that impact TLS formation in certain contexts.

        <tr id="The cytokines interleukin (IL)-22 and IL-17 are secreted by innate and adaptive immune cells to drive “type III” responses that protect against extracellular pathogens, promote mucosal barrier integrity, and foster microbiota homeostasis. However, dysregulation of IL-22 and/or IL-17 contributes to autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, and malignancy. Thus, a deeper understanding of mechanisms regulating type III cytokine production could provide new therapeutic targets for a spectrum of immune-mediated diseases. Toward this goal, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen to identify factors that regulate IL-22/IL-17 expression in a murine type III innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) model, MNK3, following stimulation with IL-23 and IL-1b. In addition to previously known regulators of type III cytokines, including IL-23 receptor components IL23R and IL12RB1, the screen identified a large set of new factors that either potentiate or attenuate expression of IL-22 and/or IL-17. A subset of these novel factors was chosen for validation, from which two were selected for further study. The nuclear protein, SON, which binds both DNA and RNA, impaired expression of IL12RB1 at the levels of de novo transcription and RNA processing. The second, MAP4K1 (HPK1), is a serine/threonine kinase that is required for IL-22 but not IL-17 expression. Depletion of MAP4K1 in MNK3 also enhanced expression of the type I cytokine, IFNg, which was co-expressed with IL-17, a phenotype reminiscent of pathogenic Th17 cells. Together, results from the CRISPRi screen broaden our understanding of the factors involved in type III immune responses and offer new targets for modulating IL-22/17 expression.">

 Radiation therapy (RT) can trigger type I interferon (IFN-I) responses and anti-tumor immunity in various can- cers. However, glioblastoma inevitably recurs, suggesting RT does not generate a long-lasting immune response. This may be due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and/or RT-induced immune evasion. Our ﬁndings show that RT promotes fatty acid synthase (FASN)-mediated lipid synthesis, a metabolic program that reportedly suppresses IFN-I in viral immunity. We hypothesized that FASN induction similarly inhibits IFN-I in irradiated glioblastoma, limiting antitumor immunity. We aim to determine whether FASN blockade restores IFN-I signaling, enhances immune inﬁltration, and improves RT and immunotherapy eﬃcacy.



 Murine glioblastoma cells were subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FASN knockout or treated with FASN in- hibitors (FASNi), then irradiated (6Gy) and analyzed 24h post-RT using RNA sequencing, LEGENDplex, and ELISA. In vivo, glioblastoma-bearing mice received FASNi (days 9-30), anti-PD-1 (twice weekly, days 15-24), and fractionated RT (5×6Gy, days 10-14). Survival was monitored (n=7/group), and tumor immune inﬁltration was assessed at day 20 using ﬂow cytometry and multiplex imaging. Long-term survivors (>100 days) were rechal- lenged in the contralateral hemisphere. In some experiments, mice received anti-CD8 or anti-IFNAR antibodies.



 Transcriptome analysis identiﬁed IFN-I signaling as the most enriched pathway in irradiated FASN-knockout cells, conﬁrmed by increased IFN-I protein levels. In vivo, RT+FASNi inﬂamed glioblastoma tumors, enhancing CD11c and CD8 T-cell inﬁltration. Remarkably, adding anti-PD-1 to RT+FASNi further improved survival, with 86% of mice tumor-free at 100 days vs. 43% in other RT-treated groups. Rechallenged RT+FASNi+anti-PD-1 survivors did not develop a tumor when compared to naïve animals, demonstrating immunological memory. CD8 depletion or IFNAR blockade abrogated this effect, highlighting the critical role of IFN-I and CD8



 FASN inhibition restores IFN-I responses in irradiated glioblastoma, enhancing immune inﬁltration and im- munotherapy eﬃcacy. These ﬁndings highlight FASN as a key target to shift glioblastoma from immunosup- pressive to immunoresponsive.

        <tr id="Abstract The obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect a third of the world’s population. Toxoplasmosis is considered a significant worldwide disease that can lead to morbidity or death in immunocompromised individuals. Host defense against T. gondii has been demonstrated to be dependent on a rapid myeloid cell and lymphocyte response working in concert to quickly eliminate the invading pathogen. Classically, T-bet–dependent group 1 innate lymphocytes (ILC1s), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ T cell–derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are considered indispensable for host resistance against T. gondii. However, recent discoveries have illustrated that T-bet is not required for NK cell– or CD4+ T cell–derived IFN-γ. Yet, lack of T-bet still results in rapid mortality, pointing to a T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–mediated host defense pathway. This review summarizes the myeloid cell–mediated immune response against T. gondii and provides insights into the lesser known components of the T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–dependent host defense pathway for pathogen clearance.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils have long been regarded as cells of a limited lifespan, known to produce pro-inflammatory molecules, and primarily engaged in combating infections. However, recent advancements in single-cell analysis and molecular biology have revealed their remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity, particularly within the context of tumors. This review explores the development and diversity of neutrophils under both physiological and pathological conditions, with a particular focus on their roles in cancer. The discussion encompasses the emergence of distinct neutrophil subtypes, particularly senescent neutrophils, within tumors and their context-dependent functions in tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, and recurrence. The plasticity of these cells, driven by intrinsic factors and the tumor microenvironment, allows them to be reprogrammed between pro-tumor and anti-tumor phenotypes. This process is influenced by cytokines, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with other immune cells. The potential of targeting and engineering neutrophil as a therapeutic avenue for cancer treatment is further underscored, including the use of senolytic agents, metabolic inhibitors, and reprogramming strategies. Finally, future research directions are proposed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying neutrophil heterogeneity and plasticity, with the aim of developing novel therapeutic approaches to modulate neutrophil function in cancer.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer, with poor survival rates in advanced stages due to late diagnosis, tumor heterogeneity, and therapy resistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in HCC has a crucial role in tumor progression, characterized by a complex interaction of immune cells, stromal components, and immunosuppressive signaling pathways. Chronic inflammation driven by viral infections, metabolic dysfunction, and alcohol consumption triggers an immunosuppressive TME, promoting immune evasion and tumor growth. Immune cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, contribute to immunosuppression, while cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells exert anti-tumor effects. Recent advances in immunotherapy, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed death-ligand 1 and programmed cell death protein 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, have revolutionized HCC treatment, though response rates remain limited. Combined therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and ICIs improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the immunological mechanisms contributing to HCC progression, the role of immune cell subsets in tumor evasion, and therapeutic interventions, from conventional treatments to advanced immunotherapies. Ongoing clinical trials, barriers to effective treatment, and future directions to enhance HCC management and patient survival will also be overviewed.">

        <tr id="Abstract The effectiveness of T cell–based immunotherapy depends on durable T-cell responses that can efficiently eliminate tumor cells. NKG7 was discovered three decades ago as a protein associated with lytic granules. However, only studies published over the past 5 years have contributed substantially to our understanding of NKG7 in T-cell biology. NKG7 has been recognized as an important T-cell functional marker in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and in the prognosis of certain cancers. Besides its role in the generation, trafficking, and release of lytic granules, which is critical for efficient T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells, NKG7 has been identified as a key negative regulator of mTORC1 activity. By restraining mTORC1 activity, NKG7 promotes T-cell longevity and memory generation after infection. Importantly, NKG7 upregulation has demonstrated therapeutic potential in preclinical T-cell therapy for cancer. Collectively, NKG7 is emerging as a promising biomarker and therapeutic addition to T cell–based immunotherapies.">

Humanized mice with a human immune system have advanced understanding of human immunity, yet suboptimal myelopoiesis and lack of functional neutrophils remain challenges. We developed MaGIC mice, a model expressing human CD47, M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and thrombopoietin while reducing murine CD47 on the C57Bl/6 N background. MaGIC mice support robust human hematopoiesis, including functional neutrophils, monocytes, and tissue macrophages. These neutrophils, phenotypically and developmentally comparable to human neutrophils, exhibit chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in response to inflammatory stimuli, providing an innovative platform to study human neutrophils in infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.">

As cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the primary focus has been on the cytotoxic capabilities and antigen specificity of these subsets. A recently identified subset, Granzyme k (Gzmk)+ CD8 T cells, has been closely associated with inflammatory diseases, independent of their cytotoxic function. Unlike other granzymes, granzyme K predominantly induces proinflammatory responses in tissues or cells rather than mediating cytotoxicity.

        <tr id="Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-MPNs) are clonal hematologic malignancies characterized not only by driver mutations such as JAK2V617F, CALR, and MPL but also by a profoundly dysregulated immune microenvironment. Chronic inflammation and immune remodeling sustain malignant hematopoiesis and contribute to disease progression from essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) to overt myelofibrosis (MF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines—including IL-2, IFN-α, IL-23, and TNF-α—drive abnormal T cell polarization, favoring a pathogenic Th17 phenotype. Lymphocyte subset analysis reveals a predominance of exhausted PD-1+ T cells, reflecting impaired immune surveillance. Concurrently, alterations in neutrophil apoptosis lead to persistent inflammation and stromal activation. GRO-α (CXCL1) is elevated in ET but reduced in MF, suggesting a subtype-specific role in disease biology. Fibrosis-promoting factors such as TGF-β and IL-13 mediate bone marrow remodeling and megakaryocyte expansion, while VEGF and other angiogenic factors enhance vascular niche alterations, particularly in PV. These immunopathologic features underscore novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. In addition to JAK inhibition, targeted strategies such as CXCR1/2 antagonists, anti-TGF-β agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) may offer disease-modifying potential. Understanding the interplay between cytokine signaling and immune cell dysfunction is crucial for developing precision immunotherapies in MPNs.">

        <tr id="Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with chronic liver inflammation being a major risk factor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with improved survival and better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in several cancers. However, their role in HCC remains unclear, and findings are often contradictory. Methods: The study investigated the presence and composition of TLSs across multiple liver disease models, including livers containing HCC. TLSs were characterized to identify the essential cellular components for functional lymphoid activity. The functional role of age-associated B cells (ABCs) was further explored by blocking T-bet expression in B cells, thereby preventing their differentiation into ABCs. Results: TLS frequency was increased in livers containing HCC. Characterization confirmed the presence of key immune cell subsets supporting lymphoid function. Blocking T-bet in B cells led to a reduction in ABCs, which resulted in smaller TLS, a specific decrease in hepatic B cells, and reduced tumor lesion size in HCC-bearing mice. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ABCs promote TLS formation and growth, facilitating B-cell recruitment to the liver and supporting HCC progression. Targeting T-bet–dependent ABC differentiation may represent a novel strategy to limit TLS formation and slow HCC progression.">

Here, we describe the preclinical efficacy and safety of the bispecific CD123/CD16A innate cell engager “AFM28”, demonstrating superior activity against AML and MDS patient-derived LSPCs and blasts in vitro compared to an Fc-enhanced CD123-targeting antibody, especially towards CD123low and/or CD64+ leukemic cells. AFM28 induces autologous anti-leukemic activity in fresh AML whole blood cultures, demonstrating its potential to enhance NK cell function from AML patients. Responsiveness can be further enhanced by allogeneic NK cell addition. Anti-leukemic activity of AFM28 is confirmed in xenograft mouse models. In addition, AFM28 is well tolerated and demonstrates pharmacodynamic activity in cynomolgus monkeys. Altogether, our results indicate that AFM28 has the potential to reduce relapse-inducing residual disease and promote long-term remissions for patients with AML and MDS with a favorable safety profile.">

Importantly, we elucidate significant gaps in the understanding of the complex role for NK cells in skin homeostasis and pathology, and posit unique opportunities the accessibility of this secondary lymphoid organ provides for translational studies to improve our understanding of cutaneous immunity.">

        <tr id="Abstract This study investigates the impact of the CD2–CD58 signaling axis on effector T cell function and tumor metabolic crosstalk in breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) using single‐cell transcriptomic analysis. scRNA‐seq data analysis revealed the critical role of CD2–CD58 signaling between CD8+ T cells and tumor cells in BCBM. Functional assays demonstrated that CD2 knockdown inhibited cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity, leading to impaired tumor cell recognition and enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo studies showed that CD2‐deficient CTLs promoted tumor growth and brain metastasis while affecting metabolic reprogramming by altering key enzyme expressions in pyrimidine biosynthesis and arginine metabolism pathways. The findings suggest that CD2 enhances CTL function against tumor cells and influences their metabolic states, highlighting the role of CD2 in remodeling the brain metastatic microenvironment in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Sepsis represents a dynamic, dysregulated host immune response to infection in which unconventional T cells—γδ T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and double-negative T cells—actively shape the balance between early hyperinflammation and subsequent immune paralysis across time and tissues. These cells employ unique antigen recognition mechanisms to trigger rapid immune responses. γδ T cells facilitate early pathogen elimination and immune regulation, whereas MAIT cells detect microbial metabolites and modulate the systemic inflammation. NKT cells balance immune homeostasis through dual pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This review classifies these subsets and examines their sepsis-related functions alongside immunotherapies targeting them, such as cytokine manipulation, immunomodulators, and checkpoint inhibitors. Elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying sepsis could advance therapies that restore immune equilibrium and potentially improve clinical outcomes. Future studies should unravel the interactions between unconventional T cells and broader immune networks while translating the findings into practical treatments. Understanding the dynamic roles of these cells provides pathways for tailored interventions in sepsis management.">

        <tr id="Tumor immune evasion and incomplete responses to immunotherapy are some of the most significant obstacles in current cancer treatment. Since tumor-draining LNs (tdLNs) are cradles for anti-tumor immunity, and tumor-specific memory cells in tdLNs are the bona fide responders to immune-checkpoint blockade, tdLNs are increasingly valued in oncoimmunology research and cancer treatments. Recent progress has revealed that lymph nodes (LNs) are innervated and regulated by sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers. Because tumor cells, nerves, and immune cells coexist inside tdLNs—sites where anti-tumor immunity is initiated and compromised—it is critical to investigate whether tumor-neuro-immune crosstalk also occurs in these nodes. Although direct evidence in tdLNs is lacking, we synthesize emerging evidence supporting this possibility. We argue that validating this hypothesis will be essential for elucidating immune evasion mechanisms and advancing surgical and immunological strategies against tumors. In this review, we first introduce LN anatomy, highlighting its innervation by sensory and sympathetic fibers. We then examine the neural regulation of immune activities, especially those within LNs and those associated with a tumor context. We further discuss the multifaceted roles of tdLNs in tumor immunology, including orchestration of anti-tumor immunity and local immunosuppression, pre-metastatic LN remodeling, and induction of systemic tumor-specific immune tolerance. Furthermore, we look into tumor-neural interactions from two angles: tumor-induced nerve growth and activation, and neural regulation of tumor progression. Finally, we propose potential tumor-neuro-immune interactions in tdLNs, discuss current perspectives on LN handling in cancer therapy, and discuss clinical implications of the progress summarized in this review.">

        <tr id="Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) presents significant challenges for the treatment of this disease. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most successful strategies in cancer treatment, especially for advanced HCC. Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors have moderate efficacy as monotherapies for HCC. Tumor angiogenesis, a crucial factor in tumor growth and proliferation, plays a pivotal role in the immune regulation of HCC. The vascular and immune microenvironments of solid tumors engage in dynamic reciprocal crosstalk, forming a complex vascular–immune axis that critically shapes antitumor immune responses and drives therapy resistance. The high degree of angiogenesis observed in HCC leads to abnormal vascular structure and function, which not only promotes tumor growth but also induces hypoxia and acidosis within the TME, thereby suppressing the immune response through various mechanisms. Given the regulatory role of tumor blood vessels in the immune system, the integration of antiangiogenic therapy into current immunotherapy approaches provides a novel treatment option. This integration involves the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, improvements in the TME, and enhancements of the immune response, among other mechanisms. This review summarizes the angiogenic mechanisms of HCC, the clinical applications of immunotherapy and the regulatory effects of angiogenesis on the immune response in HCC.">

 Adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies have shown limited efficacy against most solid tumors. A key barrier to success is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Beyond local effects, tumors induce systemic immune disturbances that further hinder anti-tumor immunity and promote disease progression. In this study, we investigate how tumor-driven systemic immunosuppression compromises the function of both endogenous and adoptively transferred natural killer (NK) cells, identifying potential strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes.



 We utilized syngeneic murine cancer models to systematically characterize alterations in immune cell populations within the circulation and spleen. Comprehensive and in-depth assessment of immune cell function, transcriptional activity, and metabolic state was performed using flow cytometry, Seahorse metabolic analysis, RNA sequencing, metabolic tracing, and ex vivo co-culture systems.



 In our PDAC mouse models, tumor burden elicited a robust systemic inflammatory response marked by expansion of myeloid lineage cells, particularly MDSCs, within the TME, peripheral blood, and spleen. Tumor growth led to reduced frequencies and functional deficits in both endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in circulation and spleen. Depletion of Gr-1+ MDSCs effectively restored NK cell effector functions. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice promote NK cell dysfunction through induction of lipid peroxidation. Notably, we observed pronounced upregulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—a central lipid metabolism regulator—in MDSCs, which drove increased lipid oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Disruption of the ApoE-LDL receptor (LDLR) axis in MDSCs, achieved via genetic ablation, reprogrammed their metabolic activities and significantly reduced their immunosuppressive capacity toward both endogenous and transferred NK cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of lipid utilization rescued NK cell function and, when combined with NK cell adoptive transfer, produced synergistic anti-tumor effects in PDAC models.



 Our results emphasize the pivotal role of MDSC expansion in mediating systemic immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts. We identify the ApoE/LDLR axis as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt MDSC-driven immunosuppression, thereby enhancing the efficacy of NK cell–based immunotherapies. These findings underscore the importance of resolving systemic immune dysregulation in cancer patients to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy.

This review comprehensively examines the immunosuppressive TME of RCC, emphasizing the roles of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive immune cells, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), abnormal vasculature, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in fostering immune evasion. This review summarized emerging biomarkers—including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene mutations, and immune-based subtypes—that may predict ICI response. Furthermore, we evaluate current immunotherapeutic strategies, such as ICIs, combination therapies, and novel approaches targeting immunosuppressive cells and metabolic pathways. While combination therapies have improved outcomes, challenges like toxicity and resistance persist, necessitating biomarker-driven patient stratification and optimized treatment sequencing. Future directions should focus on deciphering TME heterogeneity and developing precision immunotherapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy in RCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells represent a unique population of innate-like T lymphocytes capable of detecting non-peptide antigens in the context of monomorphic antigen-presenting molecules. Due to their abundance in barrier tissues, reactivity to local inflammatory cues, and cytotoxic and regulatory functions, MAIT cells are poised to shape the dynamics of various tumor microenvironments. Growing evidence suggests that MAIT cells can exert protumor and/or antitumor effects in cancers arising from or metastasizing to mucosal tissues. However, MAIT cell roles in bladder cancer (BCa) remains unclear. Methods To begin to identify MAIT cells in BCa, we stained bladder tumor biopsies for T cell receptor (TCR) Vα7.2+ cells. We then refined a human MAIT cell signature, which enabled us to interrogate a bulk RNA sequencing dataset and conduct correlation analyses linking intratumoral MAIT cell abundance and mortality from BCa. To extend our work to an in vivo setting, we employed a clinically relevant mouse model in which Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-sufficient) and Mr1−/− B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-deficient) mice were exposed to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine, a chemical carcinogen associated with tobacco smoke. In additional experiments, MAIT cells were functionally removed through acetyl-6-formylpterin (Ac-6-FP) administration. Effector and regulatory cell types were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and BCa tumor burden and progression were assessed by MRI and/or H&E and Ki67 staining. Results TCR Vα7.2+ cells were readily detectable in several BCa biopsies, and our bioinformatic analyses correlated heavier MAIT cell presence in BCa tumors with poorer overall survival. Similarly, we found higher tumor burdens in Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST mice than in Mr1−/− or Ac-6-FP-treated animals. Bladder MAIT cells from tumor-bearing mice exhibited phenotypic MAIT17 bias based on transcription factors they harbored along with increased interleukin-17A and tumor necrosis factor-α production capacities upon stimulation. Finally, FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cell frequencies were elevated in Mr1+/+ mouse bladder tumors, likely contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, a finding that could be recapitulated in our transcriptomic studies on human BCa. Conclusions MAIT cells are abundant in BCa tumor microenvironments where they potentiate Treg cell accumulation and play protumor roles.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Obesity is a rapidly growing public health crisis associated simultaneously with increased metabolic disease and humoral immune suppression to vaccination or infection. Inflammatory CD11c+T-bet+ B cells (ABCs) increase in spleen and adipose tissue during obesity and exacerbate metabolic dysfunction via antibodies. We now find that during obesity Tbet+ B cells also expand in the liver but not omentum or mesenteric fat. Obese mice also develop increased splenic CXCR5+ TFH and hepatic CXCR5− TPH cells which serve as likely partners for antigen-experienced MHC-II+ ABCs. We also observed that antibodies in obese mice, previously found to contribute to metabolic disease, largely circulate as inflammatory autoantigen-bound immune complexes. Perhaps most striking was our observation that obese mice lacking T-bet in B cells develop increased autoantibody titers and expanded splenic germinal center (GC) B and T helper cells. T-bet+ B cell-deficient mice make a similarly enhanced GC, TFH, TPH response to haptenated-protein vaccination with a corresponding increase in antibody affinity, although there is no additive effect of obesity. These results are consistent with GC inhibition by expanded ABCs demonstrated by others to occur during autoimmunity, suggesting a broadly universal mechanism which may also explain reduced humoral immunity and poor clinical outcomes following infection in patients with obesity and other forms of chronic inflammation.">

        <tr id="Success of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) is intricately influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex ecosystem that encompasses immune cells, stromal elements, and extracellular components. Despite the clinical breakthroughs of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, and other immunotherapeutic interventions, many patients fail to respond and eventually die. Emerging evidence points to cancer stem cells (CSCs) as critical drivers of immune evasion, therapy-resistance, and tumor relapse. CSCs modulate the TME by secreting immune-suppressive factors, recruiting regulatory immune cells, and inducing phenotype-switching of anti-tumor TME subsets, thereby creating a protective niche that hinders immune surveillance. Conversely, the TME protects CSCs through hypoxia, altered metabolism, and immuno-suppressive cell populations. This bi-directional crosstalk supports tumor progression and provides resistance to immunotherapeutic strategies mainly by: (i) escaping immune-recognition and inhibiting active T cells via high immune-checkpoint molecule expression, (ii) creating immunosuppressive pro-tumor environment, and (iii) evading immune-mediated apoptosis of CSCs along with therapy-induced enrichment of their pool. Targeting CSCs in concert with reprogramming the TME via CSC-directed agents, metabolic modulators, or combinatorial immunotherapies, therefore, offers a promising avenue to overcome immunotherapy-resistance and achieve durable clinical responses. This review discusses the deeper mechanistic understanding of CSC-TME interactions, in light of designing next-generation immunotherapies with broader efficacy across diverse tumor types.">

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects nearly one-fourth of the global population, yet effective diagnostics and treatments remain limited. Systemic immune dysregulation plays a key role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the value of immune profiling.


METHODS

PBMCs were stained with a 29-marker panel to identify 15 immune cell types and assess cytokine expression.


RESULTS
MASLD patients showed increased CD8⁺ T cells, early NK cells, and monocytes, along with reductions in TH2, TH1, late NK, and Treg cells. Cytokine profiling revealed elevated IL-6 expression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and late NK cells, indicating systemic inflammation. Automated clustering (PhenoGraph, UMAP) identified NK and phagocytic subsets associated with disease and treatment. Notably, 11β-HSD1 inhibition led to downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-6) and partial restoration of immune subsets.


CONCLUSIONS
These results offer a high-resolution view of immune alterations in MASLD and suggest that 11β-HSD1 inhibition may represent a promising immunomodulatory therapeutic strategy.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer is a complex ecosystem, in which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as the most abundant stromal cell type, meticulously construct an ecological niche that supports tumor growth through mechanisms including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, secretion of bioactive factors, and interactions with neighboring cells. High-resolution technologies, including single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have revealed the high heterogeneity, functional diversity, and spatial distribution within the CAF population. Significant differences exist in the interactions between distinct CAF subpopulations and immune cells. Through complex crosstalk with the immune system, they collaboratively establish an immunosuppressive network, becoming a core driving force for tumor immune escape. This review focuses on the latest research advances in heterogeneous subpopulations of CAFs within the breast cancer microenvironment, delves into how the complex bidirectional crosstalk between different CAF subpopulations and immune cells collaboratively shapes the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and summarizes various CAF-based therapeutic strategies for breast cancer, aiming to provide critical theoretical basis and novel therapeutic perspectives for the clinical translation of CAF heterogeneity research.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The crossing of the endothelial basement membranes (BMs) is a limiting step for leukocyte diapedesis. Heterotrimeric laminins (LMs) containing α4- and α5-chains are major BM components with opposite effects on transendothelial migration. Here, we examined whether LMα4 levels influence intratumor accumulation of specific immune cells and their impact on prognosis of early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). Using two independent patient cohorts, we found that LMα4 expression positively correlated with intratumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells and macrophages, but not with regulatory T (Treg) cells. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified CD8+ T cell density as the strongest independent prognostic factor associated with reduced tumor relapse in both cohorts. While intratumor macrophage and Treg cell densities alone were not independently associated with prognosis, their abundance modulated outcomes specifically in tumors with high CD8+ T cell infiltration, with macrophage-rich tumors showing improved outcomes and Treg cell-enriched tumors exhibiting worse prognosis. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) COAD cohort confirmed the positive correlation of LMα4 expression with both CD8+ T cell and macrophage infiltration, an association that was independent of the CRC clinical stage. Our findings suggest a subtype-specific effect for LMα4 in intratumor leukocyte infiltration, and underscore the prognostic interactions among CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and macrophages in early-stage colorectal cancer.">

 Fractionated focal radiation therapy (RT) induces immunogenic cell death and activates the type I interferon pathway via the cGAS/STING pathway, promoting tumor antigen cross-presentation by conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and driving tumor-specific T-cell activation. However, the impact of RT on tumor regression is often limited by its complex effects on the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME). Several studies have shown that RT increases both the frequency and functional activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), due in part to their intrinsic radioresistance and to RT-induced modulation of recruitment signals such as TGFβ, CCL17, and CCL221-2. In a recent study, we showed that RT combined with immunotherapy can remodel the TiME3, et persistent infiltration of activated Tregs can dampen the full immunostimulatory effects of RT-driven viral mimicry responses4. Here, we evaluated whether combining RT with blockade of the myeloid checkpoint SIRPα could modulate Treg infiltration and activity. Using mouse models of luminal (TSA) and triple-negative (AT3) breast cancer, we tested RT in combination with a blocking anti-SIRPα antibody (MY1; SIRPα-b). While MY1 monotherapy showed minimal activity, its combination with RT led to enhanced regression of irradiated tumors and inhibition of non-irradiated (abscopal) tumor growth in both tumor models. This effect was lost upon conditional cDC depletion using Zbtb46-DTR mice, highlighting the importance of cDCs in mediating the therapeutic synergy. To dissect the immune mechanisms underlying this synergy, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and CITE-seq on CD45+ tumor-infiltrating cells from TSA tumors treated with RT ± SIRPα-b. We observed a significant reduction in Treg infiltration in SIRPα-b–treated tumors, with or without RT. Furthermore, expression of Treg activation markers OX40, CTLA-4, and GITR was reduced, particularly in the RT + SIRPα-b group. Among infiltrating CD45+ cells, expression of Treg recruiting Ccl22 and Ccl17 chemokines was observed only in a highly activated cluster of CCR7high cDCs expressing SIRPα, CXCL16, PD-L1, and IL-15Rα. Notably, expression of both chemokines was strongly decreased following SIRPα-b treatment, suggesting that SIRPα signaling supports Treg recruitment via this cDC population.Studies to understand the mechanisms of Treg recruitment to the tumor via chemokine secretion by CCR7high cDCs and their role in tumor regression after RT + SIRPα-b are underway. Intra-tumoral CCR7high cDCs are known to support the activation and cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in the tumor through transpresentation of Il-155. Our results suggest that this population also plays a key immunoregulatory role in shaping the TiME. Targeting the CD47/SIRPα axis may thus improve RT efficacy by modulating the dual functions of CCR7high cDCs in both effector stimulation and Treg recruitment.

        <tr id="Sjögren’s disease (SjD) targets the salivary and lacrimal glands and is characterized by autoantibody production and glandular lymphocytic infiltrate with ectopic germinal centers (EGCs). The chemokine CCL25 recruits CCR9+ CD4+ T cells to the salivary glands to promote B cell activation. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting the CCL25–CCR9 axis to limit glandular inflammation and lymphoid neogenesis remains largely unexplored. Evaluate whether blocking the CCL25–CCR9+ T cell axis with a monoclonal antibody could reduce immune infiltration, ectopic germinal center (EGC) formation, and local autoantibody production in the NOD.H2(h4) mouse model of SjD. Female NOD.H2(h4) mice were administered anti-CCL25 antibody, isotype control, or PBS intraperitoneally for 12 weeks. Sera and saliva were collected to evaluate anti-Ro52 antibodies via ELISA across treatment groups. Salivary glands were harvested and processed for H&E staining to assess lymphocytic infiltration and focus scores. Treatment with α-CCL25 was well tolerated, with no significant differences in body weight or stimulated salivary flow between treatment groups. Histopathological evaluation revealed no reduction in lymphocytic infiltration, focus scores, or percentage of inflamed tissue in α-CCL25-treated mice compared to controls. Anti-Ro52 antibodies were undetectable in plasma or saliva across all groups and timepoints. Systemic CCL25 blockade did not significantly alter salivary gland inflammation, function, or autoantibody production in NOD.H2(h4) mice. These findings suggest that monotherapy targeting the CCL25–CCR9 axis may be insufficient to resolve glandular autoimmunity in this model and that additional or combinatorial strategies may be necessary for effective intervention.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal yet paradoxical roles of innate immune cells and their associated cytokines in orchestrating the dynamic landscape of the breast tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Innate immune effectors, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and natural killer (NK) cells, exert dual functions by either initiating robust antitumor responses or facilitating immune evasion, metastatic dissemination, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, MDSCs suppress T and NK cell activity via STAT3/NF-κB signaling and modulate the cytokine milieu through IL-10 and TGF-β. Similarly, M2-polarized TAMs promote angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance via IL-10/STAT3/Bcl-2 pathways. In contrast, NK cells and CD103+ DCs mediate tumor cell cytolysis and prime antigen-specific immunity, though their activity is frequently compromised in advanced disease. Moreover, key cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β, and CCL2/5, demonstrate subtype-specific and context-dependent effects, acting as both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing agents through complex signaling networks. This review highlights the dualistic nature of innate immune components in breast cancer, discusses their prognostic and therapeutic implications, and proposes novel intervention strategies, such as TAM repolarization, and cytokine modulation, to reprogram the TIME and restore effective immune surveillance, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer.">

Additionally, by reshaping the immune landscape, intratumoral microbiota can dysregulate immune checkpoint expression, ultimately affecting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the origins of intratumoral microbiota, their heterogeneity across cancer types, and their intricate roles in modulating immune responses and tumor metastasis. We further discuss innovative therapeutic strategies leveraging the intratumoral microbiota, including engineered bacteria, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles, and address existing challenges and potential future research directions.

In the presented study, RNA-seq and clinical data of LUAD patients were downloaded from TCGA; screening for genes associated with disulfidptosis and immune infiltration, revealed that fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) modulates immune infiltration via disulfidptosis regulation. We also in-vitro experiments identified FGA suppression abrogates disulfidptosis through SLC7A11/xCT downregulation and attenuated disulfidptosis while concurrently enhancing malignant phenotypes, including cellular proliferation, migratory capacity, and invasive potential in LUAD models.

By integrating data on tumor suppressors, oncogenic factors, cytokines, and chemokines, we performed differential gene expression analyses across immune populations.This analysis identified nine major immune cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer/T cells (NK/T cells), B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and macrophages. Notably, elevated CCR7 expression in exhausted CD8+ T cells was associated with improved prognosis, suggesting it as a preliminary candidate for an immunoregulatory target that warrants further investigation. Additionally, CCL5 levels were elevated in Tregs, indicating a possible involvement in their recruitment to the tumor site that requires further validation. Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis identified candidate genes for further mechanistic investigation.This systematic comparison of the TME between tumor and paratumor tissues reveals dynamic changes in the immune landscape, providing insights and suggesting potential targets for further study to enhance understanding and treatment of CSCC.">

        <tr id="Introduction Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory treatment option for different T cell-mediated diseases such as cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). While in CTCL the polarization of T cells is shifted towards T helper cells type 1 (TH1) and an immune response against the lymphoma is induced, ECP in GvHD rather leads to the expansion of regulatory T cells (Treg). How ECP regulates the immune response dependent on the underlying disease is still not exactly known. As dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial regulators of the immune response, it is supposed that they are key players in the immunomodulatory effects of ECP. However, due to the scarcity of primary DCs in blood, research has focused on in vitro-generated monocyte-derived DCs so far. Methods Here, we present for the first time how the primary human blood DC subpopulations, i.e., conventional DCs type 1 (cDC1), cDC2, DC3, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), directly isolated from blood of healthy donors, respond to in vitro ECP treatment. Results We demonstrate that the exposure to 8-methoxypsoralen and UV-A light irradiation induces apoptosis in Toll-like receptor ligand-activated cDC1 and pDC as well as - to a minor extent - in steady state cDC1, cDC2, and DC3. However, the selective effect of ECP on viability of DC subpopulations was dependent on culture duration (18h vs. 42h) as well as condition (steady state vs. TLR ligand activated). Further, ECP modulates the expression of the co-stimulatory and co-regulatory molecules CD40, CD86, and PD-L1 on DC subpopulations. While ECP did not affect the T cell stimulatory capacity of cDC2 and DC3, ECP-treated cDC1 and - to a minor extent - pDC showed reduced activation of memory T cells and diminished secretion of TH1- and TH17-associated cytokines. Conclusion Thus, especially blood cDC1 are direct targets of ECP and the reduction of their T cell stimulatory capacity might contribute to the clinical efficacy observed in chronic GvHD patients.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered mesenchymal stem cells (CAR-MSCs) represent a novel and highly adaptable platform for the targeted treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. By integrating the inflammation-homing and immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with the antigen-specific recognition and activation potential of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), CAR-MSCs enable site-specific delivery of therapeutic agents directly to inflamed or diseased tissues. This dual functionality enhances therapeutic precision while minimizing off-target effects and systemic toxicity. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of CAR-MSCs in modulating pathogenic immune responses, reducing local inflammation, and promoting tissue repair in various disease models. CAR-MSCs have been engineered to recognize and interact with disease-specific antigens or inflammatory markers, allowing them to selectively suppress the activation and proliferation of autoreactive immune cells. This targeted immunosuppression offers a promising strategy for restoring immune tolerance without the risks associated with systemic immunosuppression. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in CAR-MSC design, highlight mechanisms by which CARs enhance MSC functionality, and discuss key challenges, including safety, scalability, and regulatory considerations. Collectively, these emerging approaches hold substantial promise for reshaping future therapies for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Donor lymphocyte infusion is a type of immune therapy that helps control leukemia after a stem cell transplant, but it often comes with the serious side effect of graft-versus-host disease, where the donated immune cells attack the patient’s healthy tissues. Exercise has long been known to improve cancer treatment responses and reduce side effects, but its role in this type of therapy has not been well studied. In this research, we tested whether voluntary running could influence the benefits and risks of donor lymphocyte infusion in mice. All mice received leukemia cells, and some were given immune cells from healthy donors. Half of the mice had access to a running wheel, while the others remained sedentary. We found that exercise reduced the severity of graft-versus-host disease, extended survival, and slowed tumor growth. Mice that exercised lived longer and had fewer cancer cells compared to those that did not exercise. Additional analyses suggested that exercise changed how leukemia cells used energy, which may have contributed to these benefits. These findings highlight the potential of exercise to make immune therapies for leukemia more effective and safer for patients.">

Consequently, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become the primary driver of chronic liver disease globally and is currently the most rapidly accelerating factor contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, current evidence indicates that immunotherapy, a cornerstone of HCC management, yields suboptimal results specifically in MASLD-related HCC (MASLD-HCC) cases. Various immune components constitute a special immune microenvironment in MASLD-HCC, including heterogeneous myeloid cells, lymphocytes and platelets. Furthermore, disruptions in the intestinal barrier, along with the ectopic presence of intestinal flora and metabolites, also influence the immune microenvironment in MASLD-HCC. Elucidating immune cells functions and their interplay with gut microbiota is critical to deciphering MASLD progression to carcinogenesis and immunotherapy resistance. This review synthesizes current insights into the immune microenvironment and gut microbiome in MASLD-HCC, identifies factors influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy, and summarizes potential therapeutic targets to provide detailed guidance for developing effective immunotherapy strategies for MASLD-HCC.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the most prevalent and lethal form of lung cancer worldwide. Among the diverse components of the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of NSCLC progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. TAMs, particularly those polarized toward the M2-like phenotype, facilitate tumor growth through immunosuppression, angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling. They promote immune evasion via PD-L1, IL-10, and TGF-β signaling, and confer chemoresistance through activation of the IL-6/STAT3 and P2X7/STAT6 pathways. Moreover, high infiltration of M2-TAMs and their expression of immune checkpoint ligands have been associated with poor prognosis and, paradoxically, with improved response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in certain patients. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram TAM phenotypes, inhibit their recruitment, or selectively suppress their immunosuppressive functions. However, challenges such as macrophage plasticity, lack of specific biomarkers, and potential systemic toxicity remain significant barriers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological functions, mechanistic roles, and clinical implications of TAMs in NSCLC, highlighting both their value as prognostic indicators and their potential as therapeutic targets in the era of precision oncology.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer and there is mounting evidence that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a role in the pathogenesis of haematologic malignancies as well as treatment resistance. Macrophages play a central role in anti-tumor immunity, and dysregulation of macrophage mediated phagocytosis has recently emerged as a key player in blood cancers. The integrin associated protein CD47 is expressed in a variety of cancers and interacts with its ligand, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on macrophages, resulting in down regulation of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is highly expressed in various cancers including multiple myeloma (MM). It is therefore postulated that blockade of the CD47-SIRPα immune checkpoint has the potential to ‘re-awaken’ macrophage mediated phagocytosis of MM plasma cells. In this review, we provide our perspective on the key pre-clinical data supporting the CD47-SIRPα axis as a therapeutic target in MM. We subsequently discuss the ongoing clinical trials which may provide the basis for future clinical translation of these agents. We also highlight key gaps in our knowledge of macrophage biology in MM which need to be addressed by future research. Finally, we present potential future directions for translational research and personalized application of macrophage-based immunotherapy in MM.

 Despite the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), therapeutic resistance and the unpredictable development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) remain major challenges. While the use of ICIs in combination can improve treatment efficacy, this also leads to an increase in the frequency and severity of irAEs. This has created an urgent need to enhance anti-tumor immunity without triggering immunotoxicity. However, current preclinical models are limited in their ability to model both ICI efficacy and irAE development. This is due to mouse strains commonly used for studying anti-tumor immunity, such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, being resistant to ICI-induced irAEs and failing to recapitulate the full spectrum of clinical responses seen in patients with cancer. To overcome these limitations, we generated transplantable, syngeneic tumor models with variable ICI responses using the autoimmune-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. The NOD model, which spontaneously develops multiple autoimmune diseases, exhibits a broad range of irAEs following ICI treatment with a shared etiology to clinical conditions. This approach offers insight into how genetic predisposition to autoimmunity influences both ICI response and irAE susceptibility, enabling us to explore how autoimmune-associated host-intrinsic factors uniquely alter the tumor microenvironment and contribute to ICI resistance. In ICI-resistant NOD tumors, CD8+ T cells exhibited a naïve-like phenotype, marked by elevated TCF-1 and reduced PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression, compared to ICI-sensitive tumors. Despite comparable CD8+ T cell frequency and number, these phenotypic differences led us to investigate other immune cell populations that regulate ICI response and CD8+ T cell activation. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry revealed enrichment of immunosuppressive γδ T cells in ICI-resistant tumors. These γδ T cells highly expressed the transcription factors RORγt+ and TCF1+ and lacked expression of T-bet and the mouse Vγ1 TCR chain, suggesting that distinct γδ T cell subsets may play different roles in tumor control. Functionally, antibody-mediated blockade of the γδ T cell receptor (γδTCR) significantly improved tumor control in ICI-resistant, but not ICI-sensitive, models, implicating γδ T cells in promoting tumor growth. Tumors enriched with immunosuppressive RORγt+ and TCF1+ γδ T cells also exhibited increased B cell infiltration. In B cell-deficient NOD mice, γδ T cells skewed toward T-bet and Vγ1 expression, which correlated with enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. These findings reveal a coordinated immunosuppressive network between γδ T cells and B cells that limits anti-tumor immunity. Given their roles in promoting autoimmunity, these cell types may represent therapeutic targets to boost anti-tumor immunity and overcome ICI resistance without exacerbating irAEs.

        <tr id="T lymphocyte dysfunction represents a pivotal determinant of immunosuppression in sepsis. Our previous studies demonstrated that nuclear fragile X mental retardation-interacting protein 1 (NUFIP1)-mediated ribophagy conferred cytoprotection against apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes during sepsis, thereby preserving host immunocompetence. Despite growing evidence linking PANoptosis to the pathogenesis of various diseases, the potential role of ribophagy in modulating CD4+ T lymphocytes’ PANoptosis in sepsis remains largely unclear. In the present study, we employed both lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Jurkat T cells and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis models to demonstrate marked exacerbation of CD4+ T lymphocyte PANoptosis following NUFIP1 knockdown (KD), associated with impaired immune function, as evidenced by diminished cytokine production and T cell proliferation. Tandem mass tagging (TMT) proteomic analysis identified Z-nucleic acid binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-mediated PANoptosome formation and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway as critical nodes in ribophagy-dependent cytoprotection. Mechanistically, sepsis-induced ribosome collision activated the cGAS-STING signaling axis, which in turn recruited NUFIP1 to STING protein complexes. Clinical analysis of septic patients revealed enhanced ribophagy and PANoptosis in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells, consistent with the experimental findings. These results suggest that NUFIP1-mediated ribophagy alleviates CD4+ T lymphocyte PANoptosis in sepsis via the cGAS-STING pathway, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting ribophagy and PANoptosis pathways to mitigate immune paralysis and improve the outcomes following septic insults.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY During Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, infected alveolar macrophages (AMs) initially up-regulate a NRF2 regulated cell-protective program, which is detrimental to host control and impedes AM activation, including MHC II expression. MHC II is critical for CD4+ T cell activation and host immunity during Mtb infection. We hypothesized that NRF2 regulates the MHC II pathway and AM antigen presentation to T cells. We found that NRF2 inhibits MHC II, but not MHC I, specifically in AMs, following Mtb infection in vitro and in vivo. NRF2 dampens Ciita and H2-Ab1 gene expression in uninfected AMs, and MHC II inhibition by NRF2 is retained following innate stimuli and IFNγ exposure. NRF2 expression in Mtb-infected AMs impedes their ability to activate ESAT6-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, although NRF2 expression enhances cell-protective functions, it has the unexpected consequence of limiting innate-adaptive crosstalk, which can impair CD4+ T cell activation and host immunity during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer is a significant global health issue with inflammation emerging as a critical driver of progression. The prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) is comprised of tumor cells, mesenchymal stem cells, immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, adipocytes, and the extracellular matrix. All of these TME components interact via soluble factors, such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. These interactions remodel the TME and drive inflammation and tumor progression. Prolonged inflammation leads to dysregulated activation and infiltration of immune cells in the TME. This process maintains an immunosuppressive environment and facilitates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion. Chronic inflammation causes inflammatory mediators to enter the circulation over time, as evidenced by systemic biomarkers, such as the systemic immune-inflammation index, which links inflammation to disease severity. Interactions between the prostate gland and adipose tissues further exacerbate systemic inflammation. Inflammation in the prostate gland confers resistance to therapy, primes distant metastatic niches, and promotes metastatic spread, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Therapeutic strategies, such as anti-inflammatory agents and immunotherapies, hold promise in mitigating disease burden. This review explored the immune landscape of systemic inflammation in prostate cancer, discussed the role of the immune landscape in resistance to therapy and metastasis, and offered insights into potential interventions for targeting inflammation to limit prostate cancer burden.">

The pathogenic cell type(s) responsible for the syndrome are unknown and murine models recapitulating the disease are lacking. We report that loss of Uba1 in various mouse hematopoietic cell types resulted in pleiotropic consequences and demonstrate that murine mutants with about 70% loss of Uba1 in neutrophils induced non-lethal VEXAS-like symptoms. Depletion of Uba1 in HSCs induced extensive hematopoietic cell loss while depletion of Uba1 in B or T cells, or in megakaryocytes induced corresponsive cell death but these mutants appeared normal. Depletion of Uba1 in monocytes and neutrophils failed to induce cell death and the mutants were viable. Among the tested models, only depletion of Uba1 in neutrophils induced autoinflammatory symptoms including increased counts and percentage of neutrophils, increased proinflammatory cytokines, occurrence of vacuoles in myeloid cells, splenomegaly and dermatitis. Residual Uba1 was about 30% in the mutant neutrophils, which disrupted cellular hemostasis. Finally, genetic loss of the myeloid pro-survival regulator Morrbid partially mitigated the VEXAS-like symptoms. The established VEXAS-like murine model will assist understanding and treatment of the newly identified autoinflammatory syndrome prevalent among aged men.">

        <tr id="Cell death pathways play contrasting roles in physiological processes such as responses to viral infections and vaccinations, potentially exerting either detrimental or beneficial effects. On one hand, uncontrolled cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. On the other hand, when properly regulated, these processes help establish an immunocompetent environment by activating innate immunity, which in turn stimulate antiviral immune responses. These mechanisms have emerged as promising targets for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics, immunotherapies, and vaccines. Recent advances have elucidated key aspects of cell death and DAMP pathways, highlighting their association with upstream viral sensors, their capacity to regulate immune responses, and their potential as therapeutic targets in the context of respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cell death and DAMP pathways, focusing on their roles in antiviral immunity and pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and vaccine immunogenicity.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with its progression shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic factors but also by a complex and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Within this niche, diverse immune populations—including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cell subsets (Th1, Th17, Tregs), B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—collectively regulate immune surveillance and tumor escape. While effector lymphocytes mediate antitumor responses, their function is often attenuated by TAM- and MDSC-driven immunosuppression via cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), metabolic disruption, and immune checkpoint expression. High densities of M2-polarized TAMs and MDSCs correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have improved outcomes in lung cancer, yet therapeutic efficacy remains limited by the immunosuppressive TME. This review outlines the functional roles of key immune cell subsets in lung cancer and highlights emerging strategies to reprogram the TME and enhance immunotherapeutic responsiveness.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has transformed the landscape of cancer treatment, offering hope to patients who were once considered beyond the reach of effective care. However, its success is restricted to a limited fraction of patients. This discrepancy in response is largely due to the complex and dynamic nature of the tumor immune-microenvironment. At the heart of this complexity is the concept of cancer immunoediting—a dynamic process through which the immune system both sculpts and is shaped by the tumor. This process unfolds in three key stages: Elimination, Equilibrium, and Escape, each representing a shifting balance between immune defenses and tumor adaptation. Central to this interaction are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TILs are frontline defenders in targeting tumor cells, while TAMs can either hinder or facilitate tumor growth based on their polarization. As cancer progresses, immune selection pressure induces phenotypic alterations that promote immune evasion, fostering an environment detrimental to effective immune response. This review explores the role of these immunological components in each phase of immunoediting and their impact on the efficacy or failure of immunotherapy. Gaining deeper insight into these interactions is crucial for developing advanced immunotherapies that reshape tumor microenvironment and expand the reach of immunotherapy to more patients.">

        <tr id="Pathogen-associated cancers account roughly 15–20% of all malignancies worldwide and arise from chronic infections by oncogenic viruses, bacteria and parasites. Pathogens can alter the tumor microenvironment (TME) into an immune-suppressive niche using multiple mechanisms, including immune checkpoint manipulation, chronic inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, and direct epigenetic modifications. Immune dysfunctions related to infections linked to cancers can include M2-polarized macrophages, expansion of MDSCs, exhausted T/NK cells, and tolerogenic dendritic cells, all progressing immune evasion and resistance to cancer therapy. Advances in therapeutics exist in prophylactic vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and next-generation methods such as the engineered Salmonella to deliver to hypoxic tumors and the targeting the microbiome. The advancement of pathogen-, cancer-, and patient-specific therapeutics is not without its challenges, including heterogeneity of the pathogens, absence of clinically useful biomarkers, concerns about the safety of the restoring anti-pathogen immunity and challenges of scale for manifold interventions.

        <tr id="Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal proliferative disease originating from hematopoietic stem cells. While treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) effectively eliminates the majority of leukemia cells in patients, residual leukemia cells can still be detected in those achieving deep molecular remission, ultimately leading to drug resistance or relapse. But the exact mechanism is unclear. In recent years, the immune microenvironment has been a hot research topic in hematologic malignancies. CML patients exhibit abnormalities in antitumor immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which possess immune-suppressing functions, inhibit the proliferation and activation of CD4+/CD8+ T cells, Tregs, B cells, and NK cells, and play a central role in the antitumor immune response in a wide range of cancers. Abnormalities in numbers and functions of MDSCs are exhibited in CML patients, which affect the immune status of CML patients through multiple mechanisms. This review summarizes the biological properties of MDSCs, their alterations in CML patients, their roles and specific mechanisms in the development of CML, and how these mechanisms can be leveraged to develop new therapeutic strategies, aiming to provide novel insights and approaches for the treatment of CML.">

M2-like TAMs promote immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, while M1-like TAMs enhance antitumor immunity. Combining TAM-targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors is also emerging as a potential strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.

We also summarize the current strategies targeting TAMs, such as blocking the CD47/SIRPα axis, using CD40 agonists, and PI3Kγ inhibitors, which have shown promise in preclinical studies.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

The incidence of MDS (1.51/100,000 in China, 4-5/100,000 in Europe and America) is higher than any subtype of leukemia. In recent years, the imbalance of immune regulation and tumor microenvironmental disorders have received increasing attention in the pathogenesis of MDS. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein 3 (TIM-3) is an important inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule, widely expressed in T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages and other immune cells. Numerous studies have confirmed that TIM-3 is aberrantly expressed in a variety of solid and hematologic tumors and plays an important role in regulating tumor escape and immune depletion. In this paper, we focus on reviewing the relevant studies of TIM-3 in MDS and summarize the findings of our team in this field. We also discuss the potential application of TIM-3 in the diagnosis and treatment of MDS in conjunction with the latest clinical trials. Blocking TIM-3 has both ‘tumor cell-targeted inhibition’ and ‘immune function remodeling’ dual roles in MDS disease progression, which provides new therapeutic strategies and hope for MDS patients.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T lymphocytes are central effectors of anticancer immunity. Their abundance and spatial distribution within solid tumors are strongly correlated with patient prognosis and response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Tumors have been categorized into “hot,” “excluded,” and “cold” types based on the infiltration patterns of CD8+ T cells, which reflect the underlying immune contexture and therapeutic potential. However, many tumors remain resistant to T-cell infiltration, posing a significant barrier to immunotherapy. This review systematically outlines the seven critical steps of the Cancer-Immunity Cycle that govern CD8+ T-cell infiltration: antigen release, antigen processing and presentation, T-cell priming, trafficking through the vasculature, tumor infiltration, target recognition, and cytolytic activity. At each step, tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental barriers—including low tumor mutational burden, defective antigen-presenting machinery, immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-β, IL-10), abnormal vasculature, fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix, and inhibitory cell populations (e.g., Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs)—can stall the immune response. We further discuss the roles of immune-checkpoint signaling, metabolic competition, and suppressive cell networks in shaping T-cell exhaustion and exclusion. Cutting-edge technologies—such as single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, imaging mass cytometry, and TCR repertoire profiling—have revealed spatial and functional heterogeneity within intratumoral CD8+ T cells and informed the design of rational combination therapies. Understanding and targeting these barriers is critical for converting immune-cold tumors into immune-infiltrated, therapy-responsive states. We conclude with a perspective on the future of immunoengineering and immune-atlas integration to optimize CD8+ T-cell–based interventions in solid tumors.">

The development of tumor is driven by genetic factors, environmental exposures, and homeostatic disruptions, leading to the transformation of normal cells into malignant ones. Natural killer (NK) cells, a crucial class of immune cells in immunotherapy, can directly recognize and eliminate tumor cells without prior stimulation by tumor antigens. Exosomes derived from NK cells exert anti-tumor effects through multiple mechanisms, including the release of cytotoxic molecules, death receptor ligand-mediated apoptosis, and the secretion of cytokines and other bioactive molecules. However, the therapeutic efficacy of unmodified exosomes is constrained by insufficient active components, suppression by the tumor microenvironment, and a lack of targeting specificity. Drug loading and engineering strategies can enhance their therapeutic potential. In this review, we examine advancements in NK cell-derived exosome (NK-Exos)-based anti-tumor strategies, focusing on studies involving native exosomes, drug-loaded exosomes, and surface-modified exosomes for tumor eradication.">

Pairing ferroptosis inducers and inhibitors with immunotherapies ex vivo and in vivo highlighted a central role for ferroptosis in stimulating the anti-melanoma immune response. In co-culture models, CD8+ T cells drove melanoma cell ferroptosis by altering the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a crucial antioxidant enzyme known for its role in preventing lipid peroxidation. Direct contact between tumor cells and CD8+ T cells was needed to sustain GPX4 downregulation over time, resulting in ferroptotic cell death. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data from human melanoma tumors responding to immunotherapy revealed a ferroptosis signature that mirrors the mouse model. Together, these results offer crucial insights into the role of ferroptosis in antitumor immunity and highlight the potential of modulating ferroptosis to enhance immunotherapy responses.">

 Despite recent advances in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) biology and new therapies, this aggressive subtype remains difficult to treat. A key obstacle is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), often dominated by myeloid cells that impair anti-tumor immunity. Radiation therapy (RT), used as an in-situ vaccine, enhances tumor immunogenicity and has shown promise when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical and clinical settings1-3. We previously found that combining RT with CTLA-4 blockade and a CD40 agonist antibody (CD40a), which activates myeloid cells, led to profound tumor regression and occasional complete responses in a rapidly metastasizing TNBC mouse model4. However, CD40a did not improve control of lung metastases beyond that achieved with RT and CTLA-4 blockade. In tumors, CD40a induced remodeling of dendritic cell and macrophage populations, along with enrichment in B cell–associated gene signatures. As CD40 signaling can promote either effector or regulatory B cell responses depending on context5, we hypothesized that triple therapy induces organ-specific B cell differentiation that may hinder systemic immune control. We first assessed systemic versus local effects of CD40a on B cells in naïve and tumor-bearing (4T1) mice. In both settings, CD40a expanded splenic B cells and increased MHC-II+ expression. In lungs, tumor implantation alone led to increased B cell infiltration, even without CD40a. However, these lung B cells showed reduced activation in untreated tumor-bearing mice, only partially restored by CD40a, suggesting a distinct, potentially immunosuppressive phenotype. To evaluate this in the context of RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a, we analyzed B cells from lungs and tumors via multiparametric flow cytometry and observed that CD40a consistently shifted B cell profiles across compartments. Among B cells, we identified regulatory B cells (Breg) as expressing TIM1, CD138, CD5, CD39, and FasL. CD40a decreased Breg infiltration in tumors but significantly increased it in lungs. In both tissues, Breg marker expression correlated with tumor or lung burden. Given TIM1’s role in IL-10–producing Bregs—and its capacity to suppress T cells independently of IL-10—6-8 we tested a TIM1-blocking antibody in combination with RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a. While TIM1 blockade did not enhance tumor control, it markedly reduced lung Bregs. Our data highlight organ-specific B cell responses following CD40a-based immunotherapy and suggest that lung-resident Bregs may limit systemic immune efficacy. Ongoing work focuses on defining mechanisms of Breg-mediated suppression and, in collaboration with bioengineers, on developing intra-tumoral delivery strategies to reduce systemic immunosuppressive effects of agents like CD40a. 1-PMID: 29180535 2-PMID: 33476307 3-PMID: 30397353 4-PMID: 37620372 5-PMID: 19265127 6-PMID: 25582854 7-PMID: 31511630 8-PMID: 31685302

        <tr id="Background The programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1 or PD-1) is a key regulatory immune checkpoint and a major target for therapeutic intervention. In oncology, antibodies blocking the PD-1 pathway are used to activate immune cells to promote anti tumour immunity while in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, PD-1 agonist molecules have the potential to achieve immune suppression. NK cells are a specialised population of innate lymphocytes able to recognize a large range of distressed cells including damaged tissues in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Of note, NK cells can upregulate PD-1 expression upon activation and their effector functions can be modulated by the PD-1 signalling pathway. Methods We have generated a novel bispecific inhibitory molecule, comprised of a targeting domain highly specific for a pre-pro-insulin peptide presented by the HLA-A*02 molecules on the cell surface of pancreatic β-cells and a PD-1 agonist effector domain. Suppressive effects of the β-cell tethered bispecific PD-1 agonist molecule on NK cells and NK92-PD-1 cell line activation were assessed through gene expression, cell surface expression of the CD107a degranulation marker, intracellular IFNγ production and Granzyme B secretion. EndoC-b cells proliferation and insulin production were also measured. Results We observed that the bispecific PD-1 agonist molecules tethered to pancreatic b-cells accumulate at the immunological synapse, modify NK cell gene expression and decrease their inflammatory and cytotoxic functions. Conclusions Targeted PD-1 agonist molecules, inhibiting T cells and NK cells in a tissue-specific manner offer a new promising treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.">

 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are major negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Identifying tumor secreting factors and signaling pathways that enhance their pro-tumorigenic activity could lead to new strategies to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We have identified tumor-secreted epidermal growth factor-like 6 (EGFL6) as a new mediator of tumor immune suppression. In-vitro and ex-vivo analyses indicated that EGFL6 binds beta integrins to activate spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling, functioning as (i) a chemotactic factor for myeloid cell migration and (ii) a driver of their differentiation into immunosuppressive phenotypes. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer, EGFL6 expression promoted intra-tumoral accumulation of MDSCs and TAMs with high SYK, CXCL2, and IL-10 expression. In an immune ‘hot’ tumor model, EGFL6 completely abrogated the response to anti-PD-L1 therapy, whereas Egfl6 neutralization decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and MDSCs and thereby restored the efficacy of a-PD-L1 therapy. Spatial transcriptomic datasets of human ovarian cancer tissues revealed strong correlation between tumor EGFL6 and myeloid cell SYK expression. Dual immunohistochemistry confirmed increased SYK+ macrophages in ovarian cancer compared to normal ovary. We therefore tested whether SYK inhibition could hinder EGFL6-induced signaling in myeloid cells and reprogram them from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory phenotype. Treatment with the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (R788) prolonged survival in Egfl6+/- ID8p53-/- tumor-bearing mice, reduced the number of intra-tumoral granulocytic MDSCs, and decreased VEGF, M-CSF, and CXCL5 levels in ascites. scRNA-seq revealed that SYK inhibition depleted specific CCL8+ TAM and CXCL2+ MDSC subsets, induced immunostimulatory myeloid cell populations, and reduced exhausted of TIGIT+CTL4+ CD8 T cells. These findings demonstrate that targeting the EGFL6-SYK axis, via EGFL6 blockade or SYK inhibition, can reprogram the ovarian tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor immunity and restore responsiveness of “cold” tumors to immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by rapid proliferation and infiltration of immune cells into tumor microenvironment (TME). The treatment of TNBC still remains challenging due to the lack of expression of effective molecular targets pertaining to the tumor cell itself. In TNBC standard of care, therapies such as chemotherapy, together with recently introduced immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, often do not result in durable clinical response. Therefore, better understanding of complex interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells mediated by multiple cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and metabolites in TME is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that underlie tumor cell immune evasion strategies. The aim of this review is to give comprehensive overview of immune cell network and their interactions with cells in TME and possibilities for therapeutic targeting of TME in TNBC. We discuss cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as an important recently characterized player in TNBC with respect to their role in interactions with immune cells and their impact on tumor invasion. Based on the recently accumulated knowledge, therapies targeting immune suppressive mechanisms and CAF-related tumor-promoting mechanisms in TME hold great potential for clinical evaluation in TNBC.">

        <tr id="Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) has been implicated in multiple inflammatory diseases by regulating pro-inflammatory mediators or altering immune cell polarization. However, the expression and direct functional role of CB1 in T cells remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that primary murine T cells express CB1 and that its novel agonist, BI-5756, directly increases the frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in primary murine pan T cells after activation. In addition, BI-5756 exhibits an in vivo protective effect against graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), an allogeneic T cell-mediated inflammatory complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), resulting in an improved overall survival with enhanced platelet recovery and reconstitution of bone marrow-derived B and T cells. BI-5756 also directly suppresses tumor cell growth and upregulates MHC I, MHC II, and CD80 on tumor cells, which may subsequently enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses in mixed lymphocyte reaction with A20 cells. The ability of BI-5756 to increase Tregs was significantly abrogated by rimonabant, a potent and selective CB1 antagonist, suggesting that the immunomodulatory effect of BI-5756 is mediated via CB1. In summary, BI-5756, a potent CB1 agonist, increases Tregs while preserving anti-tumor responses in vitro and effectively reduces GvHD in vivo.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Aims Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play pivotal roles in inflammation and fibrosis, which are key features of chronic liver diseases. The contribution of group 1 ILCs, including natural killer (NK) cells and helper‐like ILC1s, to liver inflammation during steatohepatitis and metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver diseases (MASLD) is still a matter of debate and requires further investigation. Methods We engineered a mouse model of specific deficiency of CD44 in group 1 ILCs and challenged mice with diet‐induced obesity and MASLD or diet‐induced steatohepatitis. We performed in vitro studies and co‐cultured LPS‐stimulated liver NK cells with hepatocytes and macrophages to analyse the inflammatory response. Results As group 1 ILCs expressed the cell surface molecule CD44, its specific targeting was used to investigate if CD44 could affect the development of liver inflammation. Here, we found that CD44 deficiency in group 1 ILCs was sufficient to decrease the absolute number of hepatic NKp46+ ILCs, NK cells and ILC1s in chow diet and in response to diet induced‐MASLD or steatohepatitis. CD44 deficiency in group 1 ILCs aggravated liver complications by exacerbating hepatic injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, which was also associated with inflammatory and osteopontin+ macrophages accumulation. The absence of CD44 in NK cells enhanced their inflammatory phenotypes in response to LPS, which in turn triggered release of pro‐inflammatory mediators by hepatocytes and macrophages. Conclusions Our findings reveal a novel role for CD44 in regulating the dynamics of group 1 ILCs, which in turn affects steatohepatitis and MASLD development.">

 Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) is a cutting-edge treatment strategy modulating T cell activity and has emerged at the forefront of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management, yet most patients do not durably respond. Studies have shown that innate immune cells could create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) thus, resulting in resistance to ICB. Therefore, to design an effective therapeutic strategy, it is imperative to consider the diverse immune cells and their complex interactome. In noncancerous conditions, pro-inflammatory neutrophils release extracellular traps or NETs that interfere with monocyte differentiation to macrophages. However, their interaction and its effect in mediating immune evasion in NSCLCs is poorly understood.



 To study the role of neutrophils in macrophage behaviour, freshly isolated monocytes were differentiated into pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages and polarized with or without NETs. These NETs-educated macrophages (NeMacs) were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Functionally, their role in the TME was investigated using a Tumor-Immune-Microenvironment on-chip (TIMEoC) platform. Here, immune cells such as donor matched T cells or neutropils were loaded into a microfluidic channel magnetically attached to active NSCLC spheroids embedded in a collagenous matrix containing NeMacs. T-cell or neutrophil migration and tumor cytotoxicity in the presence of NeMacs were monitored on TIMEoC.



 In the presence of NETs, macrophages presented an immunosuppresive phenotype with significantly reduced expression of CD80, a key co-stimulatory receptor for T cell activation. NeMacs recruited significantly more neutrophils to the tumor than M2-like macrophages. In contrast, NeMacs retarded activated CD8+ T cell migration to the TME and significantly impacted their cytotoxic abilities observed by caspase 3/7 expression. The presence of NeMacs also affected ICB efficacy in vitro.



 Therefore, NETs could reprogram macrophages to create an immune-suppressive TME. This study was able to unveil previously unexplored relationship between NETs and macrophages in NSCLCs which could help identify prospective targets that could augment the current standard of care.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is defined by a myeloid-enriched microenvironment and has shown remarkable resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD-1 and CTLA-4). Here, we sought to define the role of myeloid immunosuppression in immune resistance in PDA. We report that depletion of CSF1R+ myeloid cells in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy triggers T cell infiltration into PDA but causes compensatory remodeling of the myeloid compartment with limited tumor control. Unexpectedly, combined therapy against multiple myeloid targets including CSF1R, CCR2/5 and CXCR2 was insufficient to overcome treatment resistance. High-dimensional single cell analyses performed on T cell infiltrates in human and mouse PDA revealed upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4. Combinatorial blockade of PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 along with chemotherapy and anti-CSF1R was necessary to trigger activation of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and led to deep, durable, and complete tumor responses, with each immune checkpoint blockade agent contributing to efficacy. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive approach targeting both negative regulatory signals controlling T cell function and the myeloid compartment will be fundamental to unveiling the potential of immunotherapy in PDA.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of tumor cells, stromal cells, infiltrating immune cells and non-cellular components such as extracellular matrix, blood vessels and a wide variety of secreted proteins. Evidence shows that beyond supporting tumor growth, the TME also promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion and contributes to treatment resistance, ultimately affecting patient prognosis. Cell-to-cell communication within the TME is driven by secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and interferons, which are produced not only by tumor cells but also by various stromal cells and immune cells. These proteins form a complex signaling network that promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion and enables tumors to evade innate and adaptive immune responses. Antibody arrays are a technology that can simultaneously screen hundreds of secreted proteins in complex biological samples, aiding in the exploration of this complex signaling network. By combining high-throughput multiplex immunoassays such as antibody arrays with cellular and molecular biology techniques, researchers have uncovered complex regulatory mechanisms of cytokine networks within the TME. The present review summarized recent findings on the communication between tumor cells and the TME, as well as key secreted proteins essential for tumor progression and the development of therapeutic resistance. In addition, it discusses how high-throughput antibody arrays contribute to our understanding of regulatory networks of secreted proteins in the TME.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a formidable malignancy with persistently poor clinical outcomes. Recent research has underscored the pivotal role of the innate immune system, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the myeloid lineage, in orchestrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and shaping disease progression. As professional phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages not only mediate pathogen recognition and inflammatory responses but also undergo functional polarization in response to local cues. In OSCC, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, marked by the overrepresentation of species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis—acts as a chronic inflammatory trigger that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune evasion, and tumor growth. These pathogenic bacteria actively engage innate immune signaling pathways such as TLRs and CSF-1R, skewing macrophages toward an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. M2-like TAMs then contribute to tumor progression by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), promoting angiogenesis, and expressing immune checkpoint ligands such as PD-L1. This review summarizes current knowledge on the bidirectional crosstalk between dysbiotic microbiota and innate immune macrophages in OSCC, highlighting key receptor-mediated pathways and their implications for immune suppression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting microbiota modulation or innate immune reprogramming represents a promising strategy for restoring anti-tumor immunity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy in OSCC.">

        <tr id="Glioblastomas are the most prevalent and malignant primary cancers in the brain. Given the promising prospects of immunotherapeutic approaches, there is increasing interest in obtaining precise knowledge of the immunologic status of the tumour microenvironment for each individual. We explored the feasibility of inferring this tumour immune component in a minimally invasive manner prior to any clinical intervention, taking advantage of the preoperative immune cell counts that can be easily obtained from the clinical records of the patients. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is the most extensive measure calculated from complete counts of peripheral blood. Despite there was an increase in the NLR in high grade tumours of our cohorts of study, we did not find evidence of any correlation between the NLR and different degrees of tumour immune infiltration in glioblastoma. The same negative result was obtained with the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR). In addition, glioblastomas associated with extreme values of peripheral NLR did not exhibit substantial gene expression differences that could be linked to distinct tumourigenic properties. Overall, these results suggest that peripheral immune cell ratios cannot be used to reliably infer the immune microenvironment within the tumour, underscoring the complexity of using peripheral markers to assess local tumour immunity.

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with limited responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies in most patients. Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a crucial role in immunotherapy outcomes. Among various metabolic abnormalities in the TIME, dysregulated lipid metabolism has emerged as a critical determinant of immune cell fate, differentiation, and function. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the current understanding of the immune landscape in GC, focusing on how altered lipid metabolism reshapes immune cell populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We highlight key metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation(FAO), cholesterol homeostasis, and lipid uptake that impact immune cell activity, contributing to immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Importantly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism, including inhibitors of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and discuss their synergistic potential when combined with ICB therapies. In conclusion, lipid metabolic reprogramming represents a promising yet underexplored axis in modulating antitumor immunity in GC. Integrating metabolic intervention with immunotherapy holds potential to overcome current treatment limitations and improve clinical outcomes. Future studies incorporating spatial omics and single-cell profiling will be essential to elucidate cell-type specific metabolic dependencies and foster translational breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal regulators of immune responses, capable of initiating robust adaptive immunity through antigen presentation. As the most potent antigen-presenting cells, they have emerged as central components of cancer immunotherapy. Over the last decade, advances in molecular engineering, bioinformatics, and nanomedicine have transformed the design of DC-based vaccines. Strategies now include personalized neoantigen loading, mRNA-electroporation, nanoparticle-mediated delivery, and combinatorial regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, emerging approaches that target DC subsets in vivo, especially cDC1s, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy in preclinical and early clinical studies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological roles of DCs and evaluates the evolution of DC vaccine platforms while also highlighting new technologies and clinical insights that aim to tumor-induced immunosuppression suppression and improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Tumor antigen–escape variants undermine immunotherapy by subverting lymphocyte effector functions and reshaping tumor–immune dynamics. It is essential to delineate functional interplay within immune networks during tumor progression. We investigated whether homeostatic crosstalk between CD8+T cells and natural killer (NK) cells preempts tumor antigen–escape. Adoptive CD8+T cell transfers were administered before (D–7, homeostatic pre-priming) or after (D+1) tumor establishment in Rag1−/− and Rag1−/−γc−/− mice. Antigen presentation, immune activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory were quantified by flow cytometry, live bioluminescence and confocal imaging. Monoculture, co-culture, and a 3D silica nanofiber carpet mimicking basement-membrane-like topography modeled intercellular interactions. Signaling arrays and motion metrics (Speed-Distance Index, deceleration) were conducted. Human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK crosstalk were probed in silico.Pre-tumor D–7 CD8+T cell transfer completely suppressed antigen–escape tumors with NK cells as major effectors showing elevated CD25, CD69, CD107a, and GzmB, marking activated and effector phenotype, and promoting central-memory CD62L⁺CD44⁺CD8⁺TCM precursors. By contrast, post-tumor D+1–transferred CD8+T cells allowed emergence of tumor variants resistant to antigen-specific cytolysis as assessed on day 25, despite those T cells retaining higher intrinsic cytotoxic capacity than the D–7 T cell cohort. Mechanistically, CD8+T and NK cells formed stable contacts through pseudopodial intercellular nanotubes enabling bidirectional membrane exchange and signaling via STAT, Akt, and mTOR pathways, augmenting NK effector function and promoting CD8+TCM differentiation. In silico analysis identified human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK adhesion, stimulatory and regulatory axes, including CD200–CD200R, PD-L1–PD-1, and CD18/CD11a–DNAM-1 (CD226). Together, data support a three-phase model of preemptive immunosurveillance initiated by early CD8⁺T–NK crosstalk.Homeostatic conditioning and effector cooperativity between CD8+T and NK cells protect against tumor immune escape. The findings uncover a mechanistic axis of preemptive immunosurveillance that lays the foundation for next-generation preventive immunotherapies to control antigen–escape tumors.">

Treatment with inosine-producing bacteria or inosine alone restored T cell responsiveness through a nuclear factor interleukin 3 (NFIL3)- dependent mechanism. 1 To model early-life dysbiosis, the authors pretreated pregnant dams with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX). Microbiota transfer from these mothers to their offspring was impaired, with notably reduced transmission of Lactobacillaceae and Bi ﬁ dobacteriaceae . Infection of dysbiotic infant mice with in ﬂ uenza A (H1N1) revealed a diminished virus-speci ﬁ c CD8 + T cell effector response in the lungs and draining lymph nodes concomitant with lung damage and mortality. Moreover, rechallenge in recovered 8-week-old mice with H1N1 or the heterosubtypic, CD8 + T cell cross-reactive strain H3N2 further demonstrated an impaired viral-speci ﬁ c immune response later in life. This emphasizes the importance of perinatal microbiota-mediated immune priming to effectively protect against viral 1 - and bacterial pathogens. 2 Still, ABX treatment during a critical developmental window may also directly impact T cell function and warrants further investigation. This ﬁ nding was strengthened by analyses of human lung tissue samples. T cells isolated from post-mortem human tissue of ABX-exposed infants showed impaired T cell differentiation and effector function compared to ABX-naïve infants.

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, whose progression is intimately linked to the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Exosomes, once considered mere cellular waste, have emerged as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication within the TME, actively participating in the multistep development of HCC. These nanoscale vesicles play crucial roles in the initiation of precancerous lesions and, by transporting drug resistance-related molecules such as proteins and non-coding RNAs, facilitate the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies by tumor cells. Moreover, exosomes contribute to the establishment of pre-metastatic niches by remodeling distant organ microenvironments—inducing hypoxia, metabolic reprogramming, and angiogenesis—which collectively create favorable conditions for tumor cell colonization. They also modulate immune responses by inducing T-cell exhaustion, promoting macrophage polarization, and disrupting normal stromal cell functions, thereby constructing an immunosuppressive microenvironment that enables tumor immune evasion. Given their inherent biocompatibility and targeting capabilities, engineered exosomes have shown promise in cancer therapy, serving as carriers for therapeutic molecules and enabling precise drug delivery through surface modifications. Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in elucidating the in vivo regulatory mechanisms of exosomes, standardizing their isolation and purification processes, and evaluating their clinical efficacy. This review examines the multifaceted roles of exosomes in HCC, aiming to bridge mechanistic insights with precision diagnostics and pave new avenues for liver cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are DNA-protein structures released during a form of programmed neutrophil death known as NETosis. While NETs have been implicated in both tumor inhibition and promotion, their functional role in cancer remains ambiguous. In this study, we compared the NET-forming capacity and functional effects of NETs derived from lung cancer (LC) patients and healthy donors (H). Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood and stimulated in vitro with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce NETosis. Isolated NETs were quantified and assessed for their cytotoxicity against A549 lung cancer cells and their impact on cancer cell migration. Whereas LC neutrophils (LCN) were less cytotoxic to tumor cells than H neutrophils (HN), their NETs maintained similar tumoricidal capacity – 41.6% ± 25.3% (LCN) vs. 46.4% ± 14.5% (HN), ns. Interestingly, we noted a correlation between the amount of NETs and their cytotoxicity to tumor cells. This effect could not be recapitulated with purified genomic DNA, inducing only 3.99% of cytotoxicity to tumor cells, and confirming that intact NETs are required for the anti-tumor activity. LCN displayed an increased frequency of NETosis following PMA stimulation, yet produced significantly fewer NETs per cell – 1569 ± 306 ng (LCN) vs. 2619 ± 313 ng (HN); p = 0.025. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was elevated in LC neutrophils, indicating that the NETosis defect was not due to impaired oxidative burst. LCN had increased expression of immunosuppression (PDL-1) as well as exhaustion and aging markers CD62L and CD11b). Only NETs from HN inhibited the migration of A549 tumor cells, whereas those from LCN failed to suppress, and in some cases appeared to enhance, cell motility. Our data suggest that NETs in lung cancer retain anti-tumor cytotoxicity capabilities but lose their anti-migratory capacity, highlighting their dual role in tumor biology and potential as therapeutic targets.">

However, mononuclear phagocyte system-mediated clearance of liposome encapsulated Re188 (Lipo-Re188) limits its tumor delivery. This study aimed to enhance the therapeutic effect of Lipo-Re188 against lung metastases through macrophage depletion and immune checkpoint blockade. A lung metastatic colon cancer model was established via intravenous injection of CT26-luciferase cells and then treated with Lipo-Re188 (11.1 MBq, 30% of MTD), liposomal clodronate (Lipo-clod) for macrophage depletion, and/or anti-PD-L1 antibody. Tumor progression was monitored by bioluminescence imaging, and radionuclide biodistribution was assessed at 1, 24, and 48 h post-injection. Flow cytometry was used to assess immune cell populations in the spleen and tumor microenvironment (TME). Cytokine levels were measured using a bead-based multiplex assay and analyzed by flow cytometry. Macrophage depletion significantly enhanced tumor accumulation of Lipo-Re188 while reducing hepatic uptake and prolonging survival. The combination of Lipo-clod and Lipo-Re188 promoted B cells, restored functional T cells, and suppressed MDSC in both spleen and TME. Notably, IL-1α and GM-CSF levels were significantly elevated in the combination group. Triple therapy with Lipo-clod, Lipo-Re188, and anti-PD-L1 provided the greatest survival benefit, highest intratumoral B cell accumulation, and lowest interstitial macrophage levels, with no significant biological toxicity. Our study reveals that triple therapy overcomes immunosuppressive feedback and promotes a tumor-suppressive microenvironment. These findings support a rational combination strategy integrating radiopharmaceutical therapy with immune modulation for metastatic cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Background The hematopoietic ecosystem comprises both cellular components such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and immune cells as well as non-cellular components including iron. Systemic iron overload, which leads to serious complications and affects both patients’ quality of life and overall survival, is a common clinical challenge in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously elucidated the direct effects of iron overload on AML cells. It’s worth noting that iron overload remodels the hematopoietic ecosystem. However, whether and how remodeled leukemic microenvironment with overloaded iron regulates normal HSCs and immune cells, especially leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs), in AML have not been elucidated. Methods The MLL-AF9-induced AML (MA9) cells were originated from c-kit+ BM cells enriched from C57BL/6J mice that infected with MSCV-MLL-AF9-GFP retrovirus. The MA9 AML mouse model was established by transplantation of MA9 cells into C57BL/6 mice. MA9 mice were i.p. administered with iron dextran every other day for a total of 6 times to established the iron overload MLL-AF9-induced AML mouse model (MA9/FE). HSC maintenance and differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, colony forming and competitive transplantation assays. LAM activation and function was analyzed by RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry and coculture assay. Intravenous clodronate liposome administration was employed to reduce LAMs in AML. Results Iron overload skewed myeloid differentiation of normal HSCs. Furthermore, iron overload affected LAMs in the AML microenvironment by promoting LAM polarization toward an M2 phenotype. Functionally, iron overload decreased the phagocytic function of LAMs against leukemia cells and inhibited LAM-induced T cell activation by acquiring a tolerogenic phenotype with aberrant immune checkpoints. Moreover, depletion of LAMs attenuated iron overload caused acceleration of AML progression. Conclusions Collectively, this study reveals the significance of iron overload in remodeling hematopoietic ecosystem and affecting HSC and LAM function in AML, providing new insights into the multifaceted role of iron overload in leukemia.">

        <tr id="A major goal in regenerative medicine is restoring damaged tissues through cell replacement or by activating endogenous repair pathways. Immune modulation is increasingly recognized as essential for creating a permissive environment for regeneration. Bioactive factors secreted by stem and stromal cells -either as soluble molecules or within extracellular vesicles (EVs)- can reshape immune responses, not just by reducing inflammation but by actively promoting pro-resolving, regenerative profiles. For nearly two decades, our research has focused on the therapeutic potential of human term placenta-derived cells, particularly mesenchymal stromal cells from the amniotic membrane (hAMSC). We have shown that hAMSC and their secretome (CM-hAMSC) exert potent immunomodulatory effects in vitro: suppressing T- and B-cell proliferation, downregulating proinflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotypes, enhancing regulatory T cells, and inhibiting naïve CD8 T cell polarization into memory subsets. They also reduce B-cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells and steer monocytes away from dendritic cells and M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. These effects have translated into therapeutic benefits in numerous preclinical models of inflammation-driven disease (including lung/liver fibrosis, sepsis, IBD, cardiac ischemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and traumatic brain injury) by tempering inflammation and promoting resolution. Ongoing studies aim to dissect the mechanisms driving these effects, especially whether they are mediated by soluble molecules, EVs, or both. A key area of interest is their ability to modulate the inflammasome pathway, a central driver of innate immunity linked to aging and degeneration. By regulating this pathway, placental factors may redirect chronic inflammation toward regeneration. Given inflammation’s dual role as trigger and barrier in many degenerative conditions, placental cells -especially those from the amniotic membrane- emerge as a powerful paradigm. This lecture will explore how their unique immunological properties can inspire innovative regenerative strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). CD4+ CD25+hi Tregs, which normally suppress immune responses, exhibit impaired function in MS. Treg-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry immunoregulatory proteins and miRNAs that modulate T-cell activity. However, EVs from MS patients show reduced suppressive capacity, suggesting their dysfunction contributes to MS pathogenesis. This highlights EVs' potential role in MS development and therapy. Methods: Tregs were differentiated from naïve T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donor, then transduced with B2M-shRNA lentivirus to generate HLA class I-knockdown Tregs. Extracellular vesicles—including natural vesicles, cytochalasin B-induced artificial vesicles, and ultrasound-induced artificial vesicles—were isolated from Tregs and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), flow cytometry, and Western blot. Their effects on healthy donor and MS patient PBMCs were evaluated via flow cytometry and ELISA (IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ). Results: Ultrasonication yielded a higher number оf vesicles enriched with key immunosuppressive proteins, including PD-1 and Tim-3, compared to cytochalasin B. Functional assays demonstrated the ability оf ultrasonication-induced AVs to suppress inflammatory markers, such as IFNγ, and modulate the cytokine profile in both healthy and MS-derived PBMCs. Conclusion: Developing effective MS therapies remains challenging. While cellular therapies face limitations like Treg dysfunction and CNS delivery issues, allogeneic EVs offer a promising alternative due to their scalability, low immunogenicity, and blood-brain barrier penetration. We developed Treg-derived artificial vesicles (TrAVs) that maintain immunosuppressive properties and modulate PBMC responses, suggesting therapeutic potential for MS. Further research is needed to optimize production and validate efficacy in disease models.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapies, including cell therapies, are effective anti-cancer agents. However, cellular product persistence can be limiting with short functional duration of activity contributing to disease relapse. A variety of manufacturing protocols are used to generate therapeutic engineered T-cells; these differ in techniques used for T-cell isolation, activation, genetic modification, and other methodology. We sought to determine how preselection affected the phenotype of T cells engineered to secrete a CD123xCD3 bispecific engager (ENG-T). These cells were designed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We evaluated the effect of T-cell selection on transduction efficiency, T-cell activation, short- and long-term anti-AML cytotoxicity, and gene transcription. Unselected, CD4, CD8, and CD4/CD8 pre-selected ENG-T cells have minor differences in T-cell subset components, equivalent activation, and equal cytotoxicity in short-term assays. While unselected and CD4/CD8-selected ENG-T cells have identical CD4:CD8 composition prior to target cell exposure, serial stimulation in vitro showed CD4/CD8 pre-selection supports ENG-T cell survival and long-term activity. Likewise, CD4 and CD4/CD8 pre-selected ENG-T cells display superior anti-tumor efficacy and prolong murine survival in AML xenografts. Unselected ENG-T cells are exposed to cytokines during early manufacture that imprint upregulation of intracellular inflammatory pathways. This early activation likely underpins long-term observed functional differences. Pre-selection of T cells from banked patient biospecimens decreased blast contamination, exposure to inflammatory cytokines, and may improve T-cell expansion during manufacture. Pre-selection of T-cell products should continue to be performed to enhance the quality of clinical cellular therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Immunoinhibitory molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), contribute to T-cell exhaustion in chronic infections. In a sheep model of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, PD-L1 expression was correlated with BLV proviral load, and TIM-3 expression was upregulated in multiple T-cell subsets. Moreover, TIM-3 blockade, alone or combined with PD-L1 inhibition, enhanced T-cell activation and cytokine production, while PD-L1 blockade alone had limited effects. These findings demonstrate that TIM-3 plays a role in T-cell dysfunction in sheep and support the use of sheep as a model for evaluating immunotherapies targeting immunoinhibitory molecules in BLV infection and other chronic infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal primary brain malignancy in adults, and therapeutic gains have been modest despite multimodal standard care. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative, yet its performance in GBM is constrained by a profoundly immunosuppressive neuro-immune micro-environment, the physical and functional barriers of the blood–brain interface, and adaptative resistance pathways. In this review we summarise recent progress in myeloid-reprogramming agents, immune-checkpoint modulation, adoptive cellular therapies and device-enabled delivery platforms that seek to revitalise anti-tumour surveillance within the central nervous system. We also discuss enduring challenges—including intratumoural spatial heterogeneity, limited effector lymphocyte trafficking and the scarcity of robust predictive biomarkers—that temper durable responses. By thoughtfully integrating immunologic approaches with radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, metabolic modifiers and focussed-ultrasound-mediated blood–brain-barrier disruption, emerging strategies aspire to enhance immune infiltration, bolster antigen presentation and overcome region-specific barriers. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of precision immunotherapy for GBM, offering perspective on future directions and avenues for clinical translation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavour to develop more effective and individualised treatment regimens for patients confronted with this formidable disease.">

        <tr id="Immune organoids have emerged as a ground-breaking platform in immunology, offering a physiologically relevant and controllable environment to model human immune responses and evaluate immunotherapeutic strategies. Derived from stem cells or primary tissues, these three-dimensional constructs recapitulate key aspects of lymphoid tissue architecture, cellular diversity, and functional dynamics, providing a more accurate alternative to traditional two-dimensional cultures and animal models. Their ability to mimic complex immune microenvironments has positioned immune organoids at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy development, autoimmune disease modeling, and personalized medicine. This narrative review highlights the advances in immune organoid technology, with a focus on their applications in testing immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and cancer vaccines. It also explores how immune organoids facilitate the study of autoimmune disease pathogenesis with insights into their molecular basis and support in high-throughput drug screening. Despite their transformative potential, immune organoids face significant challenges, including the replication of systemic immune interactions, standardization of fabrication protocols, scalability limitations, biological heterogeneity, and the absence of vascularization, which restricts organoid size and maturation. Future directions emphasize the integration of immune organoids with multi-organ systems to better replicate systemic physiology, the development of advanced biomaterials that closely mimic lymphoid extracellular matrices, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize organoid production and data analysis, and the rigorous clinical validation of organoid-derived findings. Continued innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to overcome existing barriers, enabling the widespread adoption of immune organoids as indispensable tools for advancing immunotherapy, vaccine development, and precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening disease caused by a dysfunctional host response to infection. During sepsis, inflammation-related immunosuppression is the critical factor causing secondary infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The regulatory mechanisms underlying regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and function, which significantly contribute to septic immunosuppression, require further clarification. In this study, we found that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) participated in the development of sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation and function via direct interaction with CD4+ T cells. Briefly, NETs anchored enolase 1 (ENO1) on the membrane of CD4+ T cells through its key protein myeloperoxidase (MPO) and subsequently recruited interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2). IFITM2 acted as a DNA receptor that sensed NETs-DNA and activated intracellular RAS-associated protein 1B (RAP1B) and its downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway to promote Treg differentiation and function. ENO1 inhibition significantly attenuated NETs-induced Treg differentiation and alleviated sepsis in mice. Overall, we demonstrated the role of NETs in sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation, identified ENO1 as an anchor of NETs-MPO, and elucidated the downstream molecular mechanism by which IFITM2-RAP1B-ERK regulated Treg differentiation. These findings improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of sepsis and provide potential therapeutic targets for sepsis-induced immunosuppression.">

 Ovarian cancer (OC) has an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment (TME) with poor responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Understanding tumor immune-cell interactions is critical to overcome barriers to ICB. There is growing evidence that the chromatin remodeler complex, mammalian switch/sucrose non-fermentable (mSWI/SNF) affects downstream immune pathways in cancer. Our previous study has shown that loss-of-function as well as therapeutic inhibition of the mSWI/SNF subunit, SMARCA4, leads to increased immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo. We found that SMARCA4 loss in OC cell lines leads to increased MHC1 antigen presentation and upregulation of interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, including IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and RNA sensors involved in the anti-viral RNA sensing pathway. Our in vivo results show anti-tumor immune suppression of SMARCA4-KO OC tumors, resulting from a more active innate and adaptive immune TME. We further demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of SMARCA4 gene product BRG1 can recapitulate these findings in vitro and in vivo. An epigenetic library screen of SMARCA4-mutated OC cells revealed DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) as a top hit. There is evidence that therapeutic inhibition of this target may synergize in the context of SMARCA4 inhibition by activating ISGs through increased gene accessibility and transcription from decreased histone methylation. Based on our previous data, we hypothesize that combination of BRG1 inhibitor (BRG1i) and DNMT inhibition can reverse immune evasion in the OC TME and sensitize OCs to ICB. Using murine syngeneic and human OC cell lines, the expression of type I IFN and antigen presentation genes are characterized in vitro to demonstrate the immunogenic effect of dual epigenetic therapy. Combined BRG1 and DNMT1 inhibition in murine OC cells ID8 TP53-/- results in an increased fold change of ISG expression by RT-qPCR when compared to monotherapy. These results were validated in the human OC cells. Furthermore, combination therapy in murine and human cells increases the expression of antigen presentation marker MHC1 at the cells surface. In vivo, we observed a trend towards decreased tumor burden and the prevention of ascites development with dual epitherapy. Immune cell infiltration and activation in the TME will be subsequently investigated. Moreover, in an ongoing pilot study the anti-tumor response to anti-PD1 ICB combined with both epitherapies yields decreased tumor growth compared to both anti-PD1 alone and dual therapy alone. Taken together, these data uncover potential therapeutically innovative ways to exploit functional characteristics of epigenetic modulation and are immediately relevant to the design of next generation OC therapeutics.

 CD8 T cells are effector cells of the adaptive immune system responsible for mediating protective immune responses in cancer. However, CD8 T cells can also be critical drivers of pathologic responses including autoimmunity. A key feature of these cells is that they must infiltrate tissues to execute their primary function of cell killing. It is well established that naive T cell responses do not originate in these tissues. Rather, prior to antigen-driven activation, naïve T cells are restricted to lymph nodes, spleen, and blood. T cell activation by cognate antigen drives expression of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors, including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and/or cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), as well as migration to nonlymphoid tissues. Work over the last two decades has harnessed T cell effector activities by blocking PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, which has revolutionized cancer care and demonstrated remarkable efficacy in diverse cancer types. However, many patients do not respond to checkpoint blockade therapy, and worse, other patients develop autoimmune-like immune-related adverse events (irAEs), limiting the utility of this approach. To maximize the therapeutic benefit of checkpoint blockade without accelerated irAE development, targeted approaches are needed to increase recruitment of protective CD8 T cells to tumors while preventing pathogenic T cell entry into sensitive tissues. However, an inability to granularly measure recruitment into non-lymphoid tissues has created a significant gap in knowledge in: 1) how checkpoint inhibitors impact T cell entry rates into tissues, 2) whether these entry rates are different for tumors and lesional irAE tissues, 3) where recruited cells localize, and 4) the precise functional contributions of recruited versus resident T cells in driving tumor regression or autoimmunity. To fill this gap in knowledge, we are utilizing an intravenous antibody labeling approach to mark CD8 T cells in the blood prior to entry into tissues, an approach which enables a 72-hour window to track tissue entry. Using this approach in the preclinical setting, we are interrogating how PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cell recruitment to tumors as well as the pancreas in the context of Type 1 Diabetes. In our tumor studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors induce an increase in the number of recently recruited CD8 T cells, and that these recruited T cells have a less exhausted phenotype than the T cells that have been in the tumor for longer. In our diabetes studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cells both in the periphery and the pancreas, and in some mice cause an increase in migration to the pancreas. These studies support a model where peripheral CD8 T cell recruitment can positively contribute to productive anti-tumor immunity but can also exacerbate autoimmunity. Thus, our studies emphasize the doubled-edged nature of T cell recruitment, and our future studies will examine ways to both improve recruitment to tumors and mitigate recruitment to lesional irAE tissues.

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, revolutionizing cancer treatment paradigms. Since the groundbreaking development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka in 2008, significant progress has been made in generating various iPSCs-derived immunocytes, including T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells. These engineered immune cells offer unprecedented opportunities for personalized cancer therapy as they can be derived from patients’ own cells to minimize immune rejection. In addition, various new techniques are being used for the induction and amplification of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, such as small-molecule techniques, 3D culture systems, nanotechnology, and animal models for the in vivo amplification of immunocytes. Of course, challenges remain in improving immunocyte characteristics. Targeting efficiency needs enhancement to better distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue, while biological activity must be optimized for sustained antitumor effects. Safety concerns, particularly regarding potential off-target effects and cytokine release syndrome, require further investigation. The immunosuppressive nature of tumor microenvironment also poses significant hurdles for solid tumor treatment. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the therapeutic potential of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, with researchers investigating combination therapies and genetic modifications to overcome current limitations.">

        <tr id="Background Immune tolerance in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) enables cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as crucial immunosuppressive regulators, shape the tumor microenvironment and contribute to resistance against immunotherapy. However, the regulatory mechanisms of MDSCs in ovarian cancer remain poorly understood. Methods We examined the presence and distribution of MDSCs in peripheral blood and tumor tissues from EOC patients. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on ovarian cancer cells co-cultured with MDSCs. The role of Serum Amyloid A1 (SAA1) was investigated through in vitro functional assays, co-culture experiments, and in vivo mouse models. Results MDSCs were enriched in both peripheral blood and tumor tissues of EOC patients. SAA1 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cells after interaction with MDSCs and confirmed in tumor samples and cell lines. Functionally, SAA1 promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. It also recruited MDSCs via TLR2/4, induced the differentiation of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), and stimulated IL-1β secretion, which in turn enhanced SAA1 expression, forming a positive feedback loop. In vivo, SAA1 promoted tumor progression and ascites formation. Clinically, high levels of SAA1, IL-1β, and CD33⁺ MDSCs correlated with poor survival. Conclusion This study uncovers a novel SAA1–IL-1β feedback loop that promotes immunosuppression and progression in ovarian cancer. These findings provide insight into tumor–immune interactions and suggest a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for EOC.

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma represents the most common principal malignant bone tumor that predominantly appears among teenagers and children. While multimodal treatment methods have greatly evolved with time, survival for recurrent or metastatic disease remains low due to the resistance that accumulates during treatment. Increasing evidence identifies the tumor microenvironment (TME), in particular cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as playing an important role in imposing immune suppression, enhancing tumor aggressiveness, and mediating resistance toward immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This article gives an overview of the derivation, phenotypic heterogeneity, and mechanisms of action of CAFs during osteosarcoma, such as facilitating immune escape, survival signaling, drug efflux, regulation of genes through exosomes, and inhibiting ferroptosis. Furthermore, we present existing and new treatment methods that are centered on CAFs, such as suppression of the paracrine pathway (e.g., IL-6/STAT3, TGF-β), depletion of CAFs lineages by targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and conversion toward tumor-restraining CAFs. Other methods that are gaining popularity are targeting CAFs-releasing exosomes and metabolic liabilities. By shedding light on CAFs-based methods for imposing resistance and trying targeted treatments, this review offers insights into novel therapeutic combinations that can overcome treatment barriers and improve survival outcomes in osteosarcoma regimens.">

        <tr id="Traditional chemotherapy, a prevalent cancer treatment modality, is associated with significant side effects and often leads to treatment failure. Non-specific drug distribution and chemoresistance are the main factors contributing to this failure. Certain distinctive characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including hypoxia, acidic pH, and increased interstitial fluid pressure, render cancer cells resistant to conventional treatments. Multiple approaches have been devised to enhance the treatment efficiency of neoplasms and overcome chemoresistance. Nowadays, bacteria-based cancer therapy has garnered significant interest in both preclinical and clinical research, owing to its distinctive mechanism and various applications in eliciting host antitumor immunity. Due to their inherent tumor tropism, elevated motility, and capacity for quick colonization in the conducive TME, bacteria are increasingly being considered for targeted tumor treatment. Bacteria, rich in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), can efficiently stimulate immune cells even inside the immunosuppressive TME, boosting the particular immune detection and eradication of tumor cells. Furthermore, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (CMVs), and their derived physiological components exhibit analogous functionalities to their parental cells. This review article is representative of the latest innovations in bacteria-based immunosuppressive TME reprogramming. Additionally, the article discusses future directions in this research area, drawing on current advances. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that significantly endangers human health and hampers social development. The accumulation of eggs in the liver can lead to granuloma formation and liver fibrosis. Investigating the immune mechanisms involved may reveal new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis. Methods: We collected liver cells from both schistosome-infected mice with fibrotic livers and healthy mice for single-cell sequencing, which allowed us to explore the heterogeneity of immune cells in the fibrotic livers and to use ligand-receptor analysis to examine intercellular communication. Results: Single-cell sequencing showed significant upregulation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis in the fibrotic livers of schistosome-infected mice. Macrophages were the primary source of CXCL16, while CXCR6 was predominantly expressed in T cells. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in the livers of schistosomiasis, as well as CXCR6 in CD4+T cells and CD8+ T cells. Among different T-cell subsets, Th2 cells primarily expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR6. In CXCR6KO mice, we observed a reduced granuloma area and diminished liver fibrosis. CD4+ T cells were notably lower in the livers of CXCR6KO mice compared to wild-type mice, although there were no significant differences in CD8+ T cells and NKT cells. Furthermore, Th2 cells in the livers of CXCR6KO mice were markedly reduced, along with significant decreases in IL-13, IL-5, and IL-4 levels. In vitro, CXCR6 was significantly upregulated under Th2-polarizing conditions. Conclusions: Th2 cells are recruited to the liver via the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis, promoting granuloma formation and liver fibrosis in schistosomiasis. The CXCR6 pathway holds potential as a therapeutic target for treating schistosome-associated liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate infected or malignant cells, safeguarding surrounding tissues. Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast a T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. We demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. This model explains experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion regulation in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens ("quality") and the abundance ("quantity") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for more robust T-cell therapies.">

These discoveries have sparked growing interest in therapeutically targeting myeloid cells as a next generation strategy in cancer immunotherapy. As a complementary or alternative approach to T cell-centered immunotherapies, myeloid-directed therapies offer unique opportunities to reprogram the immune landscape, enhance antitumor responses, and overcome resistance mechanisms. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries in myeloid cell biology in cancer and discuss emerging therapeutic targets, with an emphasis on antibody-based therapies that have reached clinical development. We further provide perspective on translational challenges to implement these approaches into the clinic, and discuss how Fc-engineering and rational antibody design can optimize myeloid cell engagement and amplify their immune effector functions. Together, these advances position myeloid-directed immunotherapies as a promising approach to enhance the efficacy and durability of cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="(TAM) to improve antitumor immunity, are promising treatment strategies for many types of cancer. The signal-regulatory protein-α (Sirp-α)/CD47 axis is a key innate immune checkpoint target important in regulating phagocytosis in macrophages. We aimed to determine whether a Sirp-α monoclonal antibody (mAb) could prevent renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression by acting on macrophages and modifying their phenotype. Methods: We explored the gene expression signature of macrophages in the RCC microenvironment by analyzing transcriptome data of blood monocytes from patients with RCC vs healthy donors, and macrophages vs non-immune cells in RCC from public databases. We characterized the prevailing macrophage polarization phenotypes and the different ratios of Akt1 and Akt2 in RCC according to cell surface markers and expression profiles, prior to examining the effect of Sirp-α mAb on the M2 macrophage polarization in an in vitro co-culture model of RCC cells with macrophages. The co-culture model included human RCC cell lines and induced M2 macrophages, including a subset that had been transfected to overexpress phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Results and Conclusion: Treatment of RCC with Sirp-α mAb counteracted the enhanced migration and invasion of RCC as measured in wound healing and transwell assays and in vivo model. Collectively, our data showed that the different ratio of Akt1 and Akt2 of the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the RCC-induced M2 polarization of macrophages and that a new mechanism that the Sirp-α mAb inhibited M2 macrophage polarization by regulating components of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Elucidating the mechanism by which Sirp-α mAb inhibits the development of RCC allows us to provide a new theoretical basis for the study of the mAb in RCC immunotherapy.">

 Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. This small CD4+CD25+CD127lo T cell population develops in the thymus and peripheral tissues through expression of the epigenetically stabilized transcription factor FOXP3. Tregs mediate their tolerogenic effects via multiple mechanisms, including secretion of inhibitory cytokines, IL-2 consumption to starve effector T cells, suppression of Teff cells through metabolic disruption, and modulation of antigen-presenting cell maturation and function. Collectively, these mechanisms broadly suppress immune cell activation and effector function. Additionally, Tregs can promote tissue repair, complementing their immunosuppressive effects. Recent advances have focused on harnessing Tregs as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases, aiming to restore immune tolerance and repair tissue damage. A key to therapeutic success lies in developing a stable Treg product that preserves functional activity and lineage integrity under inflammatory conditions. Previous studies have shown that polyclonal Tregs can be administered safely to patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. The cells can be detected in the circulation at least one year after administration and in small studies the cells have been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokines produced by effector T cells.
 In this presentation, I will highlight the differences between blood Tregs and the synovial microenvironment in the joints of healthy donors versus patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Additionally, I will present early preclinical and clinical data on our first engineered product, SBT-77-7101, which expresses a citrullinated protein (CitP)-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) derived from a RA patient-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibody. These CitP CAR-Tregs retain stable phenotypic and epigenetic profiles, remain functional in inflammatory environments, recognize multiple citrullinated proteins present in diseased tissue, and are activated by synovial fluid from patients with RA. Clinical studies of SBT-77-7101 in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa will be summarized. Finally, next-generation Treg engineering strategies aimed at enhancing Treg durability and specificity will be presented including approaches to maximize Treg stability via genome editing and develop synthetic FOXP3-dependent promoters to ensure controlled CAR expression.

        <tr id="B-cell lymphomas are hematologic malignancies characterized by poor prognoses. Immunotherapy has revolutionized B-cell lymphoma treatment by harnessing immune effector cells, but current therapeutic strategies face limitations: suboptimal pharmacokinetics of bispecific antibodies and high complexity and cost of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies. To address these challenges, a bispecific nanosystem (biHSNPs) is developed that exploits the multi-functional customizability of silica nanoplatform to conjugate antibodies targeting cytotoxic T cells or natural killer cells, alongside effector antibodies specific to B-cells. Four biHSNPs with different effector and target antibodies are synthesized. This bispecific nanosystem enables simultaneous binding to immune effector cells and B-cell lymphoma antigens, facilitating the formation of artificial immunological synapses. These synapses promote immune effector cell activation, leading to the release of cytotoxic proteins, while concurrently suppressing tumor cell proliferation and enhancing T-cell activation. In vivo, biHSNPs effectively suppress tumor growth and activate T cells in a xenograft mouse model, showcasing their potential in precision therapy. Moreover, biHSNPs successfully overcome tumor immune evasion through dual-target signal blockade. Using a straightforward and scalable strategy, a bispecific nanosystem is constructed that not only addresses the limitations of current bispecific antibody therapies but also represents a promising approach for the treatment of hematological malignancies.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ranks as the sixth most prevalent malignancy worldwide, and is characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. Elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor-directed immune escape through ecological niche remodeling is crucial for advancing tumor biotherapy. The serum of patients with cancer contains not only tumor biomarkers but also immune regulators secreted by immune cells and/or cancer cells. Notably, the interstitial fluid within the cancer ecological niche is derived from serum. The cross-talk between serum and cancer cells determines the future of cancer cells, either cell survival or death. The present study revealed that serum from patients with OSCC could remodel the cancer immune escape ecological niche by promoting antigen-induced regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and T-cell exhaustion. When serum from patients with OSCC was added to a phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture system, the Treg subset was significantly increased compared with that in the culture system treated with fetal bovine serum. Moreover, when the serum of patients with OSCC was added to a PBMC culture system stimulated with tumor antigens, the activation of the CD3+ subset was significantly inhibited, and high levels of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β were detected in the supernatant; moreover, CD3+ T cells expressed high levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 and programmed death ligand 1, which is known to induce T-cell apoptosis and exhaustion. Finally, the antitumor effect of T cells were significantly decreased. These results indicated that the serum of patients with cancer can promote the inhibition and exhaustion of antitumor T cells, thereby remodeling the tumor immune escape ecological niche.">

 The dynamic evolution of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) during targeted therapy is a critical yet poorly understood determinant of treatment response and resistance. While most studies compare immune states before and after treatment, temporal immune changes during therapy remain largely uncharacterized, limiting development of effective combination strategies. Here, we investigated immune dynamics throughout targeted therapy using mouse melanoma models that recapitulate human therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified an inflection point where the inflamed TME during tumor regression, characterized by robust NK cell infiltration, transitions to an immune-excluded state upon onset of drug-tolerant residual disease. We uncovered a unique macrophage subset that orchestrates NK cell recruitment during regression. Depletion of these macrophages using LysM-cre;iDTR mice significantly reduced NK cell infiltration. Extending these findings to human cancer, longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of melanoma and lung cancer patient samples revealed dynamic NK cell infiltration during targeted therapy, establishing a direct link between innate immune remodeling and treatment outcome. Unlike prior prognostic studies assessing immune states at single time points, our results provide mechanistic evidence of a temporal relationship between NK cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy. Together, these findings position immune evolution as a driver of acquired resistance and identify macrophage–NK cell crosstalk as a therapeutically actionable axis to overcome immune exclusion and improve targeted therapy.

        <tr id="Colon cancer persists as a major global health burden due to therapy resistance and metastasis, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the microenvironment driving progression through immune evasion and angiogenesis. This review highlights plant-derived therapeutics targeting TAMs to disrupt protumor signaling. Key phytochemicals (e.g., Curcumin, Cucurbitacin B, Astragaloside IV) suppress M2 polarization via NF-κB/STAT3 inhibition, block VEGF/HIF-1α-mediated angiogenesis, and enhance antitumor immunity by downregulating PD-L1. Cannabidiol, Hydroxygenkwanin regulate TAM metabolism. Dietary agents like sulforaphane and β-glucans modulate TAM-gut microbiome crosstalk. Nanoparticle-encapsulated phytochemicals enhance TAM-targeted delivery, while clinical translation requires standardized phytopreparations and biomarker-guided trials. We propose integrating validated botanical adjuvants (e.g., Fucoidan for TLR4 inhibition, dihydroisotanshinone I for CCL2 suppression) with immunotherapies to remodel immunosuppressive niches. Phytotherapy offers a multifaceted strategy to overcome TAM-driven therapeutic barriers in colon cancer, emphasizing plant-based precision medicine to augment conventional treatments.">

        <tr id="Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus affecting 10–20 million people worldwide. While many carriers remain asymptomatic, HTLV-1 infection can trigger intense inflammatory responses which are defined by the sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Central to this process is the HTLV-1 encoded Tax oncoprotein, a viral regulator that drives uncontrolled inflammation by hijacking multiple cellular signaling pathways, such as the RelA/NF-κB signal transduction pathway. CD4 T-cells are the primary targets of Tax-mediated transformation, undergoing uncontrolled proliferation and significantly contributing to chronic immune activation seen in HTLV-1-associated diseases. However, highly activated CD4 T-cells are not alone in fueling this inflammatory “wildfire.” Other immune cells, including CD8 T-cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, also play critical roles in exacerbating the inflammatory milieu. These cells, in conjunction with CD4 T-cells, release a barrage of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α/β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-α/β, and IFN-γ) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α/β, RANTES, MCP-3, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), all of which are perpetuating the cycle of immune activation and tissue damage. This hyper stimulated immune response contributes to HTLV-1 replication/dissemination and can lead to the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM-TSP). Despite existing treatments aimed at controlling viral replication, the persistent inflammation in HTLV-1-infected individuals even in asymptomatic carriers (ACs) remains a major challenge, suggesting that targeting these pro-inflammatory responses may be another mandatory therapeutic strategy. In this context, this short-review focuses on the key immune responses that drive HTLV-1-associated inflammation and explores how these high pro-inflammatory responses contribute to the development of HTLV-1-related complications, including HAM-TSP, ATLL, and other associated inflammatory diseases during chronic viral infection.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a serious condition where cancer spreads throughout the lining of the abdominal cavity. It often occurs in late stages of cancers like ovarian, colon, or stomach cancer and is hard to treat. Patients with PC usually suffer from complications such as fluid buildup (ascites), bowel blockages, and poor nutrition, which severely impact quality of life and limit treatment options. This review focuses on a molecule called interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is part of the body’s immune system but also helps cancers grow and spread. IL-8 attracts immune cells like neutrophils that, instead of fighting the cancer, create an environment through its receptor CXCR1/CXCR2 signaling that helps tumors survive, invade new areas, and avoid immune attack. IL-8 also encourages inflammation, blood vessel growth to feed tumors, and scar tissue buildup that causes bowel obstruction. Blocking IL-8—either with specific antibodies or drugs that stop its action—has shown promise in early lab studies and clinical trials. These treatments may help reduce cancer spread, ease symptoms like ascites, and improve how well other cancer therapies work. Our review concludes that targeting IL-8 and its receptor CXCR1/CXCR2 is a promising new strategy for treating peritoneal carcinomatosis and could improve survival and quality of life for patients. More research is needed to confirm its benefits and develop combination treatments.">

LAIR1 KO, antibody blockade, and an immunotherapy that incorporates a LAIR1-inhibitory module into a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) all led to increased antitumor activity by CAR T cells, reduced M2-like TAMs, altered collagen networks, and increased survival rates in mouse tumor models.

        <tr id="Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors of glial origin accounting for about 80% of the central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. Glioma cells are known to form a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) capable of inhibiting T cell activation and protecting tumors from elimination by the immune system. One of the predominant immune inhibitory mechanisms in the TME are immune checkpoints: a complex system of membrane-bound ligands on tumor and immune cells that interact with surface receptors on T lymphocytes and affect their activation and cytotoxicity. There is mounting evidence regarding the role of immune checkpoints expressed in gliomas, in particular, their most aggressive form – glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this review, we discuss the immune checkpoints with proven expression in gliomas, their ligands, related signaling pathways, co-expression profiles, and the effects of immune cells on antitumor activity. We collected data not only on the canonical immune checkpoints (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4) but also on novel and alternative ones including soluble mediators and enzymes. We review data describing the correlation of immune checkpoint expression with patient survival as well as co-expression with other molecules involved in glioma development. Where possible, we analyzed the differences between immune checkpoints in low-grade (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG). Negative effects of several immune checkpoints on T cells could be eliminated by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between checkpoint ligands and receptors. Therefore, alongside with traditional approaches and T cell-based immunotherapy, the antibody-mediated blockade of immune checkpoints could be considered as a potentially promising therapeutic approach against gliomas.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material-based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self-marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen-presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long-term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.">

        <tr id="Resistance to immune-mediated destruction is a fundamental hallmark of cancer. Although several mechanisms have been identified that facilitate immune evasion, the transcriptional programs that orchestrate this process remain poorly understood. Here, through a genome-wide CRISPR activation screen in human cancer cells subjected to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing, we identified ZNF296, a transcription factor highly expressed in epithelial cancers, as a key driver of tumor resistance to both NK and cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated immunity. In mouse models, inhibition of ZNF296 significantly enhanced both NK and T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, leading to a marked reduction in metastasis and increased infiltration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, ZNF296 induced strong transcriptional repression of interferon-stimulated genes and key immunostimulatory ligands critical for NK and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. At the molecular level, ZNF296 directly interacted with and recruited the NuRD chromatin remodeling and deacetylase complex to the promoters of its target genes to suppress expression. Notably, treatment with low-dose romidepsin, an FDA-approved inhibitor targeting HDAC1, a core component of the NuRD complex, effectively restored NK and T cell-mediated killing in cancer cells with high ZNF296 expression. Collectively, these findings establish ZNF296 as a key regulator of immune evasion, driving resistance to both NK and T cell-mediated antitumor immunity, and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome immune resistance in epithelial cancers.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disorder due to the abnormal proliferation of clonal Plasma Cells (PCs) characterized by the increase of monoclonal immunoglobulins1. The interaction between MM cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is crucial to the progression and treatment of the disease. The PCs interaction with the hematopoietic cells induce the secretion of cytokines and growth factors, by establishing circuits that support PCs activation. In this context the malignant TIGIT positive PCs are able to interact with the T lymphocytes, a process that fuel the immune evasion, typical of the MM2. Our knowledge about the BM myeloma microenvironment is still poorly defined as well as the cellular interaction between PCs. We exploited BM biopsies of 22 MM patients. TIGIT was expressed in 86% (19/22) of evaluable samples. Among patients with PCs % >60% or FLC ratio >100, 92% were TIGIT+. Morphological differences were evident between groups: TIGIT-negative PCs were larger and altered, while TIGIT-positive PCs showed polarized nuclei and proximity to neutrophils. TIGIT-positive samples displayed increased neutrophils undergoing NETosis, as confirmed by neutrophil elastase and Ly6b co-expression (p=0.0067). Elevated IL-6 (p=0.0003) and IL-8 (p=0.004) in TIGIT-positive samples suggest a proinflammatory microenvironment promoting neutrophil recruitment and NETosis. In MM, the Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio combines a marker of inflammation and the reduced cell turnover, reflecting alteration in the immune system. TIGIT expression in the bone marrow of MM patients is associated with more aggressive disease features and an inflammatory microenvironment enriched with NET-forming neutrophils. These findings support TIGIT as a potential biomarker of disease severity and a therapeutic target in MM.">

Our study demonstrated that MDSCs and their subclasses, as well as Th17 and T helper 2 (Th2) immune responses, were enhanced. In contrast, the proportion of T helper 1 (Th1) and regulatory T (Treg) cells decreased with PMN progression. Depletion of MDSCs with gemcitabine reduced the proportion of Th17 and Th2 cells and the expression of related transcription factors. Conversely, the proportions of Th1 and Treg cells increased in the circulation, spleen, lymph nodes, and kidneys, alleviating the clinical manifestations and pathological damage to the renal tissue in PMN model mice. These findings suggest that MDSCs, along with Th17 and Th2 responses, play critical roles in PMN progression. MDSCs may contribute to disease progression by regulating the differentiation and immune response of T-cell subclasses. The data provide new insights into the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of membranous nephropathy.">

        <tr id="Background Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), ectopic lymphoid aggregates composed of immune cells, are associated with favorable clinical outcomes and increased efficacy of anti-tumor immunotherapies. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation and maturation of TLSs require further elucidation. The correlation between tumor immune microenvironment in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and TLSs remains inadequately studied. The study aimed to utilize multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to explore the relationship between TDLN and TLSs. Methods Tissue slides from 120 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were collected to perform for mIF staining. Panel 1 (DAPI, CD20, CD21, CD23) was used for the quantitative and qualitative analyses of TLS. Panel 2 (DAPI, CD4, CD8, CD20) was used to describe the immune microenvironment of the tumor and TDLN. Results TLS (+) patients showed better disease-free survival (DFS) (mDFS, 70.8 vs. 28.7 months; p = 0.013, HR = 0.555, 95% CI 0.352 to 0.875) and overall survival (OS) (mOS, 77.83 months vs. not reached; p = 0.028, HR = 0.512, 95% CI 0.289 to 0.907) compared to TLS (-) patients. B cells in the tumor and TDLN determined the formation of TLSs. A higher percentage of B cells in the tumor / B cells in the TDLN correlated with a higher number of TLSs (p < 0.0001, r = 0.349). In addition, a high percentage of TIM-1 + B cells /B cells in the TDLN was correlated with a reduced percentage of mature TLSs (p < 0.001, r=-0.441). Conclusion This study demonstrated that B cells in the tumor and TDLN play critical roles in the formation and maturation of TLS. TIM-1 + B cell is a unique immunosuppressive B cell subset that impedes the maturation of TLS and could be a promising target for improving the maturation of TLS and the prognosis of LUAD.

        <tr id="Lineage switching (LS) is the conversion of cancer cell lineage during the course of a disease. LS in leukemia cell lineage facilitates cancer cells escaping targeting strategy like CD19 targeted immunotherapy. However, the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying immune evasion by LS leukemia cells are not well understood. Here, we conduct a multi-omics analysis of patient samples and find that lineage-switched acute myeloid leukemia (LS AML) cells with KMT2A rearrangement (KMT2A-r) possess monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC)-like characteristics. Single-cell mass cytometry analysis reveals an increase in the M-MDSC like LS AML as compared to those of lineage-consistent KMT2A-r AML, and single-cell transcriptomics identify distinct expression patterns of immunoregulatory genes within this population. Furthermore, in vitro assays confirm the immunosuppressive capacity of LS AML cells against T cells, which is analogous to that of MDSCs. These data provide insight into the immunological aspects of the complex pathogenesis of LS AML, as well as development of future treatments.">

        <tr id="Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is notoriously known for exhibiting an immunologically cold phenotype in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), leading to the need for interventions to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. Recent findings by Zhao et al. in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer identified stromal monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a key enzyme that degrades monoamine neurotransmitters and plays a role in the neuroendocrine system, as a critical regulator of the immune response to PC. Altering MAOA levels in myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, either genetically or pharmacologically, can reprogram PC’s TIME to modulate CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity through the WNT5A-Ca²+-NFATC1 signaling axis, highlighting the stromal influences on CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity within the TIME. The inactivation of MAOA synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapies to reverse the trajectory of prostate tumor growth. This work offers a promising therapeutic avenue for PC by positioning MAOA as a stromal modulator of immune response as well as a target for combination immunotherapies. The current commentary aims to present our perspective on how a metabolic enzyme can change the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment, what we have learned, and what we can develop in the future.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Porcine-to-human islet xenotransplantation offers a promising solution to type 1 diabetes. This study investigates the use of Belimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits B cell activating factor (BAFF) as part of an immunosuppressive regimen in porcine-to-non-human primate xenotransplantation.


METHODS
Porcine islets were transplanted into Rhesus monkeys with an immunosuppressant regimen. Blood samples were collected from the monkeys pre- and post-treatment, and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to investigate immune cell landscape changes, focusing on B cells.


RESULTS
UMAP clustering of B cells identified five distinct subsets. Notably, Belimumab treatment significantly reduced the proportion of both CXCR5+ and CXCR5- atypical memory B cells, which possess the potential to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. Furthermore, differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed a comprehensive functional impairment, along with significant downregulation of activation markers such as CD69 and CD83, across all B cell subsets.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study elucidates the mechanism of action of Belimumab in non-human primate models, serving as preclinical subjects for B-cell-targeted therapy research in a xenotransplantation context. Significantly, our data indicate that Belimumab not only reduces the proportion of antibody-secreting atypical memory B cells but also induces functional impairment across all B cell subsets. Given the potential pathogenic roles of atypical memory B cells in autoimmunity and other related settings, their reduction by Belimumab could play a crucial role in regulating B-cell-mediated immune responses in pig-to-non-human primate pancreatic islet xenotransplantation. Thus, our findings highlight the prospective utility of Belimumab as a B cell suppressant in future clinical xenotransplantation applications.">

 Ovarian cancer (OvCa) remains largely refractory to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), owing to a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of patient tumors has revealed a TME enriched in immunosuppressive macrophages and characterized by exclusion of T cells from the tumor core, features strongly associated with ICB resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of this immune landscape remain poorly understood. To identify regulators of OvCa immunity, we employed Perturb-map, a first-of-its-kind spatial functional genomics platform that enables multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of candidate genes while preserving the spatial context of tumor–TME interactions in situ. We targeted 35 genes, prioritized through ligand–receptor interaction analysis of human OvCa scRNA-seq data, in an immunocompetent OvCa mouse model. Among these, IL-4 emerged as a key driver of ICB resistance. While IL-4 knockout did not affect tumor growth in untreated animals, it substantially remodeled the local TME and rendered tumors responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy. Unexpectedly, we found that both mouse and human ovarian cancer cells are a source of IL-4, a cytokine traditionally restricted to immune cells. Analysis of patient tumors revealed that tumor-associated macrophages exhibit a robust IL-4, induced transcriptional signature, implicating IL-4 in shaping the immunosuppressive TME in human disease, consistent with our preclinical findings (Cell, 2024). Furthermore, we observed that standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens, including carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cisplatin—induce a dose-dependent increase in IL-4 expression in both murine and human OvCa cell lines. This chemotherapy-induced IL-4 upregulation may contribute to immune evasion and recurrence following initial therapeutic response. Therapeutically, combined blockade of IL-4Rα and PD-1 significantly delayed tumor progression in vivo compared to monotherapy, suggesting that IL-4 signaling is both a necessary and targetable mechanism of immune resistance. These findings are clinically actionable, as Dupilumab, an FDA-approved anti-IL-4Rα antibody, is already in clinical use and well-tolerated. Our results uncover a previously unrecognized, chemotherapy-induced immunoregulatory axis in ovarian cancer and provide a strong rationale for therapeutic strategies that combine IL-4 pathway inhibition with ICB to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes.

 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represent opposing failures of immune regulation—tumor-driven suppression versus unchecked autoreactivity—yet both exploit the BAFF/APRIL–TACI (TNFRSF13B) axis. Continuous TACI engagement activates NF-κB signaling, promoting leukemic cell survival and rescuing autoreactive B cells from deletion. While therapies such as BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors shrink CLL tumors, they often impair immune competence; similarly, broad B-cell depletion in SLE curbs autoantibodies but heightens infection risk. A strategy that dismantles pathogenic B-cell programs while sparing protective immunity remains urgently needed.



 To assess whether genetic or antibody-mediated TACI blockade (i) suppresses CLL progression and restores anti-tumor immunity, and (ii) re-establishes self-tolerance across lupus models.



 Cancer arm: Eµ-TCL1 CLL cells, with or without TACI, were transplanted into wild-type mice (n ≥ 4/group); tumor burden, cytokines, and T-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Microarray and real-time PCR profiled the transcriptional impact of TACI loss. Primary human CLL samples (≥ 4) underwent migration assays, T-cell co-culture ± anti-TACI antibody, and CRISPR-mediated TACI knockdown before NSG mouse engraftment. Autoimmunity arm: TACI deletion was introduced into BAFF-Tg, Lyn-/-, and Sanroque mice (n ≥ 4/strain). Plasma-cell frequencies, germinal-center dynamics, Tfh activity, autoantibody titers, renal pathology, and serum cytokines were assessed. Safety endpoints included weight, hematology, and vaccine-response assays.



 TACI loss restrained pathogenic B-cell programs across both disease contexts. In CLL, mice engrafted with TACI-/- cells showed delayed disease progression, lower tumor incidence, normalized IL-6/IL-10 levels, and restored T-cell subsets versus TACI+/+ controls. TACI-deficient CLL cells downregulated IL-10, TNF, PD-L1, and PD-L2, restored immunoglobulin levels, and re-established T-cell–dependent antigen responses. Mechanistically, TACI enhanced CLL cell migration and splenic homing, promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment; findings were validated in primary CLL cells and PDX models. In lupus models, TACI deletion restored B-cell homeostasis. BAFF-Tg TACI-/- mice exhibited normal plasma-cell frequencies and reduced autoantibodies and IFN-γ. Lyn-/- TACI-/- mice showed fewer plasma cells, lower cytokine production, and preserved renal structure. Sanroque TACI-/- mice displayed corrected Tfh activity and normalized autoantibody levels. Protective immune responses were maintained across all models without overt immunodeficiency.



 TACI blockade restores immune balance by impairing leukemic B-cell survival and migration while preserving humoral responses. Simultaneously, it re-establishes tolerance and prevents end-organ damage in lupus. These findings support TACI inhibition as a cross-disease therapeutic strategy unifying cancer immunotherapy and autoimmunity control.

        <tr id="Liver transplantation remains the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD); however, immune rejection significantly hampers its long-term success. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes (DEXs) have emerged as a promising tool for inducing immune tolerance and enabling precise immunomodulation in liver transplantation, owing to their unique bidirectional immunoregulatory capabilities. This review systematically summarizes the biological characteristics and functional properties of DEXs, with a particular focus on their multidimensional regulatory mechanisms within the hepatic transplant immune microenvironment. These include: the mechanisms and pathways by which DEXs mediate immune tolerance; the synergistic immunoregulatory roles of DEXs and exosomes derived from other immune cells. Furthermore, we explore the potential of DEXs for integrated diagnostic and therapeutic applications, engineering upgrades to treatment strategies, and their prospects for clinical translation. Despite their promise, several challenges persist, including difficulties in exosome isolation and purification, prolonged preparation times, bioengineering limitations, and the lack of effective in vivo tracking methods. We propose that advancements in artificial intelligence, biomaterials science, and interdisciplinary technologies may help overcome these barriers, facilitating the precise isolation, functional optimization, and clinical translation of DEXs. This review emphasizes the molecular immunoregulatory networks governed by DEXs and discusses their translational pathways, aiming to promote individualized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in liver transplantation.">

        <tr id="Tumor driven immune suppression poses a significant impediment to the success of immunotherapy in ovarian cancer. Among the various mechanisms contributing to immune suppression, intracellular communication facilitated by tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) within the tumor microenvironment emerges as a pivotal factor influencing tumor growth. Here, it is demonstrated that extracellular vesicle-packaged eIF4E from tumor cells alters protein translation in macrophages, contributing to antitumor immune response. Mechanistically, tumor derived EV-packaged eIF4E significantly enhances the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), driving the synthesis and secretion of cholesterol. This, in turn, activates macrophages and causes immunosuppression through the X-box binding protein 1 and Programmed death-ligand 1 (XBP1/PD-L1) axis. Strikingly, both genetic and pharmacological depletion of HMGCR in macrophages effectively restores their antitumor activity. Clinically, elevated HMGCR expression in tumor-associated macrophages is associated with poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. The pivotal role of eIF4E is underscored here as a key signaling mediator, facilitating the communication between tumor and immune cells via EVs to promote immune suppression and suggesting HMGCR as a potential therapeutic target for tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are essential components of the innate immune system, functioning as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In hematological malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), TLRs influence inflammation, disease progression, and therapeutic response. This review highlights the prognostic relevance of TLR expression, the role of the MyD88 signaling pathway in clonal evolution, and the dual nature of TLR‐mediated immune responses, either promoting antitumor activity or contributing to leukemogenesis. Notably, TLR dysregulation in MDS and AML is associated with poor prognosis and genomic instability, whereas in CML, TLRs contribute to a protective microenvironment via NOD‐like and TNF‐α pathways. Therapeutic strategies targeting TLRs, including agonists and antagonists, show promise in enhancing antitumor responses, especially when combined with agents like purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors. Furthermore, genetic variations in TLR pathways may influence individual susceptibility to infection and cancer progression, reinforcing the relevance of personalized medicine. Overall, this review underscores the need for continued research into TLR modulation as a foundation for innovative therapies in hematologic cancers.">

        <tr id="Background Advancing research in oncology highlights the inverse correlation between antibiotic treatment and the positive outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) administration, confirming once more the importance of microbiota and microbiota-derived compounds as complementary tools for treating cancer. Among the immune checkpoints, the CD200 cell surface glycoprotein has gained attention for its role in promoting self-tolerance and potentially facilitating tumor growth through interaction with the CD200R1 receptor. Methods We developed a robust AlphaLISA-based screening to identify human gut microbiota-derived proteins that may interact with CD200R1 and screened a library of 10,966 gut bacterial proteins. The antitumor activity of BOC1 was investigated in vitro by cytokine analysis, mixed lymphocyte reactions, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)–T-cell suppression assay. AlphaFold modeling was used to predict potential interaction points between BOC1 and CD200R1. Results We successfully identified BOC1, a protein from the Bacteroides genus, showing better affinity than the natural ligand, CD200, toward the CD200R1 receptor. BOC1 induces cytokine secretion by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and enhances CD8+/CD4+ T-cell populations and IFNγ production, highlighting its potent immunostimulatory properties. BOC1 also negatively impacts the differentiation of MDSCs, maintaining an immature monocytic profile (high CD14 and HLA-DR expression) and restoring T-cell proliferation even at low (10 nM) concentration. Mutation of amino acids within the N-terminal region of BOC1 reduces binding to CD200R1, supporting the importance of this region for a possible interaction with CD200R1. Conclusion The immunostimulatory properties of BOC1 observed in vitro are compatible with an ICI-like behavior of this bacterial protein. Given that neither the CD200 protein nor the anti-CD200 antibody is able to compete with BOC1 for binding to CD200R1, and as supported by AlphaFold modeling predictions, CD200 and BOC1 might target different regions of CD200R1.">

        <tr id="Obesity is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation and, paradoxically, is also associated with immune cells dysfunction. In this study, we analyzed peripheral blood Invariant Natural killer T cells (iNKT) in individuals with or without obesity. These unconventional T cells recognize lipid antigens presented by the monomorphic CD1d MHC I-like protein. We demonstrated an activation of iNKT cells in individuals with obesity associated with both increased apoptosis and dysfunction as assessed by the lack of responsiveness to PMA/Ionomycin stimulation. This disruption mainly affects the CD4− subset, more dedicated to pro-inflammatory cytokines release and cytotoxicity. Such impact could therefore be involved in the loss of immunosurveillance observed in obesity. Interestingly, CD1d is upregulated on intermediate and non-classical monocytes from individuals with obesity and its expression on both monocyte subsets is correlated with iNKT cell dysfunction. Both the activation and hypo-responsiveness of iNKT cells as well as CD1d modulation on monocytes are significantly reversed after bariatric surgery. Altogether, these data suggest that increased CD1d expression may enhance the presentation of endogenous lipid antigens, thereby contributing to iNKT cell activation in the context of obesity.">

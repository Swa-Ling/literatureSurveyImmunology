        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play pivotal roles in modulating therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. While B cells have traditionally been viewed as bystanders in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests they may actively influence anti-tumor immunity, albeit with conflicting reports regarding their pro-tumor or anti-tumor roles. This study explores the crucial roles played by B cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping melanoma responses to ICB therapy. We show a significant enrichment of B cells in ICB therapy responders compared to non-responders, pre-treatment, through retrospective analyses of melanoma patient tumors. Functional assays demonstrate that B cell depletion impairs T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, underscoring the importance of B cells in anti-tumor responses. To investigate the clinical relevance, EVs were isolated from melanoma patient tumors, and fractioned into tumor and immune subpopulations. MiRNA profiling of CD19+ EVs identifies miR-99a-5p as a top candidate, among several others, upregulated in responders. Functional assays show that miR-99a-5p silencing in B cells diminishes T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity, suggesting its role in promoting B cell-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p influences B cell maturation within the TME by mediating class-switch recombination. Our findings highlight the important role of B cells and their derived EVs in shaping the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell-related pathways.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR-T cell treatment remains incompletely understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analyses of bone marrow-resident immune cells from B-ALL patients before and after CAR T-cell treatment. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation, including an increase in myeloid cells. Significant induction of the IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells. PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response in the cohort of patients analyzed. Further, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell dysfunction. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells led to increased accumulation of human MDSCs, exacerbation of a hypoxic environment and T-cell exhaustion in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. In conclusion, CAR T-cell-mediated myeloid activation is associated with pathways of immune dysregulation that may antagonize the effects of therapy. Key points The tumor immune context post-treatment affects CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling result in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromise CAR T-cell efficacy.">

        <tr id="Monocytes are essential for replenishing homeostatic macrophages in the intestine. However, they also accumulate in significant numbers when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The molecular pathways governing monocyte behaviour across these different contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of monocytes that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs). These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate increased expression of IBD susceptibility genes. By performing cross-species analysis, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis in mice. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete precursor in the bone marrow (BM) and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans. Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production. Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health.">

        <tr id="HIV causes intense polyclonal activation of B cells, resulting in increased numbers of spontaneously antibody-secreting cells in the circulation and hypergammaglobulinemia. It is accompanied by significant perturbations in various B cell subsets, such as increased frequencies of immature/transitional B cells, activated memory B cells, atypical memory B cells, short-lived plasmablasts and regulatory B cells, as well as by decreased frequencies of resting memory and resting naïve B cells. Furthermore, both memory and antigen-inexperienced naïve B cells show exhausted and immune-senescent phenotypes. HIV also drives the expansion and functional impairment of CD4+ T follicular helper cells, which provide help to B cells, crucial for the generation of germinal center reactions and production of long-lived plasma and memory B cells. By suppressing viral replication, anti-retroviral therapy reverses the virus-induced perturbations and functional defects, albeit inadequately. Due to HIV’s lingering impact on B cells, immune senescence and residual chronic inflammation, people with HIV (PWH), especially immune non-responders, are immunocompromised and mount suboptimal antibody responses to vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review how functionally and phenotypically distinct B cell subsets are induced in response to a vaccine and an infection and how HIV infection and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) impact them. We also review the role played by HIV-induced defects and perturbations in B cells in the induction of humoral immune responses to currently used anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in PWH on ART. We also outline different strategies that could potentially enhance the vaccine-induced antibody responses in PWH. The review will provide guidance and impetus for further research to improve the immunogenicity of these vaccines in this human population.">

        <tr id="Resistance to immunotherapy is a cardinal feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Inhibition of Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO), a post-translational modification with important immune regulatory functions, augments responsiveness to immunotherapy in non-PDAC models via pro-immunogenic effects on myeloid cells, cancer cells, and T-cells. Recently, it has been reported that SUMO inhibition has direct immunogenic effects on PDAC. Here, we report that the novel combination of SUMO inhibition with a small molecule, TAK-981, plus antibody-mediated CD40 agonism improves survival in an aggressive orthotopic mouse model of PDAC by enhancing anti-tumoral immunogenicity. This combination amplifies CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration and induces significant changes among macrophages. TAK-981 also leads to enhanced cancer specific MHC-I expression both in vitro and in vivo by augmenting interferon signaling. We show that the improvement in survival is mediated by macrophages. Our findings show that SUMO inhibition complements CD40 agonism to enhance immune activity in PDAC via interferon signaling, improving survival in an aggressive pre-clinical model of PDAC and translating previous findings to a characteristically immunosuppressive and highly aggressive solid malignancy.">

Our data confirms that targeting mouse orthotopic PDAC tumors with IR together with CCR5 inhibition and PD1 blockade reduces E-cadherin positive tumor cells by recruiting a hypoactive NKG2D-ve NK population, phenotypically reminiscent of trNK cells, that supports CD8 T-cell involvement. We show an equivalent population in human single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) PDAC cohorts that represents immunomodulatory trNK cells that could similarly support CD8 T-cell levels in a cDC1-dependent manner. Importantly, a trNK signature associates with survival in PDAC and other solid malignancies revealing a potential beneficial role for trNK in improving adaptive anti-tumor responses and supporting CCR5 inhibitor (CCR5i)/αPD1 and IR-induced damage as a novel therapeutic approach.">

        <tr id="Recent models of infection and experimental inflammation reveal that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can generate a memory of the exposure that heightens the response to subsequent stimulation, a process termed central trained immunity. Inflammation is also a constitutive feature of cancer, including hematologic malignancies. Here, we adapt a translationally relevant model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to determine if inflammation in the bone marrow (BM) niche durably reprograms resident healthy HSPCs. To simulate the onset of malignancy along with the associated inflammatory surge as well as the subsequent remission, we generated hematopoietic chimera with healthy HSPCs and HSPCs bearing a doxycycline-responsive oncogene (hMLL-AF9) expression cassette, a validated model of AML. Results show that the exposure to AML blasts in the BM leaves healthy HSPCs during experimental remission with broad transcriptomic, epigenetic changes and enhanced reliance on glycolysis. A heterologous secondary challenge of AML-experienced animals resulted in pronounced gene expression changes in inflammatory and metabolic pathways. These augmented responses coincided with altered chromatin accessibility in AML-experienced HSPCs. Motif analysis of the epigenome in AML trained HSPC points to the involvement of core hematopoietic transcription factors. Altogether, these observations provide first evidence for the durable inflammatory reprogramming of healthy HSPCs in the cancer microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by unremitting immune attack on pancreas insulin-producing beta cells. Persistence of the autoimmune response is mediated by TCF1+ Ly108+ progenitor CD8+ T (Tprog) cells, a stem-like population that gives rise to exhausted effectors with limited cytolytic function in chronic virus infection and cancer. What paradoxically drives Tprog conversion to highly cytolytic effectors in T1D, however, remains unclear. Here, we show that the epigenetic regulator UTX controls diabetogenic CD8+ Tprog differentiation by poising chromatin for transition to a cytolytic effector state. Indeed, deletion of UTX function in T cells impairs conversion of Tprog to autoimmune effectors and protects mice from spontaneous diabetes, as well as an aggressive form of autoimmune diabetes induced by anti-PD1 cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, short-term treatment with UTX inhibitor GSKJ4 similarly protects from T1D, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting UTX-mediated mechanisms to break unremitting autoimmune responses.">

 Background: Siglec-15 (Sig15) has emerged as a putative immune checkpoint, highly expressed in several solid and hematological malignancies, including B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Knockout (KO) of Siglec15 in murine B-ALL models has been shown to promote leukemia clearance in immunocompetent recipients while the disease progresses lethally in immunodeficient recipients, suggesting that Sig15 KO restores T effector function and is a promising immunotherapy target. Through our study, we aim to elucidate the impact of Sig15 expression on the immune response in B-ALL and its potential as a therapeutic target.
 Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on paired spleen (N=12) and bone marrow samples (N=12) from immunocompetent and immunodeficient (Rag1-/-) C57BL/6 mice engrafted with wild-type (WT) or Sig15 KO murine B-ALL cell lines. Following genomic alignment, QC, batch correction, and clustering, the resulting single-cell dataset comprised 262,702 cells forming 80 clusters, representing malignant cells and immune subpopulations spanning myeloid and lymphoid lineages in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen.
 Results: ScRNA-seq analysis revealed a trend in increasing proportions of T cells, NK cells, and mature neutrophils in the BM of Sig15 KO mice compared to their WT B-ALL counterparts. Specifically, within the BM lymphoid compartment, a rise in naïve and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell subpopulations was observed, along with the differentiation of effector memory T cells and a shift in NK cells from an activated to resting state. This phenotypic shift to a resting state in NK cells has been previously associated with poor outcomes in B-ALL, prompting us to examine the survival association of resting versus activated NK gene signatures using the publicly available TARGET phase 2 B-ALL dataset. The survival analysis illustrated that an increased activated NK cell signature in the BM or peripheral blood was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P < 0.05), while an enrichment of resting NK cell signature was conversely associated with improved overall survival (P < 0.05). We further validated these findings with an external B-ALL single-cell dataset derived from human BM samples, demonstrating that increased resting versus activated NK cells were linked to remission relative to relapse. Within the BM myeloid compartment, Sig15 KO led to the abrogation of emergency myelopoiesis observed in the recipients of WT B-ALL, exhibiting a shift toward mature neutrophils. Furthermore, mature neutrophils in the BM of recipients of Sig15 KO B-ALL displayed an anti-tumoral N1 neutrophil phenotype compared to an N2 pro-tumoral phenotype observed in WT B-ALL mice. Notably, the enrichment of this N1 neutrophil signature in the TARGET phase 2 B-ALL cohort was associated with improved survival (P < 0.05). Comparing these findings to the immune profile of the spleen revealed similar patterns with an increase in circulating cytotoxic T cells and T follicular helper costimulation, along with a shift toward a resting NK cell state and mature N1 neutrophils. Lastly, to examine how immune subpopulations interact following Sig15 KO, we performed intercellular communication analysis. Our results showed that Sig15 KO in leukemia cells promotes a pro-inflammatory immune microenvironment with increased pro-inflammatory signaling between subpopulations, including classical monocyte-mediated IL-1 signaling to N1 neutrophils and cytotoxic T cells, as well as increased CCL6 and IL-16 signaling.
 Conclusion: Our study identifies leukemia-expressed Sig15 as a pivotal regulator of the immune landscape in B-ALL, with its knockout promoting pro-inflammatory antitumoral immune responses and an association with improved patient outcomes. These insights underscore the potential of targeting Sig15 in hematologic malignancies to enhance antitumor immunity and improve patient outcomes.

We observed reduced expression of genes related to effector and cytotoxic T-cell functions across conventional, unconventional, and regulatory T-cell subsets in diabetic children, particularly at the time of diagnosis. These findings were supported by flow cytometry analysis of the same cohort and by reanalysis of publicly available data. Overall, our results suggest that T1D is associated with impaired T-cell effector differentiation, which may contribute to immune dysregulation and loss of self-tolerance.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

 Richter syndrome (RS) displays dismal prognosis and remains largely refractory to most existing therapies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and bi-specific antibodies have shown promising activity, yet determinants of response and resistance to these immunotherapies remain incompletely understood. We leveraged our previously developed mouse models of RS, achieved via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of combinatorial loss-of-function drivers in immune competent mice, to interrogate microenvironmental determinants of disease transformation and response to therapy.
 We profiled immune cells from the spleen of 18 primary murine tumors displaying either CLL (n=4), CLL/RS (n=3) or RS (n=11) histology by sc-RNAseq. Analysis of a total of 104,731 T/NK cells revealed pronounced changes in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartment, with CD8+ effector/exhausted T cells and CD4+ cytotoxic cells as the predominant subsets in RS compared to CLL (pAdj<0.038). Flow cytometric analysis of an independent set of 17 cases (5 CLL, 3 CLL/RS, 9 RS) confirmed increased CD8/CD4 T cell ratio as typical of RS (p=0.008), together with abundant effector/memory CD8+ T cell subsets expressing high PD-1 and TOX levels (p=0.001). Enrichment in cytotoxic/exhausted CD8+ T cells in RS was validated in bulk external RNA-seq data from 34 human RS lymph node (LN) samples and 34 CLL-LNs using a gene score based on human orthologs of 13 genes derived from the mouse data (p=0.0023). Importantly, ex vivo stimulation of murine splenocytes (5 CLL, 6 RS) with PMA/ionomycin showed marked secretion of IFNg, TNFa and Granzyme B in PD-1+ CD8+ T cells from RS cases (p<0.02 for all combinations). In contrast, CLL CD8+ PD-1+ T cells only showed induction of TNFa. TCR-seq revealed pronounced clonal expansion in RS compared to CLL (Shannon index p=0.008), indicative of chronic antigenic stimulation in RS.
 The myeloid/monocytic compartment (41,956 cells) displayed more stability at transformation, aside from new enrichment of CXCL9+/CXCL10+ macrophages in RS compared to CLL (pAdj=0.093). This population displayed features of inflammatory M1 cells, including high expression of H2-Ab1 (class II), Cd274 (PD-L1), Cd40, Stat1, and Cd86. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed increased abundance of CXCL9+ macrophages in splenic preparations from RS compared to CLL mice (p= 0.007), and signatures extracted from CXCL9+ macrophages were validated as enriched in bulk RNA-seq from human RS cohorts (p<0.0001). Importantly, proportional levels of CXCL9+ macrophages correlated with those of CD8+ exhausted T cells (Pearson r= 0.69, p<0.0001). Numerous related ligand-receptor pairs, including PD-1/PD-L1, were significantly enriched in RS compared to CLL per the Liana algorithm. Physical proximity of IFNG, GZMB, and CD3D expressing cells, representing cytotoxic T cells, to CXCL9 and CD68 expressing cells, representing CXCL9/10+ macrophages (Moran's R > 0.1), was evident in one RS-LN analyzed by 10X Visium.
 To interrogate determinants of response/resistance to ICB therapy, we treated 4 different RS tumor models (achieved by transplantation of RS primary tumors into syngeneic immune competent recipients) and one CLL for 3 weeks with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (or isotype control) and analyzed changes in immune microenvironmental features at the end of treatment by combined scRNA-seq and flow cytometry. While CLL transplants remained insensitive to therapy, we observed a range of responses in the RS models, from non-response (1 line) to partial response (1 line) to marked response to treatment (2 lines). Importantly, responding cases showed lower tumor burden in spleen at euthanasia, higher PD-1 or PD-L1 tumor expression before treatment (p<0.001), and increased baseline (or post-treatment) polyfunctionality of CD8+ PD-1+ T cells. Complete tumor regression in one of the RS lines was accompanied by loss of CXCL9+ macrophages (p=0.001) and CD8+ PD-1+ T cells (p=0.0002), suggesting that tumor-intrinsic features favor retention of these subpopulations prior to therapy.
 Overall, these data suggest key changes in immune microenvironmental features of RS compared to CLL, which associate to response to ICB in mice. Analysis of spatial datasets from LN of RS patients treated with ICB is ongoing to evaluate whether these features associate to response in humans, together with further investigation of their relevance to outcome through in vivo depletion experiments.

We previously showed, in immunodeficient context, that antimitotic chemotherapy induced cGAS/STING pathway amplifying antitumor response through a paracrine IFN-1 secretome. We herein studied tumor progression and response to treatment using an immunocompetent murine model. scRNAseq analysis revealed that paclitaxel treatment altered tumor cell phenotypes, favoring tumor cells with a gene expression signature indicative of active NF-κB pathway with secretory phenotype. Treatment coincidently reduced IFN-I signature cells during tumor progression. The resulting secretory shift correlated with neutrophil recruitment to the tumor, particularly CXCR2+ neutrophils, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 receptor by navarixin reactivated antitumor immunity, enhancing NK cell infiltration and tumor cytotoxicity. Navarixin combination with paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor volume and metastasis. Targeting the NF-κB-driven secretory phenotype, in particular through neutrophil modulation, holds promise for improving TNBC treatment outcomes.">

While the immune system is known to help regulate tissue damage, immune mechanisms involved in RT-induced intestinal toxicity are not fully understood. Following CT-guided localised intestinal irradiation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry revealed RT-induced chemokine-dependent recruitment of innate immune cells. Deletion of C-C chemokine receptor (Ccr)1, Ccr2, Ccr3 and Ccr5, blocked recruitment and worsened radiation induced toxicities, suggesting an important role for an innate immune cell population in limiting RT-mediated bowel damage. Furthermore, CCR2-deficient mice showed exacerbated weight loss and intestinal permeability, while the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes alleviated symptoms. Mechanistically, IL-17 cytokine production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a critical factor in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, was found to be reduced in irradiated CCR2−/−, however the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes resulted in increased IL-17 levels.

        <tr id="Relapse due to antigen escape is a major cause of treatment failure for patients with B-cell malignancies following targeted immunotherapies, including CD19- and CD22-directed chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells. To identify tumor intrinsic factors associated with antigen loss, we performed single-cell analyses on 61 primary patient samples or patient-derived xenografts from patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated with CAR T cells. We identified that low levels of the transcription factor IKAROS in pro-B-like B-ALL cells before CAR T treatment are associated with antigen escape. We demonstrate that IKAROSlow B-ALL cells lose features of B cell identity and resemble progenitor cells based on their epigenetic and transcriptional state, resulting in the downregulation of B-cell immunotherapy antigens, including surface expression of CD19 and CD22. We find that modulation of CD19 and CD22 protein expression is IKAROS dose-dependent and reversible. Further, we demonstrate that IKAROSlow cells are resistant to CD19- and CD22-targeted therapies. Together, we describe a novel role for IKAROS in the regulation of B-cell immunotherapy targets and the risk of antigen escape relapse, identifying it as a potential prognostic target. Highlights IKAROSlow pro-B-like B-ALL cells are associated with CD19neg relapse IKAROSlow B-ALL cells resemble progenitor cells and have lower B-cell commitment IKAROS modulates CD19 and CD22 surface expression in a dose-dependent and reversible manner IKAROSlow B-ALL cells are more resistant to CD19- and CD22-targeted therapies Graphical abstract Before immunotherapy, IKAROSlow pro-B-like B-ALL cells possess chromatin and gene expression states poised for loss of B-cell identity while maintaining expression of CD19 and CD22. Under immune pressure, IKAROShigh cells maintain their antigen expression, making them more susceptible to T cell-mediated killing. Conversely, IKAROSlow cells are more likely to downregulate their antigen expression, giving them a relative advantage to escape immunotherapies, resulting in antigen escape relapse.">

        <tr id="Macrophages hold tremendous promise as effectors of cancer immunotherapy, but the best strategies to provoke these cells to attack tumors remain unknown. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting two distinct macrophage immune checkpoints: CD47 and CD24. We found that antibodies targeting these antigens could elicit maximal levels of phagocytosis when combined together in vitro. However, to our surprise, via unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screens, we found that CD24 primarily acts as a target of opsonization rather than an immune checkpoint. In a series of in vitro and in vivo genetic validation studies, we found that CD24 was neither necessary nor sufficient to protect cancer cells from macrophage phagocytosis in most mouse and human tumor models. Instead, anti-CD24 antibodies exhibit robust Fc-dependent activity, and as a consequence, they cause significant on-target hematologic toxicity in mice. To overcome these challenges and leverage our findings for therapeutic purposes, we engineered a collection of 77 novel bispecific antibodies that bind to a tumor antigen with one arm and engage macrophages with the second arm. We discovered multiple novel bispecifics that maximally activate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and reduce binding to healthy blood cells, including bispecifics targeting macrophage immune checkpoint molecules in combination with EGFR, TROP2, and CD71. Overall, our findings indicate that CD47 predominates over CD24 as a macrophage immune checkpoint in cancer, and that the novel bispecifics we created may be optimal immunotherapies to direct myeloid cells to eradicate solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has emerged as a powerful immune therapy for various diseases. Our studies in humanized mice and non-human primates (NHPs) demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) modified with anti-HIV CAR leads to lifelong engraftment and supply of functional anti-viral CAR-T cells, leading to significantly reduced viral rebound after ART withdrawal. However, T cell exhaustion, driven by chronic immune activation, remains a major challenge for the continuous efficacy of CAR-T therapy, necessitating additional measures to achieve functional cure. We recently showed that in vivo treatment with low dose rapamycin reduced chronic inflammation and improved anti-HIV T cell function in HIV-infected humanized mice. Here, we report that rapamycin significantly improved CAR-T cell function both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with rapamycin improved CAR-T cell mitochondria respiration and cytotoxicity. In vivo treatment with low-dose rapamycin in HIV-infected, CAR-HSC treated mice reduced chronic inflammation, prevented exhaustion of CAR-T cells and improved CAR-T control of viral replication compared to CAR-HSCs treatment alone. RNAseq analysis of sorted CAR-T cells from humanized mice showed that rapamycin significantly modified the CAR-T cell transcriptome, including the downregulation of multiple check point inhibitors and the upregulation of key genes related to cell survival. We also observed significantly delayed viral rebound after ART withdrawal and diminished HIV reservoir in mice that were treated with rapamycin and CAR-HSCs as compared to CAR-HSCs treatment alone.

 Introduction
 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, a substantial proportion of patients remain refractory or relapse with suboptimal CAR T cell activity. The contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR T cells remains incompletely understood. We hypothesized that the bone marrow (BM) immunological niche reacts to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation by activating inhibitory pathways and molecules. To verify this hypothesis, we performed a transcriptional analysis of CAR T cells and the BM microenvironment from treated patients and validated findings by flow cytometry.
 Methods
 Our group developed anti-CD19 CAR T cells generated with the non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon vector from donor T cells in patients relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Magnani CF et al, J Clin Invest. 2020 Nov 2; 130(11): 6021-6033). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analysis of BM-resident immune cells from patients with B-ALL. Data in this study were generated from patients enrolled in the FT01CARCIK Phase I/IIb clinical trial (NCT03389035), in the FT03CARCIK Phase II study (NCT05252403) or who received autologous CAR T cells as part of a Phase I/II trial or commercial cell therapy. Mechanistic insights into the pathways and molecules involved were validated in tumor-bearing humanized mice.
 Results
 We analyzed hematological laboratory parameters from patients after treatment and we found that CAR T cells elicit a bystander activation of endogenous immune cells, involving both innate and adaptive immunity, which is actively regulated by a process of immune regulation. To elucidate the cellular and molecular mediators involved in dampening CAR T-cell-mediated immune activation, we performed scRNA-seq of BM samples collected at early time points after treatment (1-2 months). Eighteen sequencing libraries were analyzed, for a total of 71407 high-quality cells. Unbiased clustering of BM cells and infusion products was performed by UMAP embedding. More representative clusters were classified into infusion product, endogenous CD4 and CD8 population, B cells, myeloid cells, pDC, NK, and NK-T cells. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T-cell-mediated inflammation, and an increase in myeloid cells. Significant enrichment in IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells, findings validated with a cohort of additional 20 matched BM samples pre- and post-CAR T-cell treatment acquired using spectral flow cytometry. By modeling intercellular communications, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell exhaustion, and affecting both CAR T cells and endogenous T cells. Moreover, infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells leads to increased accumulation of human MDSCs and exacerbation of a hypoxic environment in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. Finally, we also assessed the role of tumor microenvironmental factors on the duration of response (DOR) and found that PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response.
 Conclusions
 This study highlights the critical role of the tumor microenvironment on CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-ALL. We demonstrate that IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β signaling lead to general immune suppression after treatment, resulting in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromising CAR T-cell efficacy.

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition caused by altered cytokine signaling, maladaptive immunity, dysbiosis, and intestinal barrier dysfunction. Patients with IBD receive therapy to correct these imbalances and achieve remission. However, most patients relapse, suggesting that pathological mechanisms persist during remission. Here, we show that excess epithelial cell death is an underlying feature of IBD that arises in patients in remission and on advanced therapy. Mechanistically, nascent inflammation reprograms epithelial cells into a macrophage-like state that promotes RIPK1-independent necroptotic signaling, then triggers iNOS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis of absorptive epithelial cells and PUMA-mediated intestinal stem cell death. These findings reveal aberrant epithelial cell death signaling as a hallmark of IBD that occurs early in mucosal lesion development and persists despite current therapeutic approaches.

        <tr id="Immune exclusion inhibits anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy, but its mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (TROP2), a key target of emerging anti-cancer Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), controls barrier-mediated immune exclusion in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) through Claudin 7 association and tight junction regulation. TROP2 expression is inversely correlated with T cell infiltration and strongly associated with outcomes in TNBC. Loss-of-function and reconstitution experiments demonstrate TROP2 is sufficient to drive tumor progression in vivo in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner, while its loss deregulates expression and localization of multiple tight junction proteins, enabling T cell infiltration. Employing a humanized TROP2 syngeneic TNBC model, we show that TROP2 targeting via hRS7, the antibody component of Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), enhances the anti-PD1 response associated with improved T cell accessibility and effector function. Correspondingly, TROP2 expression is highly associated with lack of response to anti-PD1 therapy in human breast cancer. Thus, TROP2 controls an immune exclusion program that can be targeted to enhance immunotherapy response. Synopsis This study defines a new mechanism of barrier-mediated immune exclusion in cancer controlled by TROP2-dependent tight junctions.

        <tr id="T lymphocytes play a major role in intestinal homeostasis, with a particular impact on the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In Crohn’s disease (CD) patients, the intestinal mucosa is inflamed, epithelium permeability is increased, and IECs present compositional and functional defects. The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location. We show that while in homeostatic context T cells support the proliferation and differentiation balance of organoids, mucosal T lymphocytes from CD patients present a high cytotoxicity against IECs. Importantly, this cytotoxicity is a persistent defect overtime in culture. Organoids also show defective intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation and morphological changes. Single cell RNA sequencing after coculture highlights a general response of T cells to the epithelial microenvironment, and more particularly, an increase activation of a pro-inflammatory CD8+ T cells effector population in CD patients compared to controls.

        <tr id="Background: Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated efficacy in treating advanced cancers, their therapeutic success remains limited for many patients, with initial responders often experiencing resistance and relapse. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a powerful cytokine for antitumor immunotherapy, enhancing both lymphocyte recruitment into tumors and immune cell activation. Methods: In this study, we successfully produced mouse interleukin-12 (mIL12) through eukaryotic recombinant expression. In vivo, mIL12 exhibited significant control of tumor immunity in ICI-resistant and aggressive tumor models. Further mechanistic analysis indicated that treatment with mIL12 led to a substantial increase in tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T, CD8+ T, cDC1, and CD103+ cDC1 cells. Results: Our data underscore the potential of a combined therapeutic strategy involving IL-12 with PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade to elicit a potent antitumor immune response. Notably, the co-administration of mIL12 and PD-1 blockade significantly enhanced the presence of central memory T cells (TCM) within tumors. Conclusions: This study is the first to provide evidence that the combination of mIL12 and PD-1 blockers promotes the generation of TCM, potentially contributing to a robust and durable antitumor effect.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

        <tr id="Japanese encephalitis (JE), caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease and a leading cause of viral encephalitis worldwide. While JEV has the ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the precise mechanisms by which it inhibits the immune response prior to penetrating the BBB remain unclear, presenting obstacles in the development of efficacious therapeutic interventions. This study investigated the impact of JEV on CD8+ T cell responses, with a particular focus on the dysfunction of CD8+ T cells during JEV infection. Our results demonstrated that JEV infection significantly elevated the expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells, which are markers of T cell exhaustion, leading to inhibited function and impaired differentiation, resulting in a poorer prognosis in mice. Compared with nondiseased mice, symptomatic mice presented a greater proportion of exhaustion-like CD8+ T cells. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that MDSCs induced an exhaustion-like state in CD8+ T cells, characterized by significant upregulation of PD-1 and TIM-3 expression. Notably, blocking TIM-3 or depleting MDSCs restored CD8+ T cell functionality by rescuing the expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Furthermore, the depletion of MDSCs not only alleviated T cell exhaustion-like phenotypes but also improved survival rates in JEV-infected mice. These findings suggest that JEV promotes immune evasion through MDSC-induced CD8+ T cell exhaustion-like states and identify TIM-3 as a promising therapeutic target for JE treatment.">

 Multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable hematologic malignancy, presents significant challenges in managing its recurrence. The bone marrow tumor microenvironment (BM-TME) is critical to MM progression. However, classical immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, like anti-PD1, have shown limited efficacy in MM. Therefore, elucidating the compositional features and regulatory mechanisms of the TIME in MM is crucial for developing novel immunotherapeutic targets. Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TRMs) reside indefinitely at multiple anatomical locations like the skin, intestine, and bone marrow, functioning as frontline responders against reencountered pathogens and tumors. Whether CD8+ TRMs within BM-TME are involved in the MM cell immune escape and pathogenesis has not been systematically elucidated.
 Firstly, we leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the BM CD8+ T cells across patients at different stages of MM, and identify that CD69+CD8+ T subsets were BM residents, and the proportion of BM CD8+ TRMs between health donors and MM patients was comparable. Moreover, our findings indicated that BM CD8+ TRMs exhibit exhausted features and enrichment of NK genes with MM progresses. Importantly, we observed a considerable elevation of the NK gene KLRB1 and its encoded protein CD161 in BM CD8+ TRMs in MM patients. Immunofluorescence labeling of BM biopsy samples from MM patients confirmed the infiltration of the BM-TME with CD3+CD8+CD69+CD161+ cells.
 Then, we found that KLRB1 expression in BM CD8+ TRMs was higher than that of other classical inhibitory receptor genes (e.g., PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3), and CLEC2D (encodes the ligand of CD161) was also markedly expressed in patients' MM cells, exhibiting considerably higher than classical immunosuppressive receptor ligand genes (e.g., PDL1, CD80, CD86). Moreover, patients with higher CLEC2D expression had unfavorable overall survival.
 We further found that the CD161 expression was higher in CD69+CD8+ TRMs compared to circulating CD69-CD8+ T cells, and the percentage of BM CD161+CD8+ TRMs in MM patients was significantly higher than in healthy donors, while there was no difference for PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3 expression. Notably, only a small fraction of BM CD8+ TRMs have mucosal-associated invariant T cell phenotypes (identified by CD161+TCR-Vα7.2+). Additionally, the CLEC2D expression of BM cells was analyzed, and the highest level of CLEC2D expression was observed in B cells from MM patients, followed by plasma cells. Importantly, CLEC2D expression in MM patients was significantly higher than in plasma cells from healthy donors. Next, to investigate whether the blockade of CD161 could restore the function of CD8+ TRMs, the primary BM cells from MM patients were isolated and stimulated ex vivo. Compared to the anti-PD-1 and isotype group, CD161 blocking presents enhanced CD8+ TRMs proliferation and cytokine secretion levels (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL2), increasing MM cells apoptosis.
 Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has achieved impressive success in treating relapsed/refractory MM. How to prevent CAR-T cell exhaustion and enhance function remains a significant challenge. Therefore, we next set out to investigate the impact of CD161 on CAR-T cells. Our results demonstrated that CD161 was highly expressed in early peripheral blood (PB) CAR-T cells after infusion in MM patients but decreased with time. Moreover, the CD161 expression of CAR-T cells was considerably higher than endogenous T cells. Notably, BM-derived CAR-T cells have higher CD161 expression than PB counterparts for the same patient, suggesting CD161 may have BM-specific expression enrichment. After co-culturing MM and CAR-T cells in vitro for 24 hours, we found that blocking CD161 led to an augmented proportion of CAR-T cells, increased IFN-γ secretion, and a notable elevation in tumor cell apoptosis compared to the anti-PD-1 and isotype groups.
 Taken together, we demonstrated that CD8+ TRMs constitute a vital anti-tumor cell subset in the MM BM-TME, which exhibits a high expression of the inhibitory CD161 receptor, binding to the CLEC2D expressed by MM cells, thereby mediating the dysfunction of CD8+ TRMs. Blocking the CD161-CLEC2D pathway is expected to become a novel target for MM immunotherapy. The combination of CD161 inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy can potentially enhance the anti-myeloma function of CAR-T cells.

 Background:
 Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is an indolent B-cell malignancy for which there is currently no cure. The underlying molecular mechanisms and the impact of the immunosuppressive microenvironment on WM oncogenesis remain still incompletely understood.
 Methods:
 We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing combined with BCR and TCR sequencing to analyze bone marrow samples from 7 healthy donors (HD) and 26 newly diagnosed WM patients. In vitro experiments were performed using antibodies to validate the function of the novel WM biomarker CD35 in BCWM.1 and MWCL-1 cell lines.
 Results:
 Our findings highlighted significant differences in the immune microenvironment between WM patients and healthy donors. In WM patients, we observed a marked reduction in CD8+ naïve T cells and an increase in CD8+ effector T cells compared to healthy donors. Monocyte proportions were also lower in WM patients. Several stages of normal B cells, including pre-B cells, naïve B cells, and memory B cells, were significantly reduced in WM patients. Notably, clonal B cells were predominantly found in CXCR4mut patients, while clonal plasma cells were more common in CXCR4wt patients.
 We employed non-negative matrix factorization to characterize T cells and monocytes, identifying key signatures based on their top 10 genes. Four T cell signatures were identified: T-sig1, enriched in CD4+ T cells; T-sig2, enriched in CD8+ memory and effector T cells; T-sig3, representing the TCR activation pathway and significantly elevated in WM patients; and T-sig4, enriched in CD8+ naïve T cells. There were no significant differences in T-sig3 between CXCR4mut and CXCR4wt patients.
 By defining T cell exhaustion and cytotoxicity scores, we found a significant reduction in the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T cells and an increase in exhaustion scores in WM patients, with no significant differences between CXCR4mut and CXCR4wt patients. Additionally, four monocyte signatures were identified. M-sig2, associated with cellular activation, was significantly increased in WM patients. M-sig4, enriched for MHC II-related molecules, was significantly reduced in CD14+ monocytes, indicating a possible enrichment of CD14+HLA-DR-/low MDSCs in WM patients. The pro-inflammatory M-sig1 was significantly increased, whereas the anti-inflammatory M-sig3 was significantly decreased in WM patients.
 To identify new biomarkers for WM tumor cells, we used logistic regression to create a classifier distinguishing WM tumor cell (clonal B cells and clonal plasma cells) from normal counterparts (memory B cells and normal plasma cells) in healthy donors, achieving an AUC of 0.99. This analysis revealed the top 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and normal cells.
 Patient-specific transcriptional changes were further discovered by comparing tumor cells to normal cells from the same samples. Among the top 20 DEGs, CR1 (CD35) had the highest AUC for distinguishing tumor cells from normal cells in patients. This finding was validated using an additional bulk-RNA dataset, which showed significantly reduced CD35 expression in WM.
 Given the role of CD35 in inhibiting BCR signaling pathways, we treated WM cell lines with CD35 antibodies. The CD35 antibody significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, with IC50 values for BCWM.1 cells ranging from 8.34-26.52μg/mL and for MWCL-1 cells from 5.67-12.04μg/mL. Flow cytometry demonstrated that CD35 antibodies induced apoptosis in WM tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner.
 Conclusion:
 Our study reveals that T cells and monocytes in the WM bone marrow microenvironment are hyperactivated but exhibit reduced cytotoxic function. We identified CD35 as a robust marker for distinguishing WM tumor cells from normal B-cell counterparts. CD35 targeting antibodies induced robust apoptosis and/or significantly inhibited the proliferation of WM tumor cells, supporting the investigation of CD35 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for WM.

        <tr id="Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease. A burst of autoimmune reactions in various systems can lead to severe clinical conditions closely associated with mortality. T cells serve as mediators that drive the occurrence and maintenance of inflammatory processes. Methods In this work, we employed single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) involving 27704 cells from the brain and spleen tissues of MRL/lpr mice and 25355 healthy controls from BALB/c mice to explore the heterogeneity of T cells and their migration from the spleen to the brain. Results We identified a distinct group of double-negative T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mice that significantly expressed Eomes and other specific markers. We used the analysis of pseudotime trajectory and enrichment to show that double-negative T cells in SLE mice are strongly associated with cellular senescence and exhaustion. Additionally, we focused on the interactions among DNT, astrocytes, and microglia in the mice brain. We observed greater expression of MDK-related ligand‒receptor pairs between astrocytes and double-negative T cells, indicating that MDK may be a therapeutic target for treating neuroinflammation in SLE. Discussion This research sheds light on the intricate dynamics of immune responses in mice with SLE, specifically highlighting the role of double-negative T cells and their connection to cellular senescence. The exploration of interactions between T cells, astrocytes, and microglia in the mice brain unveils potential avenues for therapeutic intervention, particularly in addressing neuronal inflammation in SLE.">

        <tr id="Introduction Very little is known about the role of macrophages as immune mediators during natural HIV infection. Humanized mice are an extremely valuable in vivo model for studying HIV pathogenesis. However, the presence of murine mononuclear phagocytes in these models represents a significant limitation for studying their human counterpart. Therefore, we have developed a novel humanized mouse model that allows selective depletion of human myeloid cells at a time point of our choosing. Methods We genetically engineered human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to express an inducible caspase-9 (iCas9) suicide system under a synthetic myeloid promoter. Using these HSPCs, we generated humanized mice. iCasp9 induction in vivo resulted in selective human myeloid cell death in this inducible human myeloid depletion (iHMD) mouse model. In addition, we co-cultured monocyte-derived macrophages with ex vivo HIV-infected PBMCs to further mechanistically investigate the effect of macrophages on HIV replication using flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and RNA sequencing of both macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Results HIV infection induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in HIV-infected humanized NSG mice during the early and late stages of HIV infection. Myeloid cell depletion in HIV-infected iHMD-NSG mice resulted in a rapid increase in HIV RNA replication, which was accompanied by a loss of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Co-culture of macrophages with ex vivo HIV-infected PBMCs reproduced their anti-HIV effects observed in vivo. Transcriptomic data showed macrophages upregulate antiviral cytokines and chemokines in co-culture, while inducing CD4+ T cells to upregulate HIV restriction factors and downregulate pathways involved in protein expression and cell replication. Discussion This study describes a novel role of macrophages as effector cells, both ex vivo and in vivo, acting against HIV replication and limiting disease progression.">

        <tr id="Ly49+ CD8 T cells are memory-phenotype (MP) cells expressing Ly49 family inhibitory receptors, that control autoimmune diseases development through the regulation of follicular CD4 T cells. During viral infection, their number increases, suggesting an involvement in antiviral responses. These cells do not derive from naive cells and are thought to develop in the thymus. This study identified two subsets of Ly49+ CD8 T cells, based on CD8β expression, in mice and humans. Lineage tracing and reliance on the transcription factor Zeb1 indicate a thymic origin via agonist selection. scRNAseq analysis revealed that a small fraction of CD8αβ-Ly49+ cells acquired an effector profile during vaccinia virus infection. Moreover, the majority of Ly49+ CD8 T cells seems to respond to cytokine-driven bystander signals. In vitro, these signals promoted the expression of effector molecules such as IFNγ and granzyme B, as well as the homing chemokine receptor CXCR5, potentially driving their recruitment to germinal centers. Summary This study shows that Ly49+ CD8 T cells comprises two subsets that develop in the thymus through agonist selection. In viral infection, both subsets respond to bystander stimuli that could drive their regulatory activity. Furthermore, some CD8αβ-expressing Ly49+ cells exert TCR-mediated antiviral response.">

 Background
 Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in tumor eradication. W-NK1 is a non-edited, cryopreserved off-the-shelf NK cell therapy product with a ‘memory-like’ phenotype that addresses challenges faced by adoptive cell therapies, such as poor resilience to adverse and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME). W-NK1 not only overcomes nutrient deprivation, inhibitory ligands, and reduced chemokine expression in the TME, but also recruits and activates dendritic and T cells through cytokine and chemokine production, thereby enhancing the overall immune response. This study aims to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of W-NK1's activity as well as its cellular heterogeneity using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) approaches.
 Methods
 W-NK1 were manufactured from healthy donor peripheral blood NK cells (herein referred to as conventional NK, cNK) which are activated, expanded, and cryopreserved to create an off-the-shelf memory NK-cell product. We then performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and scRNA-seq on both cNK (before cytokine priming) and W-NK1. Utilizing transfer learning, we compared W-NK1's single-cell transcriptomes to recently published reference maps encompassing NK cells from healthy donors (GSE197037 and https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8434223).
 Results
 We identified over 7,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01. Upregulated genes in W-NK1 included IL2RA, TPX, and MKI67, indicating an activated and proliferative state post-cytokine expansion. Additionally, genes involved in NK-cell regulation, such as CSF2 encoding GM-CSF, and BIRC5 encoding survivin, were also highly expressed. We observed reduced intra-donor variance in cluster proportions in W-NK1 compared to cNK cells, with tighter clustering in principal component analysis suggesting low batch-to-batch heterogeneity of the cell therapy product. Unbiased clustering and UMAP visualization of sc-RNA-seq data from more than 49,000 cells across four donors revealed eight cellular states (c0-c7), most of which were significantly differentially abundant in W-NK1 compared to cNK cells, as supported by linear modeling of sc-RNA-seq data. W-NK1's cytolytic capacity was supported by the high expression of established (perforin and GZMB) as well as novel cytotoxicity genes (FGFBP2, SPON2). Pseudotime inference illustrated a progression of maturation from cytotoxic W-NK1 in c0 to ‘hyper-metabolic’ and proliferative states in c7, driven by cytokine priming. Transfer learning highlighted unique transcriptional features of W-NK1, including high expression of NKG2A and low relatedness with adaptive NK states characterized by human cytomegalovirus-induced inflammatory memory. Pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment in glycolysis, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, DNA replication, and cell cycle-related gene programs in W-NK1 compared to cNK cells.
 Conclusion
 Our multi-omic analysis highlights potential advantages of W-NK1 in overcoming a hostile and nutrient-deprived TME, such as enhanced proliferation and metabolic fitness, and augmenting immune responses. These findings position W-NK1 as a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can regulate the immune system, making them promising treatments for immune-related diseases in animals. Priming these cells with inflammatory signals, like interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), may enhance their effectiveness. This study explores the use of IFN-γ-primed adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AMSCs) from dogs in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The researchers compared the therapeutic effects of naïve and primed AMSCs. IBD mice treated with IFN-γ-primed AMSCs showed better health outcomes, including reduced disease severity, less weight loss, and longer colon length. A histological analysis revealed less damage to the intestinal structures and fewer inflammatory cells in the mice receiving the primed AMSCs. Further investigation showed that IFN-γ priming shifted the balance of immune cells in the gut, reducing harmful pro-inflammatory macrophages and increasing protective anti-inflammatory ones. This led to decreased inflammation and the increased expression of stem cell markers, promoting tissue repair. Overall, the IFN-γ-primed AMSCs showed a superior therapeutic potential in reducing inflammation and supporting gut healing. This suggests that primed AMSCs could be a promising new treatment for chronic enteropathy (CE) in veterinary medicine.">

        <tr id="Macrophages play a crucial role in malignant pleural effusion (MPE), a frequent complication of advanced cancer. While C1q+ macrophages have been identified as a pro-tumoral cluster, direct evidence supporting the role of C1q-mediated macrophages remains to be elucidated. This study employed global and macrophage-specific knockout mice to investigate the role of C1q in MPE. The data demonstrated that C1q deficiency in macrophages suppressed MPE and prolonged mouse survival. scRNA-seq analysis of the C1qa-/- mouse MPE model revealed that C1q deficiency significantly decreased the proportion of M2 macrophages in MPE. In vitro experiments suggested that C1q expression was gradually upregulated during M2 polarization, which was C1q-dependent, as was antigen presentation. Deficiency of C1q in macrophages rescued the exhausted status of CD8+ T cells and enhanced the immune activity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in both MPE and pleural tumors. Cell-to-cell interaction analysis demonstrated that C1q deficiency attenuated the immunoinhibitory effects of macrophages on NK cells by downregulating the CCR2-CCL2 signaling axis. Metabolomic analysis revealed significantly elevated hippuric acid levels in C1q-deficient mouse MPE. Treatment with either hippuric acid or a CCR2 antagonist inhibited MPE and tumor growth, with an even more pronounced effect observed when both treatments were combined.">

 Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can evade the immune system attack through the support of the bone marrow microenvironment and various cellular and molecular mechanisms. Within the bone marrow microenvironment, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were identified as a key contributor in promoting AML survival. Furthermore, MSCs can suppress the activity and proliferation of T cells through the expression and secretion of the immune checkpoint ligand, PD-L1. In addition, overexpression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors on CD8+ T cells of AML patients further hints at the critical involvement of the immune checkpoint pathways in AML immune escape. This evidence supports the clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in reversing MSC-mediated T cell suppression. However, the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in AML, specifically for MSC-mediated immune evasion, has not yet been firmly established. We hypothesize that 1) bone marrow MSCs assist AML cells evading the T cell attack through the overexpression of inhibitory immune checkpoints, and 2) MSC-mediated T cell suppression could be reversed using CPI.
 Methods: In this study, we established a 3-dimensional (3D) biomimetic model of decellularized Wharton's jelly matrix and primary AML patient samples to simulate the bone marrow microenvironment and the interplay between AML cells, MSCs, and T cells. The MSCs were isolated and expanded from the bone marrow mononuclear cells of each AML patient (n=4) to be used for the 3D model development. The AML cells and PBMCs for each of the corresponding patient were seeded in the presence or absence of MSCs and incubated for 1 day to assess the level of AML killing and the level of T cell activation using a far red-labeled AML cell-based killing assay and flow cytometry of intracellular cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα), respectively. An identical experimental set up was incubated for 3 days for immunophenotypic characterization of the surface markers (AML cells: CD33, CD34, HLA-ABC, PD-L1; CD8+ T cells: CD3, CD4, CD8, PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3) using flow cytometry. With the established 3D model, the effect of CPI (bispecific anti-PD-1 x anti-LAG-3 DART®molecule, MGD013/tebotelimab; anti-LAG-3 IgG4 antibody; and anti-PD-1 IgG4 antibody, nivolumab) on AML killing and T-cell activity were assessed and compared to a palivizumab-based IgG4 antibody as a control. The DART molecule and antibodies, except for nivolumab, were provided by MacroGenics, Inc., MD, USA.
 Results: The patient-derived bone marrow MSCs were immunophenotypically characterized by flow cytometry to be ≥95% positive in CD73, CD90, and CD105 expression; and <2% positive in CD45 expression. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of the cryostat serial sectioned 3D matrix scaffolds showed the physical contacts and the potential co-localization between the three cell types within the 3D matrix scaffold. To identify the impact of the MSCs on CD8+ T cell killing of AML cells within the 3D model, we observed a lowered level of T cell-based AML killing (n=4; P=0.0273), accompanied with a lowered intracellular IFNγ and TNFα levels of CD8+ T cells (n=4; P=0.0288 and P=0.0433, respectively). A trend of higher exhaustion marker LAG-3 expression was also observed in the presence of MSCs (n=4; P=0.0602) with a statistically significant higher expression of TIM-3 (n=4; P=0.0416). Assessing the influence of MSCs on AML immune evasion, a trend of lowered MHC-I expression (n=4; P=0.0684) and a higher level of PD-L1 expression (n=4; P=0.0349) on AML cells was observed in the presence of MSCs. Comparing the effect of the immune CPI relative to the control antibody in reversing the MSC-mediated immunosuppression, the LAG-3 inhibitor-treated condition was shown to have a higher level of AML killing (n=4; P=0.0178), compared to nivolumab and MGD013 treatments. The elevated AML killing of the LAG-3 inhibitor treatment condition is accompanied with a higher level of intracellular IFNγ expression of CD8+ T cells (n=4; P=0.0141).
 Conclusion: MSCs play a major role in influencing CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of AML cells through the suppression of CD8+ T cell activity, potentially involving the LAG-3 immune checkpoint mechanism. LAG-3 immune checkpoint inhibitor showed effective response in reversing T-cell suppression within the AML microenvironment and warrants further investigation as an immunotherapeutic in AML.

        <tr id="Alimentary tract inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is treated by systemically administered drugs that alter fundamental host immune responses. Biologics that target tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are first-line biologics in IBD, used widely for their effectiveness, steroid-sparing quality, and lower cost. While they enable a significant proportion of patients to achieve clinical remission, they carry an increased risk of infection and poor serological responses to vaccination. Conversely, our understanding of adaptive T cell responses in anti-TNF-treated IBD patients remains limited. The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines has prompted research that both challenges and refines our view on immunomodulatory therapy and its potential implications for immunity and protection. Here, we review these emergent findings, evaluate how they shape our understanding of vaccine-induced T cell responses in the context of anti-TNF therapy in IBD, and provide a perspective highlighting the need for a holistic evaluation of both cellular and humoral immunity in this population.">

        <tr id="Thrombin promotes the proliferation and function of CD8+ T cells. To test if thrombin prevents exhaustion and sustains antiviral T cell activity during chronic viral infection, we depleted the thrombin-precursor prothrombin to 10% of normal levels in mice prior to infection with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Unexpectedly, prothrombin insufficiency resulted in 100% mortality after infection that was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T cells, suggesting that reduced availability of prothrombin enhances virus-induced immunopathology. Yet, the number, function, and apparent exhaustion of virus-specific T cells were measurably unaffected by prothrombin depletion. Histological analysis of the lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and brain did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or increased tissue damage in low prothrombin mice that could explain mortality. Viral loads were also similar in infected mice regardless of prothrombin levels. Instead, infection of prothrombin-depleted mice resulted in a severe, T cell-dependent anemia associated with increased hemolysis. Thus, thrombin plays an unexpected protective role in preventing hemolytic anemia during virus infection, with potential implications for patients who are using direct thrombin inhibitors as an anticoagulant therapy.">

        <tr id="Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.">

 Rationale
 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is recognized as a chronic inflammatory condition. Impaired vaccination responses, frequent alloimmunization, a high prevalence of autoimmune diseases and an increased risk of graft rejection following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation indicate altered adaptive immune responses. Therefore, elucidating the phenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in SCD is essential for improving insight and future patient management.
 Aim
 To evaluate the characteristics of adaptive immune cells involved in chronic inflammation and related pathophysiology in SCD patients, we investigated the differences in PBMC subsets between SCD patients and ethnicity- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs).
 Methods
 PBMCs from HbSS/HbSβ0 patients (≥ 12 years) in steady state and HCs were analyzed using a 5x14-color flow cytometry panel for in-depth characterization of B, T, T-helper (Th), T follicular-helper (Tfh), natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Measurements were standardized using rainbow calibration beads on a Symphony flow cytometer. Cell populations were identified manually and computationally by conventional gating (FlowJo) and unsupervised clustering (FlowSOM), respectively. Statistics included Benjamini-Hochberg correction of false discovery rate.
 Results
 The study included 46 patients (37% female, 94% HbSS, 78% on hydroxyurea): 26 adults (median age 25 years, range 18 - 57) and 20 adolescents (16 years, 12 - 18). Among 18 HCs (33% HbAS), 12 were adults (30 years, 22 - 42) and 6 were adolescents (16.5 years, 13 - 18). Subgroup analysis revealed no differences in proportions of immune cell subsets between age groups or hydroxyurea use.
 Gated analysis of B cells (CD45+CD14-CD19+) showed major differences between patients and HCs: patients had higher naive transitional B cells (IgD+CD27-, p <0.001) and lower proportions of unswitched memory (IgD+CD27+, p <0.001), switched memory (IgD-CD27+, p <0.001), and double negative memory (IgD-CD27-, p= 0.003) B cells. Patients also had fewer activated naive/activated memory (CD24-CD38-, p= 0.029) B cells within total B cells. Computational analysis confirmed these results with 11 of 18 FlowSOM metaclusters showing significant differences between patients and HCs: one metacluster, representing naive transitional B cells and containing 68% of total B cells, was enriched in patients (p= 0.004) but with a lower mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD21 (p= 0.007). Several metaclusters containing memory B cell subsets were less abundant in patients.
 Gated analysis of T cells (CD45+CD14-CD3+) revealed no differences in CD4+ or CD8+ cells, regulatory (CD4+CD25+CD127-FoxP3+), naive (CCR7+CD45RA+), effector (CCR7-CD45RA+), central memory (CCR7+CD45RA-), effector memory (CCR7-CD45RA-) T cells, or Th subsets. However, patients had more γδ+ T cells (p <0.001) and less αβ+ T cells (p <0.001) compared to HCs. Computational analysis showed that MCs containing CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) T cells were significantly enriched in patients compared to HCs (p= 0.008), which was confirmed by manual gating of DN T cells.
 SCD patients had fewer conventional CD11c+CD141+ cDC1s (p <0.001) and CD11c+CD1c+ cDC2s (p= 0.021), but more CD123+ plasmacytoid DCs (p= 0.024). Total NK cells were decreased, but with a higher proportion of regulatory CD56++ NK cells (p= 0.005). Patients had more classical monocytes (CD14+CD16-, p= 0.001), but fewer Slan+ and non-classical monocytes (CD14-CD16+, p <0.001). FlowSOM analysis revealed, that metaclusters containing CD56-, but Slan+ and/or CD16+ monocytes, one metacluster matching the phenotype of cDC1s, and one metacluster containing CD11c+ NK cells were significantly diminished in patients.
 Conclusion
 We present a comprehensive and unique computational immune phenotype evaluation of PBMCs in SCD patients. Our analysis reveals significant perturbations in B cell subsets, with a shift towards naive transitional and less memory B cells, likely due to SCD-related hyposplenia. SCD patients also exhibit increased DN and γδ+ T cells, common in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions. Finally, we observed a decrease of cDCs, Slan+ monocytes and NK cells expressing CD11c, crucial for regulating immune responses. Further study of these PBMC subsets may reveal new insights into chronic inflammation and adaptive immune dysregulation in SCD.

        <tr id="Modulation of immune tone at mucosal surfaces is critical to maintain homeostasis while facilitating the handling of emerging threats. One dynamic component of immune modulation is the phagocytosis and clearance of apoptotic bodies known as efferocytosis that inhibits inflammation by promoting its resolution. Here, we evaluated the effects of apoptotic body phagocytosis by intestinal epithelial stem and progenitor cells (ISCs). Unexpectedly, instead of immunomodulation through efferocytosis, this process elevated local immune system activity. To achieve this result, ISCs actively engaged apoptotic bodies in a unique fashion, leading to their engulfment and ultimate delivery to lysosomes for processing. We found that ISCs were capable of actively recruiting inert material such as apoptotic bodies by using actin-based intrinsic biomechanical processes. Uptake of apoptotic bodies was facilitated by complement factor C3 produced by apoptotic bodies themselves. ISCs in turn generated signals heightening T cell activity that was driven in part by ISC-generated TNF. Taken together, uptake of apoptotic bodies by ISCs produced a local inflammatory alert to specific immune cells. This altered paradigm for the response to phagocytosed apoptotic bodies fits the needs of active mucosal surfaces and demonstrates that efferocytosis as currently defined is not a universal response of all cell types.">

Bioplexing and flow cytometry was employed to analyse total and cell specific protein secretion respectively. Ex-vivo inhibition studies were performed using targeted monoclonal antibodies or small molecule STAT inhibitors. 3) Results CD4+ T-cells were found to be the primary source for meta-inflammation in T2DM patients with multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibody isotypes. TNF-a acting through STAT-3 was shown as the primary pathway implicating meta-inflammation through CD4+ T-cells, wherein inhibitor studies revealed subtle pathways differences between TNF-a or STAT-3 inhibition. 4) Conclusions Our result suggests that chronic meta-inflammation with a dysregulated biochemical profile have severe implications on immune function. Additionally, TNF-a and STAT-3 inhibition are good therapeutic targets for better T2MD treatment in ameliorating meta-inflammation.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Although bladder cancer (BCa) is known for its immunogenic characteristics, it often shows limited responsiveness to currently approved immunotherapies. Our previous research identified natural killer (NK) cells as significant contributors to improved survival outcomes in BCa patients. In this study, we found that eribulin, a microtubule destabilizer typically used for breast cancer, can activate NK cells. While clinical trials are exploring the use of eribulin in BCa treatment, the underlying mechanism was previously unknown. We demonstrated that low-dose eribulin activates NK cells, leading to reduced tumor burden and improved survival in various murine models. Mechanistically, eribulin enhanced NK cell migration and cytotoxicity against BCa cells, promoted an anti-tumor NK cell phenotype, and reduced exhaustion markers, uncovering an unexpected role of low-dose chemotherapy in boosting NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Given eribulin’s clinical availability, our findings support its potential as a rapid bench-to-bedside immune-adjuvant treatment for BCa.">

 Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are critical for initiating and sustaining tumor-reactive CD8 T cells; lack of functional cDC1s is a key driver for failed tumor immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. However, what factors cause the cDC1 insufficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. Commensal microbiota has emerged as a key regulator of TME and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Nonetheless, most studies have focused on the intestinal microbiome; it remains underexplored whether and how the local microbiota within tumors influences the anti-cancer immunity. Using the autochthonous Kras LSL-G12D/+ ; p53 flox/flox (KP) mouse model of lung cancer, we found an increased local bacterial burden and altered bacterial composition associated with lung tumors. Importantly, this local microbiota suppresses the anti-tumor CD8 T cell response both at baseline and in response to ICB therapies. Specifically, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that the microbiota shapes the functional subsets of tumor-reactive CD8 T cells. Bacterial depletion promotes the accumulation of stem-like Tpex cells (precursor of exhausted T cells) in the TME, which serve as a reservoir of effector CD8 T cells and mediate an effective response upon ICB treatment. To distinguish the function of the local microbiota within TME from the distal gut microbiota, we developed a new method of aerosolized antibiotic treatment, which selectively ablates the intra-tumoral lung microbiota while preserving the intact gut microbiota. Using this approach, we demonstrated that removal of the intra-tumoral lung microbiota markedly improves the tumor-reactive T cell response and sensitizing “cold” lung tumors to ICB therapies. Mechanistically, we identified cDC1s as a central player in microbiota-mediated suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Local microbiota diminishes cDC1 quality and quantity in the lung TME, resulting in impaired T cell priming and Tpex maintenance. At the molecular level, our data revealed that bacterial products derived from the local microbiota induce type I interferon expression in tumor-associated myeloid cells and enhance GM-CSF production from cancer cells: chronic type I interferon and GM-CSF signaling acts cooperatively to reduce the functional cDC1 population. Combining in vitro cDC1 assays, competitive bone marrow chimera experiments and cDC1-specific knockout models, we establish the causal relationships between the local microbiota, IFN-I and GM-CSF signaling in cDC1s, and the tumor response to ICB. Altogether, our study uncovered a dominant role of tumor-associated microbiota in inhibiting cDC1s and suppressing anti-tumor immunity through type I IFN and GM-CSF dependent pathways in lung cancer. Our findings not only identify the intra-tumoral microbiota as a critical therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment, but also provide new insights into the tissue-specific, context-dependent regulatory mechanisms of cDC1s in the TME.

        <tr id="Due to the vital importance of the lungs, lung-related diseases and their control are very important. Severe inflammatory responses mediated by immune cells were among the leading causes of lung tissue pathology and damage during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, uncontrolled immune cell responses can lead to lung tissue damage in other infectious and non-infectious diseases. It is essential to control immune responses in a way that leads to homeostasis. Immunosuppressive drugs only suppress inflammatory responses and do not affect the homeostasis of reactions. The therapeutic application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in addition to restoring immune homeostasis, can promote the regeneration of lung tissue through the production of growth factors and differentiation into lung-related cells. However, the communication between MSCs and immune cells after treatment of pulmonary diseases is essential, and investigating this can help develop a clinical perspective. Different studies in the clinical phase showed that MSCs can reverse fibrosis, increase regeneration, promote airway remodeling, and reduce damage to lung tissue. The proliferation and differentiation potential of MSCs is one of the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects. Furthermore, they can secrete exosomes that affect the function of lung cells and immune cells and change their function. Another important mechanism is that MSCs reduce harmful inflammatory responses through communication with innate and adaptive immune cells, which leads to a shift of the immune system toward regulatory and hemostatic responses.">

Yet, current clinical intervention strategies do not mitigate inflammation sequalae necessitating the development of innovative approaches to reduce inflammation and minimize deleterious effects of TBI. Herein, a subcutaneous formulation based on polymer of alpha-ketoglutarate (paKG) delivering glycolytic inhibitor PFK15 (PFKFB3 inhibitor, a rate limiting step in glycolysis), alpha-ketoglutarate (to fuel Krebs cycle) and peptide antigen from myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151) was utilized as the prophylactic immunosuppressive formulation in a mouse model of TBI. In vitro, the paKG(PFK15+PLP) vaccine formulation stimulated proliferation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and induced generation of T helper-2 cells. When given subcutaneously in the periphery to two weeks prior to mice sustaining a TBI, the active vaccine formulation increased frequency of immunosuppressive macrophages and dendritic cells in the periphery and the brain at day 7 post- TBI and by 28 days post-TBI enhanced PLP-specific immunosuppressive cells infiltrated the brain. While immunohistology measurements of neuroinflammation were not altered 28 days post-TBI, the vaccine formulation improved motor function and enhanced autophagy mediated genes in a spatial manner in the brain. Overall, these data suggest that the TBI vaccine formulation successfully induced an anti-inflammatory profile and decreased TBI-associated inflammation.

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, particularly in combating viral infections and malignancies. CD8 T cells, derived from bone marrow progenitors and matured in the thymus, play an essential role in immune defense through their cytotoxic activity. These cells are distinguished by their ability to recognize and eliminate cells that present specific antigens via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Upon activation by antigen recognition, they proliferate and differentiate into effector cells capable of eliminating infected or abnormal cells.CD8+ T cells develop in the thymus and express the CD8 co-receptor, which interacts specifically with MHC class I molecules. When a naïve CD8+ T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC) displaying an antigen bound to MHC class I, it undergoes activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells. The primary function of these cells is to eliminate infected or malignant cells by inducing apoptosis through the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes or by engaging death receptors on target cells. Over the past few decades, CD8+ T cells have garnered significant attention for their potential in immunotherapy, particularly in cancer treatment. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of CD8+ T cells in immunotherapy, their mechanisms of action, and the challenges associated with harnessing their full potential.

 Introduction: Acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) can often be cured with multiagent chemotherapy but prognosis following relapse remains poor with conventional chemotherapy alone. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells and bispecific T cell engager therapy can be effective in treating acute B-ALL, NK cell therapies may emerge as an alternative approach as they have a lower risk of adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANs). Notably, when briefly stimulated with the cytokines IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18, NK cells acquire memory-like properties and demonstrate enhanced anti-cancer responses. Tafasitamab (TAFA) is an Fc-enhanced humanized anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody, that has been approved for use in diffuse large B cell lymphoma. TAFA exerts its effects through antibody-derived cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is a critical anti-tumor function mediated by NK cells.
 Purpose: To evaluate whether the combination of memory-like NK cells (CIMLNK) with TAFA can augment cytotoxicity in B-ALL.
 Methods: NK cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy donors (n=8). For the generation of CIMLNK, NK cells were incubated overnight (12-16 hours) with IL-12 10 ng/ml, IL-15 50 ng/ml and IL-18 50 ng/ml. For the in vitro cytotoxicity assays, target cells (NALM-6 or RS4;11- both B-ALL cell lines) were labeled with CD71-FITC mAb and co-incubated with the effectors (NK or CIMLNK) at 2.5 effector: target (E: T) ratio, with or without TAFA (0.5 - 1 ug/ml) for 4 hours. PI was added just before analysis by flow cytometry (BD-LSR Fortessaâ) . The percentage (%) of target cell cytolysis in all conditions was calculated using the following formula: %CD71+PI+ exp - %CD71+PI+ target cell only.
 For the in vivo experiments, irradiated immunodeficient female NSG mice received 10,000 Nalm6-luc, via teil vein injection (IV) on day 0. On day 1 TAFA was administered at 0.3 - 0.5 mg/kg, IV or IP respectively. 1 X 106 CIMLNK derived from healthy donors (n=3), were injected IV either 4h or 24h after the tumor injection. The luciferase bioluminescence imaging (BLI) system was used to determine leukemia burden.
 Statistics: One-way ANOVA tests with Tukey's test for multiple comparisons were used to detect differences among the culture conditions. For the in vivo studies, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed using the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test. BLI data were compared with multiple unpaired t-tests. P-values of < 0.05 were considered significant.
 Results: CIMLNK + TAFA resulted in significantly enhanced cytotoxicity against the NALM6 compared with the CIMLNK alone (84.2% vs 24.3%, p=0.004) as well as against RS4;11, (63.6% vs 10.1%, p=0.0094). Notably, the combination of TAFA+ CIMLNK significantly increased cytotoxicity when compared to NK+TAFA against NALM6 (84.2% vs 38.9%, p=0.005) but not in the RS4;11 cells (63.6% vs 28.3%, p=0.11). CIMLNK alone demonstrated a trend toward higher cytotoxicity when compared to NK cells against NALM6 (24.3% vs 1.1%, p=0.06) and RS4;11 (10.1% vs 0.9%, p=0.14). Cytotoxicity was not observed against these cell lines when TAFA was used alone.
 In the in vivo experiments, the mean BLI in the mice treated with the combination therapy at week 3 was reduced by 1 log compared with that of untreated mice (p = 0.01) when CIMLNK were administered the same day as the tumor. In terms of survival, combining CIMLNK with TAFA resulted in a median survival of 35 days, which was significantly higher than that seen in untreated mice (28 days, p= 0.01), CIMLNK (26.5 days, p=0.009) and TAFA monotherapy (28 days, p= 0.003).
 Conclusion: The combination of CIMLNK + TAFA exerts synergistic effects against acute B-cell leukemia and may prove to be an alternative therapeutic approach for patients with relapsed refractory disease.

 Glioblastoma harbors a tumor microenvironment (TME) that is mostly devoid of T cell effector infiltration but is dominated by immune suppressive microglia, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppresser cells. The innate immune cells in the TME have impaired phagocytosis and antigen presentation and are inadequate for triggering the subsequent immune activating signals needed for anti-tumor effector responses. Phagocytic activity can also be blocked by the upregulation of CD47 on the tumor cells. In the immune checkpoint resistant Qki-/- Pten-/- P53-/- (QPP) glioma model, intratumoral treatment with the synthetic cyclic di-nucleotide STING agonist IACS-8803 (8803) induces global immunological reprogramming and long-term survival resistant to tumor rechallenge. More specifically, in the infiltrating myeloid stroma 8803 increases costimulatory protein CD86 while reducing the expression of suppressive markers CD163 and CD206. Conventional type 1 dendritic cells are increased in both the TME (p<0.05) and the draining cervical lymph node (p<0.01). Intratumoral infiltration of both CD8 T (p<0.05) and NK (p<0.001) cells increases. However, only T cells, but not NK cells, are necessary for 8803 therapeutic activity when assessed with in vivo NK cell depletion studies and treatment in the RAG-/- background. STING activation increases microglial phagocytic capacity, but also induces a compensatory increase in SIRPα expression (p<0.001) – the ligand for CD47. 8803 synergizes with anti-CD47 blockade to enhance microglia phagocytosis of QPP glioblastoma cells in vitro. Finally, the combination of 8803 and anti-CD47 synergizes to extend both median survival and the fraction of long-term survivors in orthotopic QPP-bearing mice (QPP8v; vehicle control MS=39d, anti-CD47 MS=40d, 8803 MS=67d 20% long-term survival, 8803 + anti-CD47 MS=107.5d 40% long-term survival).

        <tr id="Simple Summary Rich cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in cancerous tissues is associated with better clinical prognosis. A major obstacle to tumor T cell infiltration can be the scarcity of adhesion molecules expressed by the growing tumor neo-vasculature that limits the binding and extravasation of effector lymphocytes. In the present study, we aimed at reversing this endothelial cell anergy in vitro by using bispecific antibodies that redirect T cells to endothelial cell growth factor receptors and mediate T cell activation via CD3 and costimulation via CD28 in direct contact with endothelial cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of T cells and endothelial cells resulted in a profound upregulation of adhesion molecules due to the secretion of proinflammatory T cell cytokines. T-cell adhesion to previously quiescent endothelial cells, as well as their capacity to migrate through an endothelial cell monolayer and subsequently kill breast cancer cell spheroids, was greatly augmented.">

 Immunosuppression in glioblastoma is a powerful impediment to effective immunotherapy. We used maximal tumor sampling and genome-wide coexpression analysis of RNA sequencing, on 69 samples from 8 patients, to identify a module of 270 genes marked by LRRC25, determined by top fidelity score, that covaries with many immunosuppressive molecules. An immunosuppressive module was independently derived from an expanded cohort of 319 samples from 28 GBM also marked by LRRC25 by top fidelity score. Within the gene module, we observed strong co-variation of markers for monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells with LRRC25. In published single-cell RNA-seq from glioma, we determined that LRRC25 is expressed by neutrophils and myeloid cells while absent from NK-cells. LRRC25 is also constitutively expressed in monocytes and neutrophils while being upregulated by microglia and DCs in the tumor core and necrotic regions. In addition to covariation with multiple cell-type specific markers we also discovered that LRRC25 expression is tightly associated with several members of the TYROBP causal signaling network in microglia. Thus, LRRC25 may play a novel role in TYROBP signaling which may, in turn, represent a novel mechanism of NK cell and neutrophil immunosuppression in glioma. We confirmed LRRC25 RNA expression in patient samples by RNAscope co-stained with an anti-CD163 antibody indicating myeloid expression, as well as tumor cell expression determined by histopathology. Although LRRC25 is known to mediate IFN and NFKb signaling in myeloid cells in-vitro, its function in glioma remains understudied. While significant efforts have focused on mechanisms of myeloid to T-cell immunosuppression, less focus has been given to mechanisms of myeloid to NK-cell and neutrophil immunosuppression, despite the fact they exist at levels comparable to T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. This work will be followed up with antibody validation as well as genetic manipulation of LRRC25 in-vitro and in-vivo.">

        <tr id="Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) or polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC) are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases. They are crucial in the host-response to invading pathogens, especially during acute illness, and are associated with poor prognosis in many infectious diseases. However, their gene expression profile and contribution to disease outcomes are not well described. We conducted a meta-analysis of gene expression datasets from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), focusing on patients with viral and bacterial infections. We identified a consensus set of 2,798 differentially expressed genes. Among these, 49 genes were commonly found in both the neutrophil degranulation pathway and the granule lumen-specific community. To validate this signature, we evaluated its expression in RNA-seq datasets, finding consistent upregulation of 24 genes in severe infections, 17 of them overlapped with genes overexpressed in CD16int cells. We also investigated the abundance of LDN-related proteins in a PBMC proteomics dataset from a cohort of sepsis and septic shock patients, identifying 13 proteins with significantly higher levels in sepsis and septic shock patients compared to healthy controls. In conclusion, our study identified a pattern of 17 upregulated LDN genes, common to PBMC-transcriptome and RNA-seq, and up-regulated in CD16int, associated with acute infections and severe clinical outcomes, marking the first time these genes have been collectively presented as a potential signature of LDNs in relation to disease severity. Further research with prospective cohorts is needed to validate this LDN signature and explore its clinical implications. Summary Sentence Meta-analysis revealed a 17-gene LDN signature associated with severity in acute infections, providing potential biomarkers for clinical outcomes in infectious diseases.">

 Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) is associated with venous thrombosis. In a CT26 colorectal murine tumor model, we observed that cancer cell-derived tissue factor (TF) contributes to development of ICI-associated thrombosis (IAT), as demonstrated by reduced IVC thrombus size in mice bearing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated TF-deleted cancer cells. ICI-treated mice also exhibited elevated levels of neutrophil extracellular traps compared to IgG-treated controls. The mechanisms underlying TF induction and neutrophil activation in IAT are still unclear.
 To obtain mechanistic insights, we assessed the dynamics of cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and circulation, and the signaling pathways responsible for cytokine-induced TF upregulation in cancer cells and extracellular vesicles (EV). Cytokine expression in tumor and plasma from mice treated with IgG and ICI (anti-PD-1+anti-CTLA-4) was assessed using a cytokine array (proteome profiler) with densitometric analysis and also quantified with a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) U-PLEX assay. Spearman's correlation analysis assessed cytokine correlations between tumor and plasma. T cell involvement was evaluated by depleting T cells with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies before ICI treatment. IFN-γ effects on TF expression and TF+EV release by CT26 cancer cells were analyzed using pharmacological inhibition (JAK1/2 inhibitor) and genetic silencing (siRNA targeting IRF-1 and Rab27a).
 Cytokine profiling in ICI-treated mice tumors showed significant increases in IFN-γ (2-fold) and its responsive chemokines, monokine induced by IFN-γ (MIG, 1.8-fold) and interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC, 8.8-fold), implying T cell recruitment. Elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α, 6.8-fold) and B lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC, 2.9-fold) were also observed, along with macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1β, 5.4-fold) and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, 3.4-fold). Increased plasma keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC, 4.7-fold), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, 2-fold), and monocyte chemotactic protein-5 (MCP-5, 3.4-fold) indicated myeloid cell activation. The U-PLEX multiplex assay confirmed significant increases in eight tumor cytokines from ICI-treated mice: IFN-γ (3.8-fold), TNF-α (1.6-fold), BLC (2.8-fold), MIP-1β (1.8-fold), RANTES (2.1-fold), SDF-1 (1.9-fold), IL-6 (1.7-fold), and GM-CSF (1.9-fold). The higher sensitivity of MSD platform detected increased circulating levels of IFN-γ (2.6-fold, 1.62 vs 0.63 pg/ml), TNF-α (1.6-fold, 11.98 vs 8.16 pg/ml), IL-6 (1.6-fold, 352.02 vs 218.88 pg/ml), MCP-5 (1.5-fold, 413.03 vs 276.45 pg/ml), and MIP-2 (1.7-fold, 134.18 vs 79.71 pg/ml), in addition to KC (1.7-fold, 177.14 vs 105.76 pg/ml) and MCP-1 (2.1-fold, 115.34 vs 55.79 pg/ml). Elevated KC and MIP-2 (murine IL-8 homologues) align with our previous finding that higher IL-8 pretreatment levels in ICI-treated cancer patients correlate with thrombosis, suggesting endothelial activation. Spearman's correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations in four cytokines between tumor and plasma of ICI-treated mice: IFN-γ (r=0.6520, p=0.0216), TNF-α (r=0.7170, p=0.0026), MIP-1β (r-0.6547, p=0.0081), and RANTES (r=0.7178, p=0.0008), indicating systemic reflection of local tumor inflammatory responses. IFN-γ correlated strongly with MCP-1 and MIP-1β in circulation (r>0.5, p>0.05). T cell depletion significantly reduced MIP-1β, RANTES, and IFN-γ levels (129 vs 60 pg/ml, p=0.0091). In vitro studies with CT26 cancer cells demonstrated that IFN-γ upregulates TF via the JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway and increases TF+EV release via IRF1-Rab27a axis, confirmed by siRNA targeting IRF1 and Rab27a.
 IFN-γ released by ICI-activated T cells may upregulate TF expression and TF+EV secretion in cancer cells, and stimulate monocytes and macrophages in the TME to secrete TNF-α, MIP-1β, RANTES. Elevated circulating IFN-γ (and/or TNF-α) can activate endothelial cells to release of cytokines such as KC and MIP-2 (for neutrophils) and MCP-1 and MCP-5 (for monocytes). Thus, IFN-γ induces TF in the TME and modulates a prothrombotic state in circulation by mediating proinflammatory cytokine release. Understanding these cytokine networks and correlations will provide insight into mechanisms of IAT.

        <tr id="Abstract The intestinal immune system is the largest immune organ in the human body. Excessive immune response to intestinal cavity induced by harmful stimuli including pathogens, foreign substances and food antigens is an important cause of inflammatory diseases such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although great progress has been made in the treatment of IBD by some immune-related biotherapeutic products, yet a considerable proportion of IBD patients remain unresponsive or immune tolerant to immunotherapeutic strategy. Therefore, it is necessary to further understand the mechanism of immune cell populations involved in enteritis, including dendritic cells, macrophages and natural lymphocytes, in the steady-state immune tolerance of IBD, in order to find effective IBD therapy. In this review, we discussed the important role of innate and adaptive immunity in the development of IBD. And the relationship between intestinal immune system disorders and microflora crosstalk were also presented. We also focus on the new findings in the field of T cell immunity, which might identify novel cytokines, chemokines or anti-cytokine antibodies as new approaches for the treatment of IBD.">

 Objective: Dysfunctional cytokine-driven inflammatory storms in patients with idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) are a recurring issue affecting both symptoms and mortality, yet a thorough understanding of the involved immune cells remains incomplete. A comprehensive and detailed peripheral immune landscape is crucial for effectively treating iMCD.
 Design: We employed single-cell RNA sequencing of 150936 cells from a cohort of 19 individuals, including 15 iMCD patients with mild or severe disease, as well as 4 healthy controls. For validation, we also enrolled a second cohort of 108 newly diagnosed iMCD patients with available IFN-γ data from 2015 to 2024.
 Results: The activation and mobilization pervasive across all immune cells subtype during flares contribute to widespread systemic inflammatory storm in iMCD. Peripheral memory B C2 cells were the main source of plasma B and activated B cells in iMCD. Additionally, this cell subpopulation is where IL-6 mRNA is predominantly found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PADI/CCL/IL7R monocytes may be the primary effector cells in peripheral circulatory inflammatory storms. These cells exhibit the highest inflammatory scores, show the greatest activation of IL-6 signaling pathways, and overproduce VEGF-A, thereby being classified as pro-inflammatory monocytes. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory monocytes stimulated the overproduction of IL6 through promoting memory B C2 cell proliferation and transitions via BAFF signaling pathway, thus forming a vicious cycle that constantly stimulates the generation and expansion of inflammatory storms. In the cell-cell communication analysis, we identified IFN-II as a crucial signaling pathway, uniquely enriched in iMCD, with the highest relative strength index in both count and weight signaling patterns. Ligand-receptor analysis showed IFNG was mainly expressed in KLCRC2 NK, GZMK NK, NKT, and CD8TEX cells, whereas IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 were mainly expressed in pro-inflammatory monocytes. Besides, the level of IFNG expression was observed to correlate with iMCD severity. In the second iMCD cohort used for validation, IFN-γ levels were positively correlated with disease severity but negatively correlated with treatment response and progression-free survival (PFS).
 Conclusion: This study provided an important resource for in-depth understanding the pathogenesis of iMCD and identify additional therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are specialized lymphocytes that help protect against viruses and cancer. However, in the context of bacterial infections, NK cells can be harmful, rather than protective. Such immune pathogenesis by NK cells has been linked to the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In this context, IFN-γ-deficient mice display increased survival rates in response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which causes life-threatening, invasive systemic infections with high mortality rates in humans. However, little is known about how NK cells respond to S. aureus in humans. In this study, we found that the peripheral blood of patients with bloodstream S. aureus infection was enriched for NKG2A+ NK cells with greater cytokine producing capacity, compared to those hospitalized with Escherichia coli bloodstream infections. As a possible mechanistic cause, superantigens from S. aureus promoted the expansion of CD57− NKG2A+ NK cells which produced IFN-γ through an IL-12-independent mechanism and exhibited reduced levels of CD16 compared to unstimulated NK cells. These data suggest that S. aureus bloodstream infection in humans promotes a phenotypic shift towards NKG2A+ NK cells with greater IFN-γ producing capacity, providing a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis. AUTHOR SUMMARY Natural Killer (NK) cells are specialized immune cells that provide crucial defence against viruses but can also respond to bacterial infections, especially in humans. During bloodstream infection by Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans, NK cells may actually be harmful, rather than protective, to the host. However, very little is known about the NK cell response to invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections in humans. Here, we show that human patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli, infections have an increased frequency of NK cells with increased pro-inflammatory capacity. Furthermore, we show that toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which help the bacteria evade the protective effects of T cells the immune system (“superantigens”), promoted the expansion of these pro-inflammatory NK cells, providing a possible mechanistic cause for their increased presence in patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus infections. Collectively, these results suggest that Staphylococcus aureus infection triggers phenotypic and functional changes in NK cells that provide a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis">

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells possess different mechanisms to escape immune recognition. Type-I interferon (IFN) is primarily involved in combating viral infections. However, emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that type-I IFN production within the tumor microenvironment can enhance anti-cancer immune activity and treatment outcomes. In line with this, several clinical trials have investigated the use of modified and recombinant type-I IFNs in acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia patients to prevent disease recurrence following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or post-remission therapy. Accumulation of cytosolic DNA can trigger the type-I IFN response via the cGAS-STING intracellular DNA-sensing pathway. While the use of IFN-alpha and STING agonists can elicit an anti-tumor immune response, their administration poses clinical challenges due to significant off-target toxicity and bioavailability issues. The release of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol can activate the type-I IFN response, but this aspect has not been explored in AML. Given that the leukemia-initiating cells in AML are known to have high mitochondrial activity and critically depend on oxidative phosphorylation, we hypothesized that targeting mitochondrial metabolism could activate STING signaling and the type-I IFN response in AML cells.
 Transcriptomic analysis of persisting AML cells post-induction therapy (cytarabine and doxorubicin) in an MLL-AF9 immune-competent C57BL/6 mouse model revealed that the persisting AML cells were negatively enriched for type-I IFN response and positively enriched for myc, oxidative phosphorylation, unfolded protein response and fatty acid metabolism. The bone marrow of mice with AML was enriched in exhausted CD8 and CD4 T cells and showed changes in NK cell subpopulations, indicating a dysfunctional immune microenvironment
 To understand the impact of mitochondrial metabolism on the type-I IFN response, we generated an ISRE (interferon stimulatory response element) luciferase-based reporter AML cell line (human MonoMac 6) to screen for mitochondria-targeting metabolic compounds that would potentially activate type-I IFN signaling. We discovered that Artesunate (ART; an anti-parasitic drug used to treat malaria), and Niclosamide (NA; an anti-helminthic drug used to manage tapeworm infections), elicited ISRE activity in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of STING, STAT1, and STAT2 (indicators of active type-I IFN signaling) was observed in the cells treated with ART but not with NA. To confirm that ISRE activation occurred through STING signaling, we used inhibitors H151 and GSK8612 in combination with ART and found that ISRE activation was prevented.
 A MitoStress Test confirmed that ART and NA significantly affect mitochondrial metabolism in AML cells. Treatment of AML cells with ART, NA, or the BH3 mimetic Venetoclax (mitochondrial inhibitor used in the management of AML) promoted the leakage of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol; however, only NA and ART increased the activation of IFN-stimulated genes, highlighting that not all mitochondria-targeting agents act in the same way.
 In vivo, ART (60mg/kg) effectively reduced the leukemic burden in an MLL-AF9 AML mouse model as a single agent, while the sequential administration of conventional iCT followed by ART further reduced AML progression and increased mouse survival.
 These findings show that altering the mitochondrial metabolism of AML cells can activate the type-I IFN response via the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway. We propose that ART can be repurposed as a potential STING agonist. Further studies are in progress to identify the effect of ART on immune cells in leukemic mice and test the use of ART as a STING agonist in different tumor models.

We made a novel conditional CD206 (Mrc1) knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete CD206+ TAMs. Early depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (Mono/Macs) led to the indirect loss of conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1), CD8 T cells, and NK cells in tumors. CD206+ TAMs robustly expressed CXCL9, contrasting with stress-responsive Spp1-expressing TAMs and immature monocytes, which became prominent with early depletion. CD206+ TAMs differentially attracted activated CD8 T cells, and the NK and CD8 T cells in CD206-depleted tumors were deficient in Cxcr3 and cDC1-supportive Xcl1 and Flt3l expressions. Disrupting this key antitumor axis decreased tumor control by antigen-specific T cells in mice. In human cancers, a CD206Replete, but not a CD206Depleted Mono/Mac gene signature correlated robustly with CD8 T cell, cDC1, and NK signatures and was associated with better survival. These findings negate the unqualified classification of CD206+ "M2-like" macrophages as immunosuppressive.">

 Immunotherapy trials in glioblastoma patients increasingly avoid immunosuppressive steroids and consider bevacizumab as alternative anti-edema treatment. Since VEGF is also a potent immunosuppressive factor, we explored the dimension and mechanisms of immune-mediated effects of anti-VEGF treatment. Murine glioma cells were injected intracerebrally into C57BL/6 wild-type mice or immunodeficient Pfp/Rag2 knockout mice and animals were treated with B20 (anti-murine VEGF) or dexamethasone. Immune cells were profiled by flow cytometry, and RNAseq was performed on sorted tumor and immune cells at different timepoints. B20 prolonged the survival of immunocompetent mice but not of Pfp/Rag2 knockout mice, indicating that the immune system is essential for its effect. At an early timepoint when controls became symptomatic, B20 “early” tumors (B20-ea) showed increased infiltration with T cells and myeloid cells, and decreased vascularization, whereas B20 tumors at the survival endpoint resembled IgG-controls. Gene expression in B20-ea tumor cells was dominated by hypoxia, neural development, invasion, TGF-β, Notch and Wnt signatures as well as concerted upregulation of Kmt2 H3K4 methyltransferases. In CD11b+ myeloid cells from B20-ea tumors, M1 hallmark genes and T cell activation genes were upregulated, while M2 genes were downregulated. Deconvolution revealed a transient shift towards pro-immune microglia/macrophages as well as increased NK cells and DCs. In CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, B20 increased the expression of S1pr1 and α/β TCR genes. The proportion of progenitor-like exhausted CD8+ cells, which are responsive to PD-1 blockade, was increased in B20-ea. In CD4+ cells, B20 caused skewing towards TFH, while dexamethasone increased TH2 cytokine expression. Depletion experiments demonstrated that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells but not NK cells were necessary for the survival-prolonging effect of B20. To conclude, anti-VEGF therapy has significant immunostimulatory effects which are, however, largely transient, so that an early treatment window of opportunity may exist during which it could actively support immunotherapy.">

 Introduction: Emerging evidence suggests that immune dysregulation drives resistance to cellular therapies. In particular, low CAR T-cell expansion and inferior patient outcomes have been associated with an inflamed immune milieu. Here, we investigated whether myeloid cells and serum proteomics are linked to T-cell dysfunction and treatment failure.
 Methods: Patients with r/r B-NHL who underwent treatment with axi-cel, brexu-cel, or tisa-cel in the third- or later-line setting were retrospectively included (n=74). Aliquots of EDTA-anticoagulated peripheral blood and serum were collected. Immune checkpoint (IC) expression (PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3) was assessed through flow cytometry before CAR T-cell infusion (time of leukapheresis, day -5 and day 0) as a surrogate for T-cell exhaustion. More specifically, the abundance of different co-expression profiles of ICs was compared and defined as non-exhausted (PD-1-TIM-3-LAG-3-), progenitor-exhausted (PD-1+TIM-3+LAG-3-), and terminally-exhausted (PD-1+TIM-3+LAG-3+). Using the Olink® Immuno-Oncology panel, 92 immune-related proteins were measured at day 0. A next-generation single-cell proteogenomics approach (BD RhapsodyTM) was applied to analyze the transcriptome of myeloid cells before and after infusion (day -5 and day 7). Responding patients (R, complete or partial remission) were compared to non-responding patients (NR, stable or progressive disease) according to 3-month (PET-) CT scans.
 Results: At baseline, NR showed lower frequencies of non-exhausted (apheresis, p = 0.025; day -5, p = 0.0236; day 0, p = 0.0496) and higher frequencies of terminally-exhausted T-cells (-5, p = 0.0053) compared to R. Interestingly, these surrogates for pre-existing T-cell dysfunction in NR were linked to an inflammatory state. Patients with low levels of non-exhausted T-cells also had higher levels of CRP (p = 0.0059), Ferritin (p = 0.0333), and LDH (p = 0.0268) compared to patients with high levels of non-exhausted T-cells before infusion.
 Network analysis correlating the abundance of immune-modulatory proteins with baseline IC expression on T cells revealed numerous connections for NR but merely associations for R, suggesting an impact of the serum protein milieu on IC expression in NR. We dissected these networks in terms of the degree centrality differences for the different proteins (i.e., the variations in the number of connections among the nodes between NR and R). While we identified a higher degree centrality for co-stimulatory proteins such as IL-18, CD8A and ICOSLG in R, we noted higher degree centrality for immune-inhibitory and tumor-related proteins such as CXC3L1, TNFRSF21, VEGFA and IL-6 in NR. Accordingly, we linked a higher abundance of CD8A and a lower abundance of TNFRSF21 and IL-6 to the frequency of non-exhausted T-cells at baseline using a linear regression model.
 Finally, we asked whether the myeloid compartment at baseline drives these differences in the serum protein milieu observed between NR and R. We identified four phenotypic and transcriptomic different monocytic and dendritic cell populations. Interestingly, two classical monocyte-like populations (CD14+CD16+HLA-DRlo) showed divergent population dynamics in NR but not R when assessing pre- and post-infusion time points. Notably, gene set enrichment analysis revealed an upregulation of immunosuppressive pathways, such as genes regulated by NF-KB in response to TNF, in several myeloid populations in NR but not R (classical monocyte-like 2, p < 0.0001; non-classical monocyte-like, p < 0.0001; DC-like, p = 0.0024). Surprisingly, monocytic populations in R revealed an upregulation of genes with immune stimulatory functions linked to responses to interferon-alpha or -gamma proteins (classical monocyte-like 1 and 2, p = 0.0058 and p = 0.0003; non-classical monocyte-like, p = 0.0003).
 Conclusion: These data suggest that CAR-T non-responders exhibit pre-existing T-cell dysfunction resulting from a systemic inflamed proteomic and cellular environment. Notably, the profound alterations within the myeloid compartment highlight diverging immune-modulating functions in non-responding and responding B-NHL patients. These findings set the further scope for scientific investigations not only to mitigate immune dysregulation but also to target the innate immune compartment for enhanced CAR T-cell responses.

 Background
 Bispecific T cell engager (TCE) therapy demonstrated promising efficacy in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL), but acquired resistance usually occurs. The mechanism of resistance of TCE immunotherapy is still not clear. Three different mechanisms have been hypothesized to result in TCE resistance. Many studies have shown the loss of antigen and the intrinsic T cell dysfunction may be responsible for TCE resistance. However, very limited studies suggested that the suppressive tumor microenvironment may contribute to TCE resistance in in-vitro assays and mouse models. No evidence has been shown in human patients yet.
 Methods
 The immune microenvironment of TCE-nonresponse or untreated B-NHL patients was characterized by single-cell RNA sequencing, high-dimensional flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry analyses. The cellular signaling that govern immune modulation were determined by tumor cell-immune cell co-culture assays with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor screening. Humanized B-NHL mouse models were established to determine the efficacy of TCE and combination treatments.
 Results
 We found immunosuppressive tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMs) were increased in tumor microenvironment of relapse patients post-TCE therapy. Depletion of TAMs synergistically enhanced TCE anti-tumor efficacy in a humanized mouse tumor model. By screening a kinase inhibitors library of 533 small molecule compounds in our co-culture system, we discovered the kinase inhibitors could boost T cell cytotoxicity against B cell lymphoma cells which was impaired by TAMs and decrease the IL-4-induced CD163 expression on TAMs. BTK inhibitors were the most effective drug in both up-regulated the relative cell death and downregulated relative CD163 MFI of macrophages with statistical significance among those screened tyrosine kinase inhibitors. According to KEGG analysis, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was the top enriched pathway downregulated in BTKi-treated or BTK-knockout macrophages, and a C-type lectin transmembrane protein, CD93, was one of the intriguing genes, which was downregulated by kinase inhibitors involved MAPK and PKC signaling. Moreover, we indeed identified BTK signaling and its downstream molecule CD93 in TAMs promoted T cell suppression. TCE-engaged cytotoxic T cells recruited monocytes and macrophages from the circulation to tumor via a chemokine receptor, CCR5, that in turn promote CD93 expression through the activation of BTK signaling. TCE-engaged T cells also secreted IGFBP7 that binds and activates CD93 on TAMs. Both BTK signaling and its downstream molecule CD93 in TAMs could contribute to T cell suppression. BTK inhibition or CD93 blockade dramatically increased TCE anti-tumor efficacy. Furthermore, we found CD93 is critical for the immunosuppressive function of TAMs in various solid tumors.
 Conclusion
 In summary, our results suggest that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a major cause of TCE resistance for B-NHL patients and a novel myeloid checkpoint, CD93, might be a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell (PC) malignancy characterized by a high tendency to relapse and develop drug resistance. In this context, immune dysregulation is a defining characteristic of MM, with interactions between malignant PCs and immune cells within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment playing a crucial role in creating a tumor-promoting environment. Recently, therapeutic strategies have shown promise to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and activate the host immune system.
 Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are an emerging class of immunotherapy, exploiting tumor-specific oncolysis and generating a robust anti-tumor immune response. Several OVs have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical MM studies, with some undergoing early clinical trials. However, many of these viruses are of human origin, limiting their use due to pre-existing humoral immunity and/or potential pathogenicity. To overcome these issues, non-human OVs that are not pathogenic to humans are being considered. To date, it is known that Bovine Herpes Virus Type 1 (BoHV-1) has antitumor activity in several solid tumors, but its efficacy in hematological malignancies is unknown. Indeed, this study aims to explore the BoHV-1 direct oncolytic effect on MM cells and the putative indirect stimulation of the immune cells in an ex vivo setting.
 Firstly, by flow cytometry, we confirmed that human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), JJN3 and MM1.S expressed high levels of the putative cellular receptors for BoHV-1 entry (CD111, CD155, and CD138). Moreover, the direct oncolytic effect of BoHV-1 was assessed on the same HMCLs after 24, 48, and 72h of treatment at 1 and 2 multiplicity of infection (MOI). Flow cytometry analysis on HMCLs treated with BoHV-1 showed a significant increase in cell mortality, as a percentage of 7-AAD+ cells, and in the expression of Apo2.7, an apoptotic marker, after 48 and 72h. Additionally, it was found that the BoHV-1 treatment of HMCLs led to caspase-3 activation by western blot analysis. Next, we conducted an ex vivo study to investigate the effect of BoHV-1 treatment on BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) from a cohort of newly diagnosed (N=15) and relapsed/refractory MM patients (N=7). The preliminary analysis of BoHV-1 entry receptors on primary MM PCs confirmed their expression by all patients' PCs, although with notable heterogeneity in expression level. In parallel, the patients' BM MNCs were treated with BoHV-1 at 1 and 2 MOI for 48, 72, and 96h. At each time point, flow cytometry analysis showed a significant decrease in viable CD138+CD38+ MM PCs among virus-treated compared with untreated BM MNCs.
 Secondly, the role of immune effector cells in enhancing the efficacy of BoHV-1 oncolytic therapy in MM cells was evaluated. In vitro, JJN3 cells were pre-treated with BoHV-1 for 24h, after virus removal, a 4h cytotoxicity assay was performed in a co-culture with NK-92, a stabilized human natural killer cell line. We found that BoHV-1 pre-treatment markedly enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells against JJN3. Moreover, ex vivo, we investigated how the BoHV-1 treatment impacts the immune microenvironment cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that BoHV-1-treated BM MNCs exhibited a significant increase in the expression of CD107a, a degranulation marker, on NK cells and a significant upregulation of CD69 expression on NK, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes. Interestingly, BoHV-1 treatment induced a switch in monocyte polarization from an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype (CD14+CD16+) to a pro-inflammatory and anti-tumoral M1 phenotype (CD14+CD16-). Furthermore, throughout the BoHV-1 treatment, there was a significant upregulation of CD38 expression, observed not only in all main immune cell subsets but also in MM PCs. Based on this finding, we evaluated the efficacy of the CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody, daratumumab, on patients' BM MNCs pre-treated for 48h with the virus. The results demonstrated that the combination of BoHV-1 treatment and daratumumab led to a statistically significant reduction in the MM PCs viability compared to the effects of either treatment alone.
 Overall, our data highlight that BoHV-1 not only exerts direct cytotoxic effects on MM cells but also reshapes the immune microenvironment modulating the surrounding immune landscape. These findings suggest its potential as a novel alternative anti-MM virotherapy strategy, either alone or in combination with immunotherapeutic drugs.

 Background:
 Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enhanced our understanding of the immunological dysfunctions during multiple myeloma (MM) progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering MM (SMM). Immunotherapies employing T cells have demonstrated promise in treating MM. However, a better understanding of effector T cells is necessary due to their limited response durability. While most forms of cancer immunotherapy have primarily focused on CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), CD4+ T cells are emerging as important contributors to antitumor responses beyond their traditional roles as helpers or regulators. However, the specific subset of CD4+ T cells contributing to beneficial outcomes in MM remains unclear, and it is unknown whether CD4+ T cells mediate direct antitumor effector functions against myeloma cells.
 Aims:
 This study aims to characterize CD4+ CTLs in MM by investigating their phenotypic and functional properties, assessing their impact on patient outcomes, and identifying their mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
 Methods:
 We performed scRNA-seq and TCR-seq on CD4+ T cells sorted from bone marrow (BM) aspirates of 29 individuals across different stages of myeloma, including healthy donors (n=5) and patients with MGUS (n=4), SMM (n=4), and MM (n=16). We validated the identified subsets and further characterize their immunophenotype by multicolor flow cytometry, while cytotoxicity assays and blocking experiments evaluated their cytotoxic capabilities.
 Results:
 Droplet-based scRNA-seq and paired scTCR-seq were performed to infer the functional states of BM CD4+ T cells, and a total of 105,398 CD4+ T cells were obtained from 29 individuals using the 10X Genomic platform. By unsupervised clustering, we identified 14 distinct BM CD4+ T cell subsets: naive (CCR7+TCF7+FAS-HNRNPLL-), early activated (early.act, CCR7+TCF7+FAS-NR4A1+), central memory (CM, CCR7+FAS+), follicular helper T (Tfh, CXCR5+BCL6+), Th2 (GATA3+CCR4+), Th17 (RORC+CCR6+), Th1 (TBX21+CXCR3+IFNG+), two subsets of regulatory T cells (Treg, FOXP3+CTLA4+), resting Tregs (rTreg, CCR7+) and activated Treg (aTreg, HLA-DRA+TNFRSF9+), IFN-stimulated genes-enriched (ISGshi, OAS3+IRF7+), and activated and proliferating (act.proli, MKI67+CD38+). Of note, we identified two distinct states of BM CD4+ T subsets that highly express cytolytic effector molecules: cells expressing GZMB and cells expressing GZMK. The GZMB-expressing subset exhibited high levels of a core set of cytotoxic molecules (GZMA+NKG7+GNLY+PRF1+) and markers associated with terminal differentiation (B3GAT1+KLRG1+CD27-), which was designated as terminal effector CTL (TE.CTL). In contrast, the GZMK-expressing subset had lower levels of cytolytic molecules and instead demonstrated higher expression of Th1 or Th17 signature genes, and we clustered these subsets as Th1.CTL and Th17.CTL, respectively. Importantly, TE.CTL cluster was significantly increased and clonally expanded in MM patients. When we combined CTL clusters and their TCR clonotype-sharing clusters, we identified a major fraction of these cells as CX3CR1hi cells, which exhibited higher expression of cytotoxic markers such as CX3CR1, KLRK1 (NKG2D), SLAMF7 (CD319), ITGB1 (CD29), ADGRG1 (GPR56). Flow cytometry revealed the effector memory phenotype of CD4+ CTLs and their robust production of perforin and degranulation upon stimulation. Functional assays demonstrated that CD4+ CTLs could directly kill myeloma cells ex vivo, with this cytotoxicity significantly reduced by NKG2D blockade, indicating an NKG2D-dependent mechanism. Patients with a higher frequency of NKG2D+CD4+ CTLs in their BM showed improved progression-free survival, underscoring their clinical relevance.
 Conclusions:
 CD4+ CTLs are important players in the antitumor immunity of MM. They are increased in frequency, clonally expanded, and possess robust cytotoxic capabilities and the abundance of NKG2D+CD4+ CTLs correlate with improved clinical outcomes. The NKG2D dependency of their cytotoxic function presents a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Harnessing CD4+ CTLs offers a promising strategy for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes in MM, paving the way for the development of novel CD4+ CTL-based therapies and better prediction of treatment responses by monitoring NKG2D+CD4+ CTLs.

        <tr id="Background IFN-γ+CD4+ cells (type 1 helper T cells, Th1) represent a critical component of the inflammatory environment in the lungs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Identifying influencing factors related to COPD-associated Th1 cells will enhance our understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms involved and facilitate the development of targeted interventions. Method We describe T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim3) as a key gene regulating COPD-associated Th1 cells through single-cell sequencing, flow cytometry and knockout mice. Results Our findings indicate that Havcr2 expression gradually increases during CD4+ T cell activation in COPD mice, with Tim3 being highly expressed on both CD4+ T cells and Th1 cells. Notably, the knockout of HAVCR2 further promotes the infiltration of CD4+ T cells and the expression of IFN-γ in the lungs, resulting in a more severe emphysema phenotype, although it does not significantly affect TNF-α expression. Additionally, NFIL3, an upstream regulator of Tim3, is also highly expressed in the CD4+ T cells of COPD mice. Mice with NFIL3 knockout exhibit phenotypes similar to those of HAVCR2 knockout mice, along with a significant downregulation of Tim3 expression. In vitro, we simulated the activation process by polarizing primary CD4+ Tn cells from COPD mice and observed that NFIL3/Tim3 expression was significantly upregulated following Th1 polarization. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that the NFIL3/Tim3 axis plays a role in Th1 imbalance in the lungs of COPD by inhibiting Th1 differentiation.">

        <tr id="T-lymphopenia (TLP) is a frequently observed condition in cancer patients, often exacerbated by conventional chemo/radiotherapy, which impairs the efficacy of subsequent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. This study aimed to understand the impact of TLP on ICB responsiveness and explore potential therapeutic strategies to enhance antitumor immunity.To investigate ICB responsiveness depending on the severity of TLP, first, we established TLP mouse models that mimic clinically observed mild and severe TLP through thymectomy and anti-Thy1-induced peripheral T cell depletion. T cell-replete mice and T-lymphopenic mice were inoculated with palpable or advanced tumors to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy according to the severity of TLP. Additionally, by utilizing established murine models, we analyzed matched blood, tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and tumor samples by flow cytometry to investigate the mechanisms by which ICB responsiveness is impaired under T-lymphopenic conditions. Finally, to evaluate the combination effect of anti-PD-1 and recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc) in T-lymphopenic conditions, we administered anti-PD-1, rhIL-7-hyFc, or both to advanced tumor-bearing T-lymphopenic mice and subsequently analyzed tumor growth and survival rates.Using mouse models mimicking clinical TLP, we observed that the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy was severely impaired in TLP, depending on the degree of TLP and the immunogenicity of the tumors. TLP mice showed a significant reduction in systemic CD8 T cells but stable intratumoral CD8 T cell numbers, suggesting maintained tumor infiltration despite systemic downregulation. Crucially, TLP led to a shift in the composition of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with a decrease in PD-1+ tumor-reactive CD8 T cells and an increase in PD-1− bystander cells. This reduction in PD-1+ cells was linked to impaired clonal expansion in tumor-draining lymph nodes. To counteract these effects, we introduced recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc), which effectively restored systemic T cell counts, enhanced PD-1+ CD8 T cell proliferation within tumors, and increased the population of stem-like progenitor cells. The combination of rhIL-7-hyFc and anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in significant tumor regression and improved mouse survival.Our findings highlight the critical role of IL-7 in reshaping the CD8 T cell landscape to improve ICB efficacy in TLP conditions, proposing a sequential therapeutic approach: conventional therapy to reduce tumor burden and enhance immunogenicity, followed by IL-7 therapy to restore and rejuvenate CD8 T cells, culminating in effective ICB treatment.">

        <tr id="The dialogue between T and B cells can be regulated by different mechanisms, such as co-inhibitory receptors, which therefore play a crucial role in preventing autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on many myeloid and lymphoid cells. Although peripheral B cells express a very high amount of BTLA, previous works in the context of autoimmunity mainly focused on T cells, and whether BTLA expression on B cells plays a role in the lupus pathogenesis is still unclear. In the present study, we examine the expression of BTLA, as well as its ligand HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator), on various B cell subsets in lupus patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). We evidenced the existence of double-negative (DN; IgD−CD27−) memory B cells expressing very low levels of BTLA, which are enhanced in active lupus patients. An in-depth analysis revealed that these BTLAlow DN cells mainly correspond to the newly reported DN3 B cell subset, originally described in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection. These cells display an activated and antibody-secreting cell phenotype, and we propose that their low BTLA expression may favor their expansion and rapid differentiation into plasmablasts in lupus patients.">

        <tr id="Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature, immune suppressive myeloid cells. However, their role in periodontal disease (PD), a microbially induced inflammatory oral disease, remains understudied. Here we show that gingiva (gums) from PD patients exhibit significantly higher levels of MDSC markers including Granulocytic (G)-MDSC and Monocytic (M)-MDSC subsets as well as CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells. Gingival MDSC subsets exhibit potent immunoregulatory activity as marked by attenuated autologous CD4+ T cells proliferation and IFNγ production. In a murine model of ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP), we noticed time-dependent gingival MDSC infiltration, which correlates with CD4+ T cell and CD19+ B cell infiltration. To test whether MDSC confer immunoregulatory function in vivo, we adoptively transferred G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in mice. Interestingly, we observed significant reduction in inflammatory marker expression (IL6, TNF-α, and IL-1β), infiltration of CD4+ T cells, and concomitant increase in MDSC-derived immune suppressive molecules, ARG1 and IL-10, and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs compared to mock. Conversely, depletion of MDSC using anti-Gr1 antibody resulted in marked induction of periodontal inflammation, reduced Treg population, and significantly higher alveolar bone loss. These findings, for the first time, suggest an anti-inflammatory and osteoprotective function of MDSCs in PD and offer a promising target to treat unresolved periodontal inflammation.">

 TCR-T cell therapy using T cells engineered to express high-affinity receptors targeting Wilms Tumor Antigen1 (WT1), known as TTCR-C4, has shown promising results in the treatment of AML (Chapuis A et al., Nat Med 2019). However, immune-escape of tumor cells remains one of the biggest obstacles to successful cell therapy.
 We previously described, a mechanism of immune escape characterized by a change in the proteosomal machinery compromising antigen presentation (Lahman M et al., Sci Transl Med 2022). Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to study a patient exhibiting long-term (> 100 days post-infusion) TTCR-C4 persistence who experienced relapse post-infusion. Leveraging the sex mismatch between the male donor and female recipient, we tracked the transcriptome of blasts before infusion and at relapse. Specifically, we used the female-specific gene XIST and the male-specific gene RPS4Y1 and employed the marker-based purification algorithm scGate (Andreatta M et al., Bioinformatics 2022) to precisely identify the blasts. Furthermore, we identified healthy myeloid cells, endogenous CD8+ T cells, and TTCR-C4 cells.
 In line with clinical reports, blasts were detected before TTCR-C4 infusion and at day 178 post-infusion. Notably, the number of TTCR-C4 progressively declined from day 21 to day 178. Further analysis of TTCR-C4 transcriptional changes revealed the expression of genes associated with mitochondrial fitness and energy production at day 178, suggesting activation of the mitochondrial machinery in response to the presence of blasts. TTCR-C4 cell gene-set variation analysis showed persistence of immune-response (interferon-gamma response) and mitochondrial activity (oxidative phosphorylation) but also revealed enriched signatures of apoptosis, hypoxia, and inflammation at day 178. These findings suggested that although TTCR-C4 could mount an immune response against the blasts, a potential change in leukemia hampered their response and induced TTCR-C4 apoptosis and decline.
 Further examination of the blasts' transcriptomes before infusion and at day 178 showed that blasts skewed towards a monocytic phenotype, expressing markers such as CD14, CCR2, and ITGAM. Prior studies (Van Galen et al., Cell 2019) have indicated that AML monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) skewing can impair T-cell responses and promote leukemic cell survival. Our analysis revealed higher expression of most MDSC genes at day 178 compared to the pre-infusion timepoint, indicating a skewing of blasts towards an MDSC phenotype. To further support these findings, we analyzed an independent bulk-RNAseq dataset from diagnostic samples of the BeatAML2 cohort (Bottomly et al., Cancer Cell 2022). Using a manually curated gene signature of monocytic MDSCs, we employed a Cox's proportional hazard model with lasso penalty to select informative genes. The resulting gene signature score, consisting of nine genes involved in mechanisms of immunosuppression and tumor survival, predicted overall survival, consistent with previous data indicating that MDSC genes adversely affect overall survival in AML patients.
 Finally, we explored in-vitro strategies to control this mechanism of escape using a TCR with higher affinity for WT1 compared to TTCR-C4, and using engineered CD4 and CD8 against the same target (WT1).
 In conclusion, this case report highlights the skewing of AML blasts towards a monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell phenotype as a potential mechanism of immune escape. The findings underscore the need for more potent cell therapies able to prevent immune-escape and address blast heterogeneity.

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, triggers a complex immune response, with T regulatory cells (Tregs) playing a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. The current study investigates the function of T regulatory cells during COVID-19 infection and the subsequent recovery period, emphasizing their impact on immune regulation and inflammation control. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Treg subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients at different stages: acute infection, early convalescence, and long-term recovery. Flow cytometry was employed to quantify Tregs including “naïve”, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector cells (TEMRA). Additionally, the functional state of the Tregs was assessed by the expression of purinergic signaling molecules (CD39, CD73). Cytokine profiles were assessed through multiplex analysis. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in the number of Tregs during the acute phase of COVID-19, which correlates with heightened inflammatory markers and increased disease severity. Specifically, we found a decrease in the relative numbers of “naïve” and an increase in EM Tregs, as well as a decrease in the absolute numbers of “naïve” and CM Tregs. During the early convalescent period, the absolute counts of all Treg populations tended to increase, accompanied by a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite this, one year after recovery, the decreased subpopulations of regulatory T cells had not yet reached the levels observed in healthy donors. Finally, we observed the re-establishment of CD39 expression in all Treg subsets; however, there was no change in CD73 expression among Tregs. Understanding these immunological changes across different T regulatory subsets and adenosine signaling pathways offers important insights into the disease’s pathogenesis and provides a broader view of immune system dynamics during recovery.">

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies induce durable responses in many patients with hematological malignancies. However, these therapies are associated with unique and significant toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), with grade 3-4 ICANS occurring in up to 30% of patients. The pathophysiology of ICANS is poorly understood with evidence suggesting elevation of cytokines, notably IFNϒ and GM-CSF, resulting in innate myeloid cell hyperactivation. Blood biomarkers for ICANS show group differences but are largely non predictive. Furthermore, there are no characteristic radiographic features in patients with ICANS. Developing a non-invasive strategy for earlier detection and monitoring treatment responses is paramount and provides an opportunity for earlier intervention using approved and emerging therapies. Recently, we reported the synthesis and validation of 4-[18F]fluoro-1-naphthol ([18F]4FN), a novel redox tuned radiotracer for selective imaging of high redox potential reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) by positron emission tomography (PET), thus interrogating the activation state of innate immunity [Nature Biotechnology, 2022]. Leveraging non-invasive imaging of RONS bursts we aim to unravel underlying biological mechanisms and test novel therapeutic interventions in models of ICANS.
 First, we sought to identify key effector cell types and their biochemical co-correlates that could be used to stratify outcomes or interventions. To study the role of activated innate immune cells in a co-culture assay, we polarized THP-1 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells to an activated macrophage-like state, as well as autologous CAR T-cells manufactured from healthy donors and incubated with L-012, a bioluminescent reporter of high energy RONS. The kinetics and dynamic activation of the innate immune system was evaluated in a humanized B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia mouse model of ICANS by bioluminescence imaging. Media and peripheral blood were collected for cytokine analysis from in cellulo and in vivo experiments. Representative sections of mouse brains were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
 In vitro experiments demonstrated that polarized M1 macrophage-like THP-1 cells that were activated with PMA and incubated with L-012, resulted in 3 orders of magnitude enhancement in RONS-generated bioluminescent signal. Similarly, CAR T-cell coculture assays with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed a 30-fold increase in bioluminescence, which was significantly reduced upon monocyte depletion. Cytokine analysis confirmed elevation in monocyte-derived cytokines and a correlation with L-012 bioluminescence (e.g. Spearman's correlation 0.97, L-012 vs IL-1). Importantly peak bioluminescence preceded all peak cytokine response. Similarly, humanized ICANS mouse models demonstrated significantly higher central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory hotspots following CAR T-cell administration at day +1 and up to day +3 post CAR T-cell therapy. CNS enhancement was also observed in non-tumor bearing humanized mice treated with CAR T-cells. Very low luminescence was detected in non-humanized mice and was comparable to control groups. Cytokine analysis performed on peripheral blood at day +3 post CAR T-cell therapy also revealed elevations in GM-CSF, IL-1B, IL-6. IHC demonstrated infiltration of innate immune myeloid cells in the CNS compared to control groups.
 Finally, we validated the use of [18F]4FN in a cohort of patients enrolled in our phase I first-in-human study. First-in-human pharmacokinetic and dosimetry analysis for [18F]4FN confirmed a whole body effective dose 16 +/- 1.9 µSv/MBq, and no serious attributed adverse events were observed. Importantly [18F]4FN lacked retention in patients without CNS inflammation, a PET radiotracer property optimal for imaging inflammatory conditions within the CNS.
 In conclusion, RONS activity using L-012 was dependent on monocytes in co-culture assays and CNS inflammatory hotspots were observed in humanized mice following CAR T-cell therapy. These preliminary findings provide a rationale for investigating [18F]4FN PET as a possible translational biomarker of ICANS, and a validated platform where modulators of RONS respiratory bursts can be evaluated as potent therapeutics for ICANS.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that can rapidly mount a response to their targets by employing diverse mechanisms. Due to their functional attributes, NK cells have been implicated in anti-viral and anti-tumour immune responses. Although traditionally known to mount non-specific, rapid immune responses, in recent years, the notion of memory NK cells with adaptive features has gained more recognition. Memory NK cells emerge in response to different stimuli, such as viral antigens and specific cytokine combinations. They form distinct populations, accompanied by transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in unique phenotypic and functional attributes. Several clinical trials are testing the efficacy of memory NK cells due to their enhanced functionality, bioenergetic profile and persistence in vivo. The therapeutic potential of NK cells is being harnessed in viral infections, with wider applications in the cancer field.

 Introduction:
 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common form of leukemia in the US, is characterized by the proliferation of malignant B-cells that exert immunosuppressive effects through complex, partially understood mechanisms. Immunosuppression in CLL leads to increased risk of secondary malignancies, opportunistic infections, and treatment failure to T-cell based immunotherapies (e.g. chimeric antigen receptor T-cells [CART]). Venetoclax (Ven) is a highly effective BCL2 inhibitor that promotes apoptosis in CLL cells and may enhance T-cell function.
 Methods:
 Peripheral blood (plasma & peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]) specimens and clinicopathologic data from 13 consented patients (BDR-164122) with CLL initiating treatment with Ven were prospectively collected at baseline (D0) and after Ven ramp up at 30 days post-treatment (D30). Specimens were analyzed via flow cytometry (FC, including T-cell subsets and exhaustion markers), RNA sequencing (on both PBMC, [PB-RNAseq] and T-cells separated by negative selection [TcRNAseq]), Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS), and a Biocrates MxP Quant 500 XL metabolomic panel. Comparative multiomic analysis was performed using machine learning and bioinformatics tools (including R, CIBERSORTx, & NIH-DAVID) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), methylated regions (DMRs), and regulated metabolites were analyzed.
 CAR T-cells (anti-CD19 scFv, CD28 transmembrane/intracellular signaling domain, TCR ζ-chain signaling domain, lentiviral vector) were manufactured at both D0 and D30 (N=5) with transduction efficiency evaluated by FC. Cytotoxicity against Luciferase transfected Raji cells (Raji-Luc) was measured.
 Results:
 All but 1 patient had bulky disease prior to D0, and 12 patients were successfully de-bulked prior to D30 (7 with Ven alone, and 6 with Ven and an anti-CD20 antibody). Post-treatment D30 flow cytometry revealed an increase in CD8+ T-cell frequency, as well as CD8+ TStem Cell Memory (TSCM) and Tnaïve (TN) memory cell subsets. D30 TcRNAseq correspondingly revealed significant upregulation of genes important for CD8+ and CD4+ memory T cell (TIMP2, CPEB3) and CD8+ memory development (PRKCZ). TcRNAseq DEG analysis revealed significant upregulation of genes involved in both T-cell activation/survival (TNFSF13B, ZDHHC21, VAV3) and negative regulators of T-regulatory cell (TReg) development and enhanced ferroptosis (ALOX5).
 PB-RNAseq revealed significant post-treatment upregulation of DEGs governing M1 macrophage polarization (TLR4), monocyte/macrophage differentiation markers (CD68, CD163, CCR1, CSF1, IL32), neutrophil migration (CXCR2), and neutrophil chemoattraction (CXCL8), as well as T-cell inflammatory cytokine production and cytotoxic function (GZMB, GZMK, TNFAIP2). CIBERSORTx immune cell deconvolution clustering correlated with FC, and revealed 3 transcriptomic subgroups that mirrored treatment responses (% change in circulating CLL cells), with better responders having 1698 positively expressed DEGs associated with T-cell activation (ITK, CD4, CD8A, CD8B, CD28) and cytokine signaling (IL7, EREG, CSF1R, CCR2).
 Metabolomic analyses revealed that lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine were significantly increased in D30 plasma, while spermine, spermidine (known to polarize CD4+ T-cells to TReg), taurine, and glutamate plasma concentrations decreased at D30. The most hypermethylated D30 DMRs by RRBS were GFI1B, ALOXE3, HLA-DOA, and PRDM16 while KCNB1 and TMEM275 were the most hypomethylated D30 DMRs.
 D0 CART had noticeably impaired post-transduction CART expansion compared with D30 post-Ven CART. Enhanced CART cytotoxicity was observed at D30 post-Ven in 3 of 5 patients by Raji-Luc cytotoxicity assays, relative to intra-patient D0 CART.
 Conclusions:
 One month of Ven treatment and de-bulking of CLL cells was found to significantly enhance immune cell activation and function. Upregulation of genes and associated phenotypic changes that correlate with improved cytotoxicity with CART (e.g. TSCM and TN T-cell subsets) were observed, as were pro-inflammatory changes in innate immune cells (e.g. M1 macrophage polarization). Some of these changes appear to be metabolically regulated. Our findings suggest Ven enhances CART cytotoxicity and T-cell function, which warrants further translational validation.

        <tr id="Increasing evidence highlights the importance of immune mechanoregulation in establishing and sustaining tumor-specific cytotoxicity required for desirable immunotherapeutic outcomes. However, the molecular connections between mechanobiological inputs and outputs and the designated immune activities remain largely unclear. Here, we show that partial inhibition of non-muscle myosin II (NM II) augmented the traction force exerted by T cells and potentiated T cell cytotoxicity against tumors. By using T cells from mice and patients with cancer, we found that NM II is required for the activity of NKX3-2 in maintaining the expression of ADGRB3, which shapes the filamentous actin (F-actin) organization and ultimately attributes to the reduced traction force of T cells in the tumor microenvironment. In animal models, suppressing the NM II–NKX3-2–ADGRB3 pathway in T cells effectively suppressed tumor growth and improved the efficacy of the checkpoint-specific immunotherapy. Overall, this work provides insights into the biomechanical regulation of T cell cytotoxicity that can be exploited to optimize clinical immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Overcoming immune suppression is a major barrier to eliciting potent CD8+ T cell responses against cancer. Treatment with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody is an effective means for eliminating CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg) cells in preclinical models and has also demonstrated efficacy in early clinical trials. However, the underlying basis for treatment efficacy, more specifically the implications of codepleting other CD4-expressing cell compartments in tumor-bearing hosts, is not well understood. Methods Tumor-bearing mice were treated with anti-CD4 versus other therapies that preserve helper T cell function, and the priming, tissue distribution, and maintenance of tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells were assessed. Antibody blockade and transgenic mouse models were used to determine the mechanisms of CD8 T cell priming. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) was used to further characterize CD8 T cells that are primed by anti-CD4 therapy and to identify immunosuppressive CD4 T cell subsets in human melanoma following immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Results Comparing anti-CD4 to dual ICB therapy, we show that anti-CD4 facilitates more robust priming of TCF-1+, IL-2-producing, tumor-specific CD8+ T cells that disseminate to tissues and form memory. By decoupling priming from homeostatic proliferation and associated cytokines, we find that anti-CD4 functions independently of creating homeostatic space for CD8+ T cells. We also show that depletion of CD4-expressing antigen-presenting cell subsets is not required for anti-CD4 efficacy. Instead, robust tumor-specific CD8+ T cell priming and memory generation required the removal of total antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, including both Tregs and CD4+ Foxp3-negative conventional (Tconv) cells. In particular, the elimination of CD4+ Tconv cells was necessary for the accumulation and maturation of conventional type-1 dendritic cells in tumor-draining LNs, which were required for CD8+ T cell priming. Accordingly, anti-CD4 treatment restored CD8+ T cell responses in mice cotreated with dual ICB. scRNAseq of melanoma tumors from patients who received ICB revealed the presence of Tr1 and Treg subsets, as well as CD4+ Tconv subsets that lacked clear transcriptional evidence of helper differentiation. Conclusions These findings underscore the underappreciated benefit of depleting CD4+ Tconv cells to promote systemic primary and memory CD8+ T cell responses against cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma patients reside in the bone marrow and continuously interact with local immune cells. Progression and therapy response are influenced by this immune environment, highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of endogenous immune responses to malignant plasma cells. Here we used the 5TGM1 murine transfer model of multiple myeloma to dissect early immune responses to myeloma cells. We modeled stable and progressive disease by transferring 5TGM1 murine myeloma cells into C57Bl/6 mice and KaLwRij mice, respectively. We used flow cytometry and single‐cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses to characterize differential immune responses in stable and progressive disease. Transfer of 5TGM1 cells in C57Bl/6 mice led to stable disease with low tumor burden in a subset of animals. Stable disease was associated with sustained activation and expansion of NK cells, ILC1, and CD8+ T cells, a response that was lost upon disease progression. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing of immune cells and bulk RNA sequencing of immune and mesenchymal stromal cells implicated the activation of interferon responses as a central immune pathway during stable disease. Experimentally, neutralization of IFNγ significantly increased myeloma development and progression in C57Bl/6 mice, testifying to the importance of this pathway in early disease control. In conclusion, we provide a framework for studying immune responses to multiple myeloma progression in immunocompetent and genetically modifiable mice and highlight the importance of bone marrow immunity in tumor control.">

It is a highly plastic process that secures the response to external and internal stimuli to face acute and changing needs. Infections and chronic diseases including cancer can modulate it by producing several factors, impacting proliferation and differentiation programs. While the lymphocytic compartment has attracted major attention due to the role of adaptive immunity in anticancer immune response, in recent years, research has found convincing evidence that confirms the importance of innate immunity and the key function played by emergency myelopoiesis.

        <tr id="During chronic infection or tumorigenesis, persistent antigen stimulation contributes to the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, exhausted CD8+ T (TEX) cells still preserve certain effector function, and maintaining a reservoir of exhausted cells is of vital importance for virus elimination and tumor eradiation. Despite considerable work interrogating the rejuvenation of TEX cells, mechanisms underpinning the clonal deletion of TEX cells remain largely unexplored over the past decade. In this study, we employed mouse models of LCMV infection to demonstrate that excessive accumulation of lipid peroxidation rendered virus-specific TEX cells to ferroptosis, which may correlate with enhanced mitochondria-derived oxidative stress and compromised activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). In addition, either incomplete or complete ablation of GPX4 resulted in exacerbated ferroptosis and aggravated shrunken population of virus-specific TEX cells. On the other hand, inhibiting ferroptosis via administration of a ferroptosis inhibitor or overexpression of GPX4 greatly rectified the cell loss of virus-specific TEX cells. Collectively, we disclosed ferroptosis as a crucial player in the clonal deletion of virus-specific TEX cells and stressed the intervention of ferroptosis as a promising approach to optimize the longevity of virus-specific TEX cells.">

 CD74, a chaperone associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), plays a crucial role in assembling and transporting MHC-II molecules on the cellular surface. Beyond its physiological function in antigen presentation, CD74 is a negative regulator of inflammation, and its dysregulation is associated with inflammatory disorders and cancer. Notably, tumor stem cells release macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to trigger CD74 immunosuppressive signaling in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, thereby abrogating CD8+ T cell activation and promoting angiogenesis. While CD74 expression is known in dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, our recent findings reveal its upregulation in immunosuppressive macrophages within the low-grade glioma (LGG) tumor microenvironment, and its negative correlation with the survival of adolescent and young adult patients with LGG. HYPOTHESIS. We hypothesize that inhibiting CD74/MIF in immunosuppressive myeloid cells may affect tumor progression and prevent malignant transformation (MT) to high-grade glioma (HGG).



 To test our hypothesis, we isolated bone marrow cells from immunocompetent RCAS n/tv-a LGG bearing animals, differentiated them into bone marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDMs), silenced CD74 expression, and co-cultured them with primary CD8+T cells. Moreover, we inhibited CD74/MIF signaling in vivo. RESULTS. Deconvolution analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells revealed upregulation of CD74 and its network in myeloid cells during LGG compared to HGG. Silencing CD74 in LGG BMDMs in vitro resulted in the downregulation of genes associated with migration, proliferation, and immunosuppression. The co-culture of LGG CD74KD-BMDMs with CD8+ T cells increased the expression of T cell activation genes. In vivo treatment of LGG mice with MIF inhibitors significantly decreased myeloid cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and prolonged survival.



 These preclinical studies highlight a role for the CD74/MIF signaling axis in glioma and present a novel immunotherapeutic target to modulate the activity of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in order to delay MT.

 Introduction: Inflammation resolution is an active process driven by endogenous molecules, such as the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), that limit cell recruitment, dampen inflammatory signaling, remove dead cells (i.e. efferocytosis), and promote tissue repair. Impaired resolution results in chronic inflammation, which is an essential driver of many diseases from autoimmunity to cardiovascular disease. Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a fatal form of bone marrow failure (BMF) characterized by severe pancytopenia and persistent inflammation. It is well-understood that autoreactive T cells mediate the destruction of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during SAA, however the underlying mechanisms that lead to persistent inflammation are unknown. In this study, we aim to define mechanisms responsible for chronic inflammation in SAA and determine the efficacy of SPM treatment as a novel therapeutic approach.
 Methods: To induce BMF, CByB6F1 (H-2b/d) received a sub-lethal dose of radiation (300 RADS) and an intraperitoneal injection of 6.5x107 splenocytes from MHC-mismatched C57BL/6 (H-2b/b) mice. Mice that received only sub-lethal radiation were used as controls. 250 ng Resolvin E1 was administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection every other day, starting day 7. Mice were sacrificed at day 8, 10, 12, and 14 or left for survival studies. Peripheral blood, hind limbs, pelvis, and sternum were harvested at each timepoint. Peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) cells were used for immunophenotyping via flow cytometry. Lipids from the pelvis were extracted and analyzed via LC/MS. Sort-purified BM monocytes or total BM was analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using 10X Genomics and the Seurat pipeline. A human scRNAseq BM dataset (GSE181989) was also analyzed.
 Results: Despite an expansion of professional phagocytes (i.e. monocytes and macrophages), SAA mice exhibited a 3-fold increase (7.8% to 23.1%) in dead cells in the BM, compared to radiation control. Efferocytosis, as measured by the uptake of fluorescently-labeled dead cells, was significantly reduced during SAA. MerTK is a cell-surface receptor on phagocytes that mediates efferocytosis. Under inflammatory conditions, ADAM17 can cleave MerTK into soluble Mer, impairing efferocytosis. SAA mice exhibit an increase in soluble Mer in the BM. To determine if MerTK cleavage limits efferocytosis, we utilized a mouse model in which MerTK is cleavage resistant (MerTKCR). MerTKCR mice failed to exhibit an increase in efferocytosis or survival. However, SAA mice demonstrated a substantial increase in CD47 (17.6% to 79.8%) on apoptotic BM cells and signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα; 0.5% to 40.0%) on monocytes. CD47-SIRPα is a “don't eat me” axis that prevents the activation of efferocytosis by MerTK. Functionally, SIRPα-CD47 blockade was sufficient to recover efferocytosis. scRNAseq and gene ontology enrichment analysis of human SAA BM monocytes demonstrated a significant upregulation in genes that inhibit efferocytosis, including SIRPA, CD300LF, CD300A, CSK, DYSF, and CNN2. Lipidomic analysis of murine BM revealed a reduction in the precursors of SPMs and increased prostaglandins during SAA, indicative of impaired inflammation resolution. Therapeutic administration of the SPM Resolvin E1 (RvE1) improved efferocytosis, BM cellularity, and SPM production. scRNAseq of whole BM indicated that RvE1 enhanced the regulation of hematopoiesis and limited inflammatory pathways, including T cell activation. Importantly, RvE1 therapy increased survival from 0% to 50%, and survivors exhibited a recovery in HSCs and BM cellularity, as well as reduced T cells by 40 days post-induction. ChemR23, the receptor for RvE1, significantly increases on T cells (8.3% to 30.1%) during SAA. To determine if RvE1 directly acts on T cells, ChemR23-/- mice were induced with wild-type donor splenocytes. RvE1 therapy led to a significant reduction in CD8+ T cells, increased HSCs, and 25% survival.
 Conclusions: We demonstrate that impaired inflammation resolution contributes to SAA progression and that SPMs, such as RvE1, offer a novel treatment for SAA. These studies begin to fill a substantial knowledge gap concerning the mechanisms of inflammation resolution in the BM and the shortcomings of current immunosuppressant therapies that often fail in treating chronic inflammatory disorders.

 Background: Exhausted T cells (Tex) are defined by reduced effector function, yet retain responsiveness to certain immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors. Epcoritamab, a bispecific antibody targeting CD3 on T cells and CD20 on B cells, engages and redirects T cells to kill malignant B cells in relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and R/R follicular lymphoma. This study evaluated the ability of epcoritamab to activate in vitro-derived Tex cells to target and kill CD20-expressing B cells.
 Methods: CD3+ T cells and CD20+ B cells were isolated from healthy donors. T cells underwent 2 cycles of stimulation during a 120-hour incubation in vitro using anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies to mimic chronic T-cell activation and induce T-cell exhaustion. Non-exhausted or in vitro-derived Tex cells were co-cultured with B cells at a 2:1 ratio in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Cell activation, functional status, and cytotoxic activity were assessed using flow cytometry and cytokine profiling panels. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected at baseline from patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) enrolled in the EPCORE NHL-1 study, commercially sourced PBMCs from apparently healthy donors, and commercially sourced PBMCs from patients with multiple solid tumor types were profiled using a T-cell immune-phenotyping panel to characterize peripheral immune fitness.
 Results: Patients from EPCORE NHL-1 with R/R aNHL had increased levels of peripheral T cells expressing markers associated with reduced cell function compared with healthy donors and patients with solid tumors. To investigate whether epcoritamab can activate Tex cells, an in vitro Tex-cell assay was utilized. Following repeated CD3/CD28 co-stimulation, in vitro-derived Tex cells showed increased surface expression of PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, with a concomitant hyporesponsive cytokine response (IFNγ/TNFα/IL-2) and reduced proliferation (Ki67) associated with T-cell dysfunction. Tex cells also exhibited a gene expression profile similar to terminally differentiated Tex cells with elevated levels of HAVCR2 and lower levels of TCF7, a gene highly expressed in precursor Tex cells and downregulated as Tex cells differentiate. Epcoritamab treatment in vitro significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of these Tex cells against CD20-expressing B cells, induced IFN-γ secretion, and promoted Tex-cell activation, demonstrating the capacity of Tex cells to kill in a dose-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, Tex cells showed more rapid B-cell depletion compared with non-exhausted T cells when treated with epcoritamab. Although the Tex cells induced superior B-cell killing at 24 hours, greater Tex-cell death was also observed over 96 hours compared with non-exhausted T cells, suggesting Tex cells may be rapidly depleted after killing target cells.
 Conclusion: Patients from EPCORE NHL-1 with R/R aNHL showed elevated levels of markers associated with exhaustion at baseline. An in vitro Tex-cell assay demonstrated epcoritamab can effectively harness the cytotoxic potential of in vitro-derived Tex cells to target and eliminate CD20-expressing B cells. Ongoing studies are investigating the capacity of Tex cells to kill tumor cells in vitro. Taken together, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of epcoritamab in inducing Tex cell-mediated killing for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Macrophages are essential in maintaining homeostasis, combating infections, and influencing the process of various diseases, including cancer. Macrophages originate from diverse lineages: Notably, tissue‐resident macrophages (TRMs) differ from hematopoietic stem cells and circulating monocyte‐derived macrophages based on genetics, development, and function. Therefore, understanding the recruited and TRM populations is crucial for investigating disease processes. Methods By searching literature databses, we summarized recent relevant studies. Research has shown that tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) of distinct origins accumulate in tumor microenvironment (TME), with TRM‐derived TAMs closely resembling gene signatures of normal TRMs. Results Recent studies have revealed that TRMs play a crucial role in cancer progression. However, organ‐specific effects complicate TRM investigations. Nonetheless, the precise involvement of TRMs in tumors is unclear. This review explores the multifaceted roles of TRMs in cancer, presenting insights into their origins, proliferation, the latest research methodologies, their impact across various tumor sites, their potential and strategies as therapeutic targets, interactions with other cells within the TME, and the internal heterogeneity of TRMs. Conclusions We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of TRMs will pave the way for targeted TRM therapies in the treatment of cancer.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Endometrial cancer (EC), while generally curable in early stages, poses significant challenges when it recurs or advances. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors, have provided a promising therapeutic option for such cases, especially with FDA-approved drugs like pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and dostarlimab. The molecular classification of EC, particularly mismatch repair deficiency, has proven essential in identifying tumors that are likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, owing to their increased tumor mutational burden and higher PD-L1 expression. However, mismatch repair (MMR) status alone is insufficient to predict immune responses as treatment outcomes are also substantially influenced by tumor microenvironment composition, immune infiltration, and inter-individual variability. Emerging cell therapies like Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes offer hope for addressing non-immunogenic tumors, overcoming immune evasion mechanisms that limit natural immune responses.">

Methods Hence, we performed a prospective experimental cohort study to characterise the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in immune-compromised patients (older adults and oncohaematologic patients), compared with healthy counterparts, based on deep characterisation of the circulating immune cell subsets. Results and discussion While acquired humoral and cellular memory did not predict subsequent infection 18 months after full vaccination, spectral and computational cytometry revealed several subsets within the CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and TEMRA Tγδ cells that were differentially expressed in individuals who were subsequently infected and not infected not just following immunisation, but also prior to vaccination. Of note, we found up to seven clusters within the TEMRA Tγδ cell population, with some of them being expanded and others decreased in subsequently infected individuals. Moreover, some of these cellular clusters were also related to COVID-19-induced hospitalisation in oncohaematologic patients. Therefore, we have identified a cellular signature that even before vaccination is related to COVID-19 vulnerability as opposed to the acquisition of cellular and/or humoral memory following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.">

        <tr id="CpG ODN2006 is widely used both in vitro and in vivo to achieve B cell activation and has been previously applied in clinical trials as an adjuvant and anti-cancer agent. Recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of combining CpG ODN2006 with α-IgM antibodies to obtain optimal B cell activation in vitro. In this study, we expanded the knowledge of how both agents affect other types of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thereby highlighting beneficial and potentially unfavorable properties of the combination of CpG ODN2006 and α-IgM when applied beyond isolated B cells. We elucidated the effects of both compounds on mixed PBMCs, as well as on B cell- and monocyte-depleted PBMCs, allowing us to distinguish between direct effects and indirect influences mediated by other interacting immune cells. Flow cytometry was used to measure the expression of surface markers and intracellular cytokines, while ELISA and multiplex assays were performed to determine cytokine secretion. Our results revealed that stimulation of mixed PBMCs with CpG ODN2006 and α-IgM strongly increased cytokine secretion, primarily originating from α-IgM-stimulated monocytes. Monocyte activation was confirmed by increased CD86 and HLA-DR expression and occurred independently of B cells. The high level of monocyte-derived cytokines after α-IgM exposure did not affect B cell activation. However, it represents a rather unfavorable property for clinical applications. In conclusion, α-IgM is a potent inducer of cytokine production in monocytes. Based on our findings we hypothesize that significant side effects on monocytes can occur when using α-IgM to enhance CpG ODN2006’s efficacy on B cells, particularly in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play an integral role in immunosurveillance against myeloid malignancies, with their mature phenotype and abundance linked to prolonged treatment-free remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, NK cell function is suppressed during the disease, and the orchestrators of this impairment are not fully understood. Using a chimeric BCR::ABL1+ CML mouse model, we characterized the impact of the leukemic microenvironment on NK cell function. We showed that NK cells have reduced counts, immature phenotype, poor cytotoxicity, and altered expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in CML mice, which revert to a steady state upon BCR::ABL1 inhibition. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an inflammatory cytokine response in CML-exposed NK cells, highlighted by the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa)-induced gene signature, upregulation of TNFa receptor TNFR2, and enrichment of SOCS family genes such as Cish, the critical NK cell checkpoint. Ex vivo exposure of healthy NK cells to leukemic soluble factors compromised target-specific NK cell degranulation, which was partially rescued by targeting Cish or TNFa. In alignment with these findings, NK cells from healthy donors displayed suppressed cytotoxicity when exposed to plasma from untreated CML patients, with a partial restoration upon Cish or TNFa inhibition. Furthermore, NK cells from newly diagnosed CML patients pre-destined for blast crisis showed an enrichment of the TNFa-induced pro-inflammatory gene signature identified in CML mice. These results suggest that targeting inflammatory signaling could enhance NK cell-based immunotherapies for CML.">

 GBM (glioblastoma) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. While immunotherapy is a promising treatment modality for GBM, most clinical trials have thus far only provided a modest benefit to GBM patients. We propose that enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for GBM requires approaches that increase T cell infiltration and reprogram the myeloid cells to a more pro-inflammatory state. S100A4 is a major regulator of stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and a critical regulator of immune suppressive myeloid and T cell phenotypes in GBM. Targeting S100A4 in either glioma or stromal cells is sufficient to reprogram the tumor immune landscape and extend survival of glioma bearing mice, indicating that S100A4 is a promising immunotherapy target. We recently developed a S100A4 blocking monoclonal antibody; however, this antibody does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) efficiently to confer significant therapeutic benefit, limiting its efficacy in treating GBM. To overcome this challenge, we generated a bispecific S100A4-TfR antibody (BsA) that allows robust BBB penetration, and tested this in a pre-clinical syngeneic, orthotopic mouse model of GBM. Using ELISA, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA sequencing, we report that systemic administration of the S100A4-TfR BsA results in increased immune cell infiltration with a preferential increase in CD4 T cell infiltration, and potent immune remodeling of the tumor microenvironment to a more pro-inflammatory state. Furthermore, the BsA is taken up by glioma cells intracellularly, which is correlated with depletion of intracellular S100A4 and decreased nuclear SOX2 localization, which would reduce stemness of glioma cells. Functionally, in vitro BsA treatment of primary glioma cell cultures shows decreased S100A4 expression, proliferation, and self-renewal. Our results suggest that S100A4-TfR BsA is a novel dual activity inhibitor to simultaneously reprogram the GBM immune landscape and reduce glioma stemness.">

        <tr id="CD74 is a cell-surface receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF binding to CD74 induces a signaling cascade resulting in the release of its cytosolic intracellular domain (CD74-ICD), which regulates transcription in naïve B and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of CD74 in the regulation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and is characterized by massive infiltration of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment, making this tumor a good candidate for immunotherapy. The tumor and immune cells in TNBC express high levels of CD74; however, the function of this receptor in the tumor environment has not been extensively characterized. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) and tolerogenic dendritic cells (tol-DCs) were previously shown to attenuate the antitumor immune response in TNBC. Here, we demonstrate that CD74 enhances tumor growth by inducing the expansion of tumor-infiltrating tol-DCs and Bregs. Utilizing CD74-KO mice, Cre-flox mice lacking CD74 in CD23+ mature B cells, mice lacking CD74 in the CD11c+ population, and a CD74 inhibitor (DRQ), we elucidate the mechanism by which CD74 inhibits antitumor immunity. MIF secreted from the tumor cells activates CD74 expressed on DCs. This activation induces the binding of CD74-ICD to the SP1 promotor, resulting in the up-regulation of SP1 expression. SP1 binds the IL-1β promotor, leading to the down-regulation of its transcription. The reduced levels of IL-1β lead to decreased antitumor activity by allowing expansion of the tol-DC, which induces the expansion of the Breg population, supporting the cross-talk between these 2 populations. Taken together, these results suggest that CD74+ CD11c+ DCs are the dominant cell type involved in the regulation of TNBC progression. These findings indicate that CD74 might serve as a novel therapeutic target in TNBC.">

 Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has demonstrated promise in treating haematological malignancies, but resistance and limited durable responses are common, potentially due to T-cell intrinsic fitness. To better understand these differences in efficacy, we conducted STRT-seq sequencing on pre-infusion CAR-T products from B-ALL and DLBCL patients receiving CAR19/22 T-cell cocktail therapy. Patients were classified as responders and non-responders based on clinical response, and subsequent analysis revealed differences in T-cell transcriptional profiles between the two groups. Notably, non-responders exhibited an enriched type I IFN signaling pathway. A previous study has shown that upregulated type I IFN signaling in baseline CAR-T cell products is associated with CAR-T cell dysfunction and failure in the clinic (Gregory M. Chen, et al. Cancer Discovery, 2021). Therefore, we hypothesized that type I IFN may be a key regulator of CAR-T cell dysfunction.
 To evaluate the impact of type I IFN on CAR-T cells, we conducted in vitro experiments to assess the phenotypic and functional changes in CD19 CAR-T cells after exposure to recombinant human IFN-β. Following 48 hours of IFN-β treatment, CAR-T cells co-cultured with Nalm6 cells showed significantly reduced cytotoxicity while secreting increased effector cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-γ, Granzyme B and TNF-α compared to controls. However, pretreated CAR-T cell showed no deficiencies in proliferation or degranulation. Subsequently, we examined the activity of pretreated or control CD19 CAR-T cells in a xenograft mouse model with NALM6-Luc cells. In vivo, IFN-β pretreated CAR-T cell displayed significantly weaker anti-tumour effects than the control group, resulting in a survival disadvantage for the mice. These findings suggested a potential role for type I IFN in potentiating CAR T cell dysfunction. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved, bulk RNA-seq analyses were performed on unstimulated and antigen-stimulated CAR-T cells with or without IFN-β exposure. The analysis revealed increased expression of genes associated with response to type I interferon and negative regulation of T cell mediated immunity in both cell states, indicating ongoing type I IFN signaling. Particularly in antigen-stimulated CAR-T cells, IFN-β treatment suppressed multiple pathways related to cell-cell adhesion, regulation of Rho protein signaling, and modification of postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton. Confocal imaging further revealed that IFN-β treatment impaired the binding of CAR-T cells to tumor cells, inhibited immune synapse (IS) assembly and function, as shown by significantly impaired F-actin polymerization, and defective polarization of centrosomes and lytic granule to the IS. Mechanistically, type I IFN targets T-cell Rho-GTPase activation signaling-key regulators of actin dynamics at the T-cell synapse. IFN-β treatment resulted in a decrease in the level of activated RhoA and Rac1 in CAR-T cell stimulated with CD19 protein. Conversely, these deficiencies were reversed by CAR-T cells in which IFNAR1 had been knocked out.
 Furthermore, we investigated the potential of utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to delete IFNAR1 in order to enhance CAR-T cell potency. Our results indicate that human IFNAR1-edited CAR-T cells exhibited significantly resistant to immunosuppressive effects of type I IFN in vitro and in vivo, without any detrimental impact on the phenotype or function of CAR-T cells. Additionally, preclinical animal models showed that IFNAR1-edited CAR-T cells were well tolerated and safe.
 In conclusion, our study reveals a novel role of type I IFN in modulating CAR-T cell dysfunction by disrupting the stabilization of IS formation. We propose the use of IFNAR1-edited CAR-T cells as a potential approach to enhance CAR-T cell function.

 Clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have benefited many cancer patients but failed in a number of tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. The main obstacle for ICI efficacy in GBM is the continuously evolving tumor microenvironment (TME), in which antitumor immunity is inhibited or eluded by tumor-secreted factors. Accumulation and reprogramming of myeloid cells (GAMs) creates a “cold” immunosuppressive TME with a poor infiltration and exhaustion of effector T cells. We employ Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) with 40 protein markers along with spatial transcriptomics and immunophenotyping to dissect identities and functionalities of immune cells (CD45+) in experimental GL261 gliomas. The results revealed identities of immune cells instrumental for creating the immunosuppressive milieu and cell-cell communication networks. We have developed a designer RGD peptide that blocks the reprogramming of GAMs by targeting tumor-GAMs interactions. We demonstrate that RGD efficiently blocks microglia-dependent invasion of murine and human glioma cells in vitro. We explored if the intratumorally delivered RGD can revert tumor-induced changes in the TME of experimental gliomas and improve anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. While RGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in vivo, it prevented reprogramming of myeloid cells into protumoral GAMs and led to the normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining RGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, increase in percentages of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of GAMs were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME which resulted in boosting immunotherapy responses. Intratumorally delivered RGD modified in the same way functionalities of GAMs in the TME of human U87MG gliomas in nude mice. Our results demonstrate that the integrin blockade combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors reinvigorates both innate and adaptive antitumor immunity. The results pave the way to improve responses to immunotherapy in GBM and other cancers.">

        <tr id="The increasing use of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade has led to the emergence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including dysfunction of the submandibular gland (SMG). In this study, we investigated the immunoregulatory mechanism contributing to the susceptibility of the SMG to irAEs. We found that the SMGs of PD-1-deficient mice and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-treated mice harbor an expanded population of CD8+ T cells. We demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells expressing PD-L1 tightly regulate CD8+ T cells in the SMG. When this immunoregulation is disrupted, CD8+ T cells clonally expand and acquire a unique transcriptional profile consistent with T cell receptor (TCR) activation. These clonally expanded cells phenotypically overlapped with cytotoxic GzmK+ CD8+ T autoimmune cells identified in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Understanding how NK cells modulate CD8+ T cell activity in the SMG opens new avenues for preventing irAEs in patients undergoing checkpoint blockade therapies.">

 Adoptive cell therapies have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for B-cell neoplasms, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lower response rates are observed for anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies. This therapeutic failure is mainly attributed to the profound T-cell exhaustion seen in CLL and the highly suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we present a novel approach to improve CAR-T therapy by targeting the alarmin S100-A9. This protein plays a pivotal role in the TME of solid tumors and other hematologic malignancies by promoting the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We recently demonstrated that S100-A9 contributes to activating inflammatory pathways in B-CLL cells. We hypothesize that S100-A9 inhibitors could indirectly potentiate T cell fitness by decreasing chronic inflammation and modulating the CLL TME, ultimately leading to lower T cell exhaustion and suppression.



 Flow cytometry assessed S100-A9 expression in B-CLL cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of 20 CLL patients. Nurse-like cells (NLCs) were obtained using PBMCs from individuals with CLL. MDSCs were differentiated from the BM of Eµ-TCL1 mice and treated in vitro with an S100-A9 inhibitor. To evaluate the in vivo immunomodulatory effect of targeting S100-A9, C57BL/6 were injected with splenocytes from Eµ-TCL1 mice and treated with the oral S100-A9 inhibitor, tasquinimod (TasQ). T cells were isolated from the spleen of TasQ-treated and control mice, activated with CD28/CD3 beads, transduced with the CAR construct, and then injected into Eµ-TCL1 mice with established disease. All immunophenotyping analyses were performed using a BD FACSymphony cytometer.



 Significantly higher S100-A9 expression was found in B-CLL cells from the patient's BM compared with PB. Additionally, NLCs and myeloid and T cell co-stimulatory signals enhanced S100-A9 expression in leukemic lymphocytes. S100-A9 was expressed in neoplastic B-CLL cells and in MDSCs from CLL patients. Similar to previously shown in multiple myeloma and several solid tumors, in vitro treatment with the S100-A9 inhibitor, TasQ decreases PD-L1 and Arginase 1 expression in MDSCs derived from the BM of CLL-bearing mice. To evaluate the in vivo effect of TasQ, adoptive transfer Eµ-TCL1 mice were treated with this oral inhibitor or vehicle for four weeks. TasQ-treated mice showed more prolonged survival, less accumulation of MDSCs, and fewer patrolling monocytes in the spleen. Additionally, T cells were skewed toward a predominant naive and central memory phenotype in the TasQ group. Given the immunomodulatory benefits of S100-A9 inhibitors, we evaluated whether T-cells from TasQ-treated mice can be an excellent source to build more efficacious CAR-T cells. Notably, CAR-T cells manufactured from TasQ-treated T cells expanded faster in vitro and maintained their central memory phenotype after one week of expansion. Likewise, TasQ-treated CAR-T cells lasted longer in the PB of adoptive transfer Eµ-TCL1 mice. They could control CLL progression more effectively than CART manufacture from vehicle-treated mice.



 Our study demonstrates that targeting S100-A9 decreases the suppressive TME in CLL. This finding makes S100-A9 inhibitors promising candidates for bridge therapy to improve T-cell fitness and enhance the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary CD59 prevents the formation of membrane attack complex, enabling tumor cells to escape complement-mediated cytotoxicity. It appears that the expression of CD59 significantly impacts survival outcomes due to its interaction with immune cells. The associations between CD59 and immune suppressive cells such as T-regulatory cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, and macrophage create an immune suppressive environment in cervical, brain, head and neck, and stomach cancers. However, kidney cancer has less or no association, leading to better survival outcomes. Thus, assessing the levels of CD59 and its immune cell associations is crucial as it plays a predictive role in deciding prognostic outcomes. Abstract Background: CD59, a GPI-anchored membrane protein, protects cancer cells from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by inhibiting the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). It has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in most solid tumors, where it facilitates tumor cell escape from complement surveillance. The role of CD59 in cancer growth and interactions between CD59 and immune cells that modulate immune evasion has not been well explored. Methods: Using cancer patient database from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other public databases, we analyzed CD59 expression, its prognostic significance, and its association with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, identifying associated genomic and functional networks and validating findings with invitro cell-line experimental data. Results: This article describes the abundant expression of CD59 in multiple tumors such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), as well as in pan-cancer, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and confirmed using multiple cancer cell lines. The expression of CD59 significantly alters the overall survival (OS) of patients with multiple malignancies such as CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD. Further, the correlation between CD59 and Treg and/or MDSC in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has shown to be strongly associated with poor outcomes in CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD as these tumors express high FOXP3 compared to KIRC. Moreover, unfavorable outcomes were strongly associated with the expression of CD59 and M2 tumor-associated macrophage infiltration in the TME via the IL10/pSTAT3 pathway in CESC and GBM but not in KIRC. In addition, TGFβ1-dominant cancers such as CESC, GBM, and HNSC showed a high correlation between CD59 and TGFβ1, leading to suppression of cytotoxic T cell activity. Conclusion: Overall, the correlation between CD59 and immune cells predicts its prognosis as unfavorable in CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD while being favorable in KIRC.">

To investigate the pro-phagocytic phenotype of macrophages in SSc and other rheumatic diseases by examining their activation, signaling pathways, and treatment responses, with the goal of uncovering mechanisms that drive enhanced phagocytosis.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (GSE138669/GSE212109) from skin and lung macrophages of healthy controls and SSc patients were analyzed. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) were differentiated from CD14+ monocytes from healthy controls, SSc, RA, PsA, and axSpA patients. In selected experiments, hMDMs were pretreated with 0.1 μM nintedanib. Phagocytic activity was quantified using pHrodo bioparticles and flow cytometry. Macrophage surface markers were evaluated by flow cytometry, NF-κB signaling by Western blot, and gene expression by RT-qPCR.


RESULTS
Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets revealed a pro-phagocytic signature in SSc-affected organs. SSc macrophages, particularly the FCGR3A  hi cluster in skin, exhibited elevated expression of FCGR genes and enriched FcγR-mediated phagocytosis pathways, accompanied by pro-inflammatory markers. This phenotype extended to FCN1  hi lung macrophages in SSc patients with interstitial lung disease, indicating a systemic pro-inflammatory and phagocytic profile. hMDMs from SSc, RA, and PsA patients demonstrated enhanced phagocytic activity in vitro. Elevated FcγRI and FcγRII levels were identified as key drivers of increased phagocytic activity and subsequent IL-6-driven inflammation. Nintedanib showed reduction in FcγRI expression, suggesting its potential therapeutic benefit in attenuating the phagocytic process.


CONCLUSION
This study highlights FcγR-expressing macrophages as drivers of phagocytosis and inflammatory responses in SSc. Dysregulated activation of these macrophages could lead to persistent inflammation and fibrosis in rheumatic diseases, highlighting new potential therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is characterized by a concomitant early pro-inflammatory response by immune cells to an infection, and an opposing anti-inflammatory response that results in protracted immunosuppression. The primary pathological event in sepsis is widespread programmed cell death, or cellular self-sacrifice, of innate and adaptive immune cells, leading to profound immunological suppression. This severe immune dysfunction hampers effective primary pathogen clearance, thereby increasing the risk of secondary opportunistic infections, latent viral reactivation, multiple organ dysfunction, and elevated mortality. The types of cell death include apoptosis (type I programmed cell death), autophagy (type II programmed cell death), NETosis (a program for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)) and other programmed cell deaths like pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, each contributing to immunosuppression in distinct ways during the later phases of sepsis. Extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, such as CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, is strongly associated with immunosuppression. Apoptosis of dendritic cells further compromises T and B cell survival and can induce T cell anergy or promote regulatory Treg cell proliferation. Moreover, delayed apoptosis and impaired neutrophil function contribute to nosocomial infections and immune dysfunction in sepsis. Interestingly, aberrant NETosis and the subsequent depletion of mature neutrophils also trigger immunosuppression, and neutrophil pyroptosis can positively regulate NETosis. The interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) plays a key role in T cell modulation and neutrophil apoptosis in sepsis. The dendritic cell growth factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLTEL), increases DC numbers, enhances CD 28 expression, attenuates PD-L1, and improves survival in sepsis. Recently, immunoadjuvant therapies have attracted attention for their potential to restore host physiological immunity and homeostasis in patients with sepsis. This review focuses on several potential immunotherapeutic agents designed to bolster suppressed innate and adaptive immune responses in the management of sepsis.">

 Key words: Trained immunity, Pax5-/+ mice, B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), bone marrow microenvironment (BME), chronic infection
 Background: Pax5 heterozygosity (Pax5-/+), resulting in reduced PAX5 levels in mice, mimics germline or somatic PAX5 dysregulation, contributing to diseases including B-ALL. In contrast to the well-characterized roles of PAX5 during early B cell development, little is known about how Pax5 heterozygosity impacts anti-viral responses. Viral infections pose a significant global burden. Host susceptibility to chronic pathogens is determined by many factors including genetic variation leading to immunodeficient or dysregulated anti-viral immune responses.
 Aims: We aimed to characterize the effects of a chronic viral infection in the BME of the Pax5-/+ mouse model using a chronic strain of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). LCMV is a non-cytopathic virus that has been extensively utilized to investigate virus-induced immunopathology, effector responses and immune tolerance.
 Methods: Pax5-/+ mice backcrossed to the C57BL/6J background were infected with LCMV-Docile (1*106 PFU). Using flow cytometry, multiplex ELISA, plaque and antibody neutralizing assays, innate and late adaptive immune responses in infected Pax5-/+ and WT (Pax5+/+) were assessed followed by β-glucan pre-administration as a prophylactic prevention.
 Results: We found that infection with the LCMV chronic Docile strain resulted in decreased survival of Pax5-/+ mice (n of 12-21, P<0.05). Early (day 15) viral titers were not different between Pax5-/+ and WT mice in multiple organs and early adaptive CD8+ T cell (CTL) immunity was also robust in Pax5-/+ mice. However, LCMV-specific neutralizing antibody production was severely compromised in Pax5-/+ mice following chronic infection leading to impaired long-term viral clearance and a pro-inflammatory milieu in the BM or serum with CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL4 and CCL3 being elevated at day 120 post infection in Pax5-/+ mice. In addition, increased CTL exhaustion as well as reduced plasma cells were observed in the BM of Pax5-/+ mice (n of 3-5, P<0.05). Importantly, survival outcomes were improved upon prophylactic treatment with the β-glucan immune trainer through induction of heterologous protection against chronic infection (n of 6-10, P<0.05). β-glucan enhanced viral clearance, CTL immunity and reduced PD-L1 expression on monocytes in multiple LCMV-resident host organs.
 Conclusion: Our study showed that Pax5-/+ mice succumbed to LCMV chronic Docile strain due to impaired LCMV-specific neutralizing antibody production and long-term viral clearance, as well as increased inflammation. Prophylactic treatment with β-glucan improved survival by enhancing viral clearance, CTL immunity, and reducing monocyte immunosuppression. New insight from this study will help design effective prophylactic strategies against chronic viral infections particularly in genetically-predisposed susceptible hosts.

 Introduction
 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly aggressive malignancy of myeloid progenitors associated with a poor prognosis. AML is characterized by a block in differentiation and the acquisition of self-renewal capacity. The hematopoietic system balances self-renewal and differentiation in response to various environmental cues. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that belong to a subfamily of fatty acid-activated nuclear steroid hormone receptors, which coordinate cellular gene expression programs with environmental cues effecting regulation of multiple cellular processes including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and inflammation. We found that PPARA expression levels and signaling signature were upregulated in intermediate and high cytogenetic risk subgroups of AML leading us to hypothesize that PPARA regulates AML maintenance.
 Methods
 We generated murine Ppara-homozygous and heterozygous-deficient GFP+ MLL-AF9 leukemia through retroviral infection and transplantation into primary wildtype or Rag2-/- recipients. FACS-sorted GFP+ cells of each genotype were isolated for downstream flow cytometric analysis of subpopulations, cytospins and ex-vivo assays. Transcriptomic data was obtained by RNAseq.
 Results
 Ppara deletion improves monocytic leukemia survival : Secondary recipients of Ppara -/- and +/- leukemia displayed decreased GFP+ bone marrow-mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) and peripheral blood-MNC and spleen infiltration which resulted in a statistically significant survival advantage compared to wildtype leukemia controls [p=0.002]. This was not due to increased apoptosis evaluated by Annexin-V staining or proliferation rate of GFP+ knockout as compared to wildtype leukemia ex-vivo.
 Ppara deletion promotes monocytic leukemia granulocytic differentiation : Review of GFP+ BM-MNC revealed differentiation in Ppara-/- leukemia characterized by a decrease in cells with monocytic immunophenotype by flow cytometry employing monocyte and granulocyte markers Ly6C and Ly6G respectively. Notably, a population of cells with a granulocytic immunophenotype was detected in Ppara-/- leukemia but absent in Ppara+/+ leukemia. Cytospins of the Ppara-/- GFP+ FACS-sorted granulocytic population provided morphologic evidence of terminally differentiated neutrophils. Furthermore, bulk RNAseq of FACS-sorted GFP+ granulocytic cells from 4 Ppara-/- leukemia mice and unbiased cell type recognition using SingleR (Bioconductor) was performed. Using two mouse reference datasets, SingleR annotated all 4 samples as neutrophils. By contrast, FACS-sorted Ppara+/+ and Ppara-/- GFP+ monocytic populations were annotated as stem cells, similar to KSL and GMP cells from non-leukemic WT mice.
 Ppara deletion regulates adaptive immune response : To understand how PPARA regulates leukemia progression, we undertook global transcriptomics analysis. Most perturbations in Ppara-/- versus Ppara+/+ leukemia involved downregulation of pathways, consistent with PPARA's known role as a transcriptional activator, with multiple pathways noted to converge on metabolism, macromolecule trafficking and processing. Additionally, multiple biological process terms differentially enriched between Ppara+/+ and Ppara-/- leukemia also reflected alterations in immune response. To evaluate this further, we transplanted Ppara-/- leukemia into Rag2-/- recipients, which resulted in a partial collapse of the survival benefit compared to wildtype leukemia. We queried the human relevance of these findings and found positive regulation of adaptive immune response and antigen processing and presentation in upregulated pathways of PPARA_low AML vs. PPARA_high AML cases from the BEAT AML database.
 Conclusion
 A monocytic AML model with genetic Ppara deletion demonstrates granulocytic differentiation resulting in leukemia-derived terminally differentiated neutrophils, associated with positive regulation of adaptive immune response and with prolonged survival. Future studies on the interaction of PPARA, leukemia cell composition and anti-tumor immunity are warranted.

        <tr id="Abstract Rationale Elevated levels of CD11c+ myeloid cells are observed in various pulmonary disorders, including Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MΦ) are critical antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) that direct adaptive immunity. However, the role of CD11c+ myeloid cells in lung extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and pulmonary fibrosis is poorly understood. Objective We aimed to investigate the impact of depleting CD11c+ myeloid cells, including DCs and macrophages, during bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Methods We used a diphtheria toxin (DTx) receptor (DTR) transgenic mouse model (CD11c‐DTR‐Tg) to deplete CD11c+ myeloid cells through two methods: Systemic Depletion (SD) via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) and local depletion (LD) via intranasal instillation (i.n.). We then assessed the effects of CD11c+ cell depletion during bleomycin‐induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. Results Fourteen days after bleomycin instillation, there was a progressive accumulation of myeloid cells, specifically F4/80‐MHCII+CD11c+ DCs and F4/80 + MHCII+CD11c+ MΦ, preceding mortality and pulmonary fibrosis. Systemic depletion of CD11c+ DCs and MΦ via i.p. DTx administration in CD11c‐DTR‐Tg mice protected against bleomycin‐induced mortality and pulmonary fibrosis compared to wild‐type (WT) mice. Systemic depletion reduced myeloid cells, airway inflammation (total leukocytes, neutrophils, and CD4+ lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators, and fibrosis‐related mRNAs (Collagen‐1α1 and α‐SMA). Increased anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 and CXCL9 levels were observed, resulting in lower lung hydroxyproline content and Ashcroft fibrosis score. Conversely, local depletion of CD11c+ cells increased mortality by acute leukocyte influx (predominantly neutrophils, DCs, and MΦ in BAL) correlated to IL‐1β, with lung hyper‐inflammation and early fibrosis development. Conclusion Systemic depletion of CD11c+ cells confers protection against inflammation and fibrosis induced by Bleomycin, underscoring the significance of myeloid cells expressing F4/80‐MHCII+CD11c+ DCs and F4/80 + MHCII+CD11c+ MΦ orchestrating the inflammatory milieu within the lungs, potentially as a source of cytokines sustaining pulmonary chronic inflammation leading to progressive fibrosis and mortality.">

 Effector B cell responses in solid malignancies are associated with favorable response to immunotherapy. B cells can amplify anti-tumor immune responses via antibody production, antigen presentation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release; yet B cells in cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice often fail to support these functions. We have evaluated the contribution of either systemic inflammatory cues or antigenic quality to B cell differentiation and function in cancer. First, we identify dysregulated transcriptional programs activated in pancreatic cancer-associated B cells that promote differentiation of naïve into immunosuppressive B cells and inhibit differentiation of anti-tumor plasma cells. Second, we find that systemic exposure to STING agonists potentiates expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory human and mouse IL35+ B lymphocytes. Finally, using a system where a B cell neoantigen is either soluble or tethered to the surface of cancer cells, we demonstrate that membrane-tethered antigen is sufficient to elicit activation of anti-tumor immunity and reduce tumor growth in a NK cell-dependent manner. Thus, inflammation and quality of antigen impact basic mechanisms governing B cell differentiation and the resulting immune response to solid malignancy with implications for vaccine engineering.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients.We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex.Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection.These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell (PC) malignancy. Despite therapeutic advances that have vastly improved survival, all patients are expected to relapse. Current standard of care includes autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) with high-dose melphalan (HDM) administered as a conditioning agent. Cytotoxic chemotherapies such as melphalan have been shown to drive therapy-induced senescence (TIS) in several tissues. We hypothesize that HDM activates TIS pathways in surviving MM cells and that this may correlate with patient outcomes post-ASCT.
 We developed an in vitro HDM model using 5TGM1 mouse MM cells treated with vehicle (Veh) or HDM (10µM, IC90) for 6h, followed by co-culture with primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells. Image analysis was performed to quantify proliferation by cumulative population doublings (CPDs) over 10 days, after which 5TGM1 cells were evaluated for cell size, telomere-associated DNA damage foci (TAFs), sensitivity to senolysis, and senescence gene expression (scRNA-seq and RT-qPCR). The effect of HDM on CPDs and cell size was also evaluated in human MM cell lines RPMI-8226 and H929. scRNA-seq was used to analyze CD138+ PCs from MM patients at various timepoints post-ASCT. Longitudinal MM patient iliac crest biopsies (diagnosis, post-ASCT; N=20) were stained for CD138+ PCs; PC burden was quantified by AI-assisted histology. Lastly, we established an in vivo model of induction therapy (bortezomib) followed by HDM/SCT in Vk*MYC mouse MM engrafted C57BL/6 mice. Tumor burden was tracked by serum protein electrophoresis for M-spike using submandibular bleeds. Bone marrow was then flushed from long bones and analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.
 HDM-5TGM1 showed decreased CPDs (HDM 0.32±0.31, Veh 6.72±0.69, p<0.0001, N=3), increased size (median pixel size: HDM 413.2±99.98, Veh 207±8.88, p<0.05, N=3), and increased TAF+ cells (Percent TAF+ cells: HDM 34.77%±10.74%, Veh 11.41%±1.58%, p<0.05, N=3) consistent with known TIS features. Preliminary assessment (N=1) of human MM cell lines showed similar growth arrest (RPMI-8226 CPDs: HDM 0.058±0.101, Veh 4.185±0.358; H929 CPDs: HDM 0±0, Veh 4.61±0.243) and size increase (RPMI-8226 mean pixel size: HDM 804.1±6.048, Veh 526.9±2.115; H929 mean pixel size: HDM 371.2±26.95, Veh 130.3±41.43), suggesting a translatable mechanism. HDM-5TGM1 cells were more sensitive to senolysis by dasatinib+quercetin (viability: HDM 54.9%±0.09%, Veh 76.0%±0.05%, N=2). scRNA-seq analysis showed that HDM-5TGM1 were enriched for gene sets related to senescence pathways, including the published set SenMayo (FDR<0.25). HDM-5TGM1 cells also exhibited myeloid gene expression consistent with previous publications on MM dormancy. RT-qPCR confirmed significant increases in HDM-5TGM1 (p<0.001, N=3) in senescence markers (Cdkn1a, Cdkn1c, Glb1), senescent cell anti-apoptosis pathway genes (SCAPs, Bcl2l1), senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes (Ccl5, Icam1, Mmp13), and myeloid markers (Axl, Fcer1g, Mpeg1). scRNA-seq of patient CD138+ PCs confirmed a myeloid-like cluster that gained prominence in relapsed patients with resistant disease.
 CD138+ PCs were detected in patient bone biopsies post-ASCT. Interestingly, patients who relapsed (≤3 years, N=9) had a greater percent reduction in PC burden from diagnosis to post-ASCT when compared to patients that did not relapse (N=11) in that time (p=0.02). Further, CD138+ PC burden post-ASCT positively correlated with time in remission in relapsed patients (R=0.697, p=0.03).
 Bortezomib reduced serum M-spike in Vk*MYC-engrafted mice (p=0.0003); M-spike was further reduced by HDM/SCT compared to Veh-treated mice (p=0.0007). Flow cytometry confirmed a decrease in Vk*MYC cells after HDM/SCT (p=0.0043), and the percentage of Vk*MYC cells with greater size and complexity was increased compared to Veh-treated mice (p=0.0043), consistent with our in vitro data. Vk*MYC cells from HDM-treated mice also trended for more TAF+ cells (>3 TAFs) compared to Veh-treated mice (p=0.0714).
 Our findings suggest that HDM can induce a TIS and myeloid signature in surviving MM cells. Greater MM burden post-ASCT appears to be associated with longer durable response, again suggesting that these cells may be in growth arrest consistent with TIS. Finally, senolytics may be a novel approach to eliminate surviving MM cells and prevent relapse.

 Introduction: The balance between activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells regulates their ability to recognize and eliminate target cells. This balance's impact on myeloma (MM) progression and immune surveillance remains unclear. The 2B4 (CD244) receptor modulates NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine production, containing four Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Switch Motifs (ITSMs) that interact with various adaptor molecules to relay both inhibitory and activating signals. CD244's ligand, CD48, is a surface glycoprotein overexpressed in MM cells (Ferguson et al., Nat Comm 2022). While high CD48 expression in solid tumors often links to poor prognosis, its role in hematological malignancies is less clear. CD48 is believed to activate NK cells, and its absence may impair NK cell function, though this is not well elucidated.
 Methods: We assessed the role of CD48 in MM using RNA-seq data from the coMMpass (IA19) study, analyzed with DESeq2, survminer, and survival packages in R. Public scRNA-seq data (GSE223060) was also analyzed with Seurat v4.3.0, comparing 53 MM patients (MMPt) to 7 healthy donor (HD) bone marrow samples. Harmony package was used for data integration. To identify transcription factors (TFs) binding to the CD48 locus, MMPt ATAC-seq and ENCODE ChIP-seq data were analyzed, informing an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. NK cells' role in MM progression was examined using an in vivo mouse model with the Vk*MYC cell line, where NK cell depletion was achieved with anti-NK1.1 antibody, and MM progression was monitored via bioluminescence.
 Results: RNA-seq analysis of the CoMMpass dataset showed elevated CD48 expression in high-risk MM subtypes, such as t(4;14) and gain 1q21 (p-value < 0.0001). Higher CD48 expression correlated with poorer overall survival (top 20% vs. bottom 20% expression, p-value = 0.0044). This suggests that increased CD48 expression might impair NK cell immunosurveillance of MM, contrary to cell line-based CRISPR screens indicating CD48 can activate NK cells (Dufva et al., Immunity (2023); Liu et al., Nat Commun (2024)). Analysis of scRNA-seq data from 150,256 cells revealed a trend toward higher CD244 expression in MMPt NK cells compared to HD, with elevated levels of inhibitory phosphatases binding to ITSMs and triggering inhibitory NK cell signaling through CD244, such as SHIP1 (INPP5D), SHP1 (PTPN6), and EAT-2 (SH2D1B). SAP (SH2D1A), an activating phosphatase, was also higher in MMPt NK cells. Distinct NK cell subclusters were observed in MM patients, showing a phenotype similar to the adaptive NK CD56-dim phenotype with high expression of cytotoxic markers (GNLY, PRF1, NKG7, FGFBP2) and altered receptor expression, including downregulation of KLRB1 and KLRF1, and upregulation of inhibitory receptors KLRC2 and KLRC3. Notably, KLRC2 was predominantly upregulated in NK cell subclusters from MM patients absent in healthy donors. To explore potential drivers of CD48 expression in MM, ATAC-seq and ENCODE ChIP-seq data identified 89 TFs potentially binding the CD48 locus in primary MM samples. An XGBoost model indicated TFs associated with MM progression, such as IRF4, predicted CD48 expression (R^2 = 0.40). Using the syngeneic Vk*MYC mouse model, in vitro co-culture of CD48 knockout or CD48 overexpression Vk*MYC cells suggested that increased CD48 modestly enhanced KIL.C2 murine NK cell killing of tumor cells. In the immunocompetent Vk*MYC mouse model, NK cell depletion led to accelerated and more aggressive MM progression, highlighting the critical role of NK cells in tumor control.
 Conclusions: NK cells play a crucial role in controlling MM progression. Although previous studies have focused on CD48's role in NK cell activation using cells from HD, our findings suggest that CD48's effects on NK cells are complex and might be a significant prognostic factor in the MM microenvironment. Further research is needed to investigate NK cell surface markers related to dysfunction, such as CD244 and KLRC2, and to understand how increased CD48 influences MM evasion of NK cell-mediated surveillance, particularly in relation to adaptive NK cells and inhibitory phosphatases like SHIP1 and EAT-2.

        <tr id="Cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), is a crucial receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in various solid tumors, including lung, breast, and liver cancers. The concomitant expression of c-MET and PD-L1 in tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, highlights their prognostic significance and connection to therapeutic resistance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), activating c-MET signaling in tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). This activation leads to metabolic reprogramming and increased activity of enzymes like glutaminase (GLS), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and arginase 1 (ARG1), depleting essential amino acids in the tumor microenvironment that are vital for effector immune cell function. This review highlights the interplay between tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that create an immunosuppressive environment while providing targets for c-MET-focused immunotherapy. It emphasizes the clinical implications of c-MET inhibition on the behavior of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and NK cells. It explores the potential of c-MET antagonism combined with immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance cancer treatment paradigms. This review also discusses the innovative cancer immunotherapies targeting c-MET, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates, while encouraging the development of a comprehensive strategy that simultaneously tackles immune evasion and enhances anti-tumor efficacy further to improve the clinical prognoses for patients with c-MET-positive malignancies. Despite the challenges and variability in efficacy across different cancer subtypes, continued research into the molecular mechanisms and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies will be crucial.">

 Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) tumor growth can shape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in the bone marrow (BM), affecting tumor growth, bone disease, drug resistance, and promote disease progression. Understanding the interactions between MM cells and the immune microenvironment is crucial for overcoming MM's immunosuppressed state. This study examines the functions and induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) in the MM microenvironment and their impact on MM progression.
 Materials and Methods: (1) Flow cytometry (FCM) was assessed two conventional DC (cDC; lineage-/HLA-DR+/CD11c+) subsets, cDC1 (CD141+ cDC) and cDC2 (CD1c+ cDC), in BM samples obtained from patients with MM (n=17) and healthy controls (n=13). (2) Monocytes were cultured with GM-CSF to generate monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which were then co-cultured with MM cell lines using a Transwell system. moDC characteristics and functions were analyzed using real-time PCR, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), western blotting, ELISA, and FCM after lipopolysaccharide stimulation.
 Results: The frequency of cDC1 subsets was significantly lower in MM patients compared to controls, whereas the frequency of major cDC2 subsets remained unchanged. Similarly, moDCs cocultured with MM cells, were markedly reduced in numbers. These moDCs exhibited decreased expression of activation markers CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83, and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-12, but increased expression of immunosuppressive factors IL-10, ARG1, and NOS2, driven by elevated transcription factor C/EBPβ. RNA-seq analysis revealed several gene expressions in signaling pathways associated with activated DCs were significantly downregulated in moDCs co-cultured with MM cells. Moreover, these moDCs inhibited T-cell proliferation, activation, and interferon-γ production compared to control moDCs, indicating immature and tolerogenic phenotypes. These phenotypes were induced via mTOR/S6K inactivation and increased autophagy mediated by acidic pH and low-glutamine conditions in MM cells. Notably, in RNA-seq analysis, gene expression related to “NOD-like receptor signaling” was significantly upregulated in moDCs co-cultured with MM cells. This triggered inflammasome activation, subsequently activating caspase-1 and increasing mature IL-1β and IL-18 levels in the cell culture supernatants. Consequently, caspase-1-dependent pyroptotic cell death was induced in moDCs. Acidic pH and low-glutamine conditions upregulated inflammasome-related genes but did not trigger IL-1β secretion via inflammasome activation in moDCs. Additionally, MM-derived monoclonal immunoglobulins G and A (IgG and IgA, respectively; also known as M-proteins) triggered IL-1β secretion in moDCs, unlike serum-derived polyclonal IgG. M protein-treated moDCs also exhibited reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, and inhibited T-cell proliferation and activation.
 Conclusions: Patients with MM exhibit a reduced frequency of cDC1 subsets, which are essential for cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells, indicating suppressed adaptive immune responses in the BM microenvironment. moDCs may promote immature and tolerogenic phenotypes and impaired function due to decreased DC activation signals under M-protein stimulation as well as acidic pH and low-glutamine conditions in MM microenvironments. Interestingly, the M-proteins may trigger IL-1β secretion through inflammasome activation in moDCs, fostering pro-tumorigenic inflammation that promotes MM cell growth and survivals, bone diseases, angiogenesis, and inflammatory stroma cell induction. These findings suggest that MM-specific M-proteins in the tumor microenvironment not only contribute to tolerogenic DC generation but drive disease progression via IL-1β-induced pro-tumorigenic inflammation.

        <tr id="Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune condition which causes significant morbidity in children and young adults and is more severe in its presentation than adult-onset SLE. While many aspects of immune dysfunction have been studied extensively in adult-onset SLE, there is limited and contradictory evidence of how cytotoxic CD8+ T cells contribute to disease pathogenesis and studies exploring cytotoxicity in JSLE are virtually non-existent. Here, we report that CD8+ T cell cytotoxic capacity is reduced in JSLE versus healthy controls, irrespective of treatment or disease activity. Transcriptomic and serum metabolomic analysis identified that this reduction in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in JSLE was associated with upregulated type I interferon (IFN) signalling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances when compared to controls. Greater interrogation of the influence of these pathways on altered cytotoxic CD8+ T cell function demonstrated that JSLE CD8+ T cells had enlarged mitochondria and enhanced sensitivity to IFN-α leading to selective apoptosis of effector memory (EM) CD8+ T cells, which are enriched for cytotoxic mediator-expressing cells. This process ultimately contributes to the observed reduction in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity in JSLE, reinforcing the growing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathogenic factor affecting multiple immune cell populations in type I IFN-driven rheumatic diseases.">

Here, we sought to define a comprehensive repertoire of cell surface antigens that can be targeted to stimulate macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphoma. We developed a high-throughput assay to screen hundreds of antibodies for their ability to provoke macrophages to attack B-cell lymphoma cells. Across both mouse and human systems, we identified multiple unappreciated targets of opsonization as well as putative immune checkpoints. We used this information to engineer a compendium of 156 bispecific antibodies, and we identified dozens of bispecifics that dramatically stimulate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity of lymphoma cells. Among these, a bispecific comprising a SIRPα decoy domain and a CD38-targeting arm (WTa2d1xCD38) exhibited maximal efficacy while minimizing the risk of hematologic toxicity. This bispecific stimulated robust anti-tumor responses in multiple xenograft models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Our approach can be directly applied to other cancers to rapidly discover bispecific antibodies that leverage anti-tumor responses by macrophages or other innate immune cells.">

 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells have proven highly successful in the treatment of some haemopoietic neoplasms. However, in many cases the treatment fails and/or disease relapses. Amongst the different factors that impact on a negative clinical outcome, an unfavourable immunosuppressive microenvironment has been proposed as playing a critical role. One of the key molecules in the microenvironment that have been identified as impairing anti-tumor immunity is prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2). We hypothesised that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) acquire the ability to secrete PGE2 after exposure to CAR-T cells activated against leukemic cells. We used a CAR-T cell consisting of a CD33 binder and CD28z-OX40 costimulatory moiety. BM-MSC were exposed to the CAR following in vitro activation on CD33-coated plates for 24 hours. To model the different ways by which stromal cells can license their immunosuppressive activity, BM-MSC were exposed to the supernatant harvested from the cultures of activated CARs or in direct contact with the activated CARs themselves. After incubation with the CAR-conditioned medium (CAR-cm), BM-MSCs were investigated for their transcriptome by RNASeq. Gene ontology analysis of the transcriptome revealed a strong NF-κB and STAT1 signature in BM-MSC exposed to the CAR-cm compared to those which were not exposed. Amongst the most upregulated molecules, we identified several chemokines (CXCL10, CCL8, CXCL8, and CXCL9), PDL1 and CECAM1, IL-6, indoleamine-2,3 dyoxigenase (IDO), and most prominently PTGES and PTGS2. When CAR-cm licensed BM-MSC were incubated with CD33-activated CAR-T cells, we observed that CAR proliferation, cytotoxicity and cytokine production was significantly inhibited. CAR function was restored if Rel-A - a REL-associated protein critically involved in NF-κB heterodimer formation, nuclear translocation and activation - was inhibited in BM-MSC by shRNA before exposure to CAR-cm. We previously described that BM-MSC undergo apoptosis when in contact with activated cytotoxic T cells and that this also triggers their immunosuppressive capability. CD33-activated CAR-T cells were incubated with BM-MSC and the proportion of annexin-V positive BM-MSC was assessed after 4 hours. We observed that a large fraction of BM-MSC underwent apoptosis and that this was dependent on caspase activation and the release of cytolytic granules in a contact-dependent fashion. The supernatant of apoptotic BM-MSC but not the terminally apoptotic and neither the live cells exhibited a strong inhibitory activity on CAR-T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity and effector cytokine production. Similarly to what described with the CAR-cm induced profile, BM-MSC immunosuppression required NF-κB and was effected via the COX2 pathway. We finally tested the impact of apoMSC in vivo in a xenograft model of AML (Fig. 1). CD33-positive KG1 cells were injected in NSG mice and 2 weeks later, CD33-specific CAR-T were administered with or without (controls) apoMSC. Peripheral blood samples were collected 7, 14, and 21 days after. We observed an inhibitory effect of apoMSc on the in vivo expansion of CAR-T cells which was accompanied by disease progression. The addition of celecoxib at the time of infusion of apoMSC, restored the ability of CAR-T cell to expand in vivo and control leukemic cell increase in the peripheral blood.
 We conclude that BM-MSC can be induced to acquire immunosuppressive properties by activated CAR-T cells through 2 different but overlapping mechanisms, both dependent on NF-κB and COX2 signalling pathway. Our work provides critical information to overcome resistance to CAR-T cell treatment by neutralising the negative effects of the stromal microenvironment.

 Myelofibrosis (MF), driven by JAK/STAT signaling mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, has the worst survival rates among myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), worsening from pre-fibrotic MF (PFMF) to overt MF (OMF) that often precedes acute myeloid leukemia. We previously demonstrated that Natural Killer (NK) cells have phenotypical and functional alterations that predominate in MF when compared to other classical MPNs, suggesting that the immune content may contribute to disease burden. We hypothesized that the cytotoxic immune cell profile, along with fibrosis and mutations, drives MF progression. Aiming to characterize the cytotoxic immune cells of MF patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 9 PFMF and 9 OMF, and 9 healthy donors (controls: CT) were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry to profile: NK cell frequency and subtypes (CD45hiCD3-CD19-CD56brightCD16-; CD45hiCD3-CD19-CD56dimCD16+; NK maturation stages [CD57+ hypermature, CD11b- immature, CD11b+ mature; CD11b-CD27- tolerant (DN), CD27+CD11b- immature secretory (IS), CD27+CD11b+ mature secretory (MS), CD11b+CD27- cytotoxic]; T lymphocytes (CD45hiCD3+) frequency and subtypes (CD4, CD8) and maturation [CD45RO-CD45RA+CD27+ Naïve (N), CD45RO+CD45RA+CD27+ intermediate (INT), CD45RO+CD45RA+CD27- Central Effector (CE), CD45RO+CD45RA-CD27+ Central Memory (CM), CD45RO-CD45RA+CD27- End Stage (ES)]. Immune evasion was assessed by CD62L, and Treg cells (CD4+CD25hiCD127lowFOxp3+) were also quantified. NK cytotoxic capacity was measured by quantifying dead/K562 target cells, NK activation (CD69) and degranulation (CD107a) after PBMC co-culture.Top of FormBottom of Form Total lymphocyte frequency was reduced in MF vs CT (CT 53.3±19.4%, MF 40.9±24.2%, p=0.23) as well as in OMF vs PFMF (OMF 53.1±22%, PFMF 28.6±20.5%, p=0.02). CD56bright NK cells were increased and CD56dim decreased in MF vs CT (CD56bright: CT 3.4±2.6%, MF 17.7±17.9%, p<0.001; CD56dim: CT 82.7±7.6%, MF 53.4±25%, p<0.001). NK maturation profiles in MF showed increased immature NK cells (CT 4.7±3.7%, MF 15.1±8.9%, p=0.001), with higher DN (CT 4.5±3.5%, MF 13.9±8.7%, p=0.002) and IS (CT 0.2±0.3%, MF 1.2±1.2%, p=0.03), and lower cytotoxic NK cells (CT 92.1±3.8%, MF 77.3±11.2%, p<0.001). Of note, when compared to PFMF, OMF samples presented higher frequency of cytotoxic NK cells (PFMF 72.2±12%, OMF 82.4±7.9%, p=0.09), and a tendency to lower DN and MS frequencies. Similarly, hypermature NK frequency was slightly lower in MF compared to CT (CT 60.5±15.3%, MF 53.5±26.4%, p=0.4) but higher in OMF compared to PFMF (PFMF 45.5±25.7%, OMF 61.5±25.9%, p=0.1). In agreement, reduced NK cytotoxic capacity was observed despite increased degranulation in MF (death: CT 81.8±4.2%, MF 30.1±7.76%, p=0.02; CD107a: CT 11±5.2%, MF 21.1±14.7%, p=0.4) and slightly increased cytotoxicity and degranulation accompanied fibrosis (death: PFMF 28±6.4%, OMF 31.4±9.9%, p=0.7; CD107a: PFMF 10.1±8.8%, OMF 32.17±9.9%, p=0.1). No changes in total T lymphocytes or CD4/CD8 frequencies were seen between CT and MF or PFMF and OMF. However, CD8 effector compartment was reduced in MF (INT and CE subtypes: CT 19.8±9.9%, MF 7.3±12.2%, p<0.001; CT 19.1±16.4%, MF 8.1±13.8%, p=0.002) and decreased CD8 memory compartment (CM) was observed in OMF as compared to PFMF (PFMF 18.9±11.9%, OMF 10.6±9.5%, p=0.02). CD62L+ CM decreased in MF (CT 21.5±12.8%, MF 6.8±6.8%, p=0.006) and in OMF (PFMF 9.4±8%, OMF 3.9±3.7%, p=0.2), with a modest rise in CD62L- CM (PFMF 6.5±8.4%, OMF 13.1±9.9%, p=0.3). Treg frequency decreased in MF (CT 1.9±1.7%, MF 0.25±0.22%, p=0.01) but increased in OMF (PFMF 0.2±0.13%, OMF 0.3±0.2%, p=0.5). More advanced MF has a higher degree of fibrosis, which leads to an inflammatory profile in the disease. This, in turn, may activate NK cells and result in a more mature but cytotoxic-deficient profile probably due to exhaustion. On the other hand, increased Treg cells found in OMF negatively regulate cytotoxic T cells and its memory compartment, specifically leading to immune evasion via a decrease in CD62L+ CM, which is associated with a better anti-tumor response. The results shed light on the mechanisms involved in MF progression, suggesting that changes in the maturation profile of cytotoxic cells is associated with disease progression, thus inspiring new therapies that target antitumoral cells from the leukemic environment.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) remains among the most fatal cancers with few treatment modalities and resistance to modern immunotherapeutic treatment paradigms including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). ICIs neutralize the regulatory signals that disable T cells and have demonstrated remarkable efficacy against a variety of cancers, though not in GBM. The impotence of ICI in GBM has been linked to the tumor’s remarkable capacity to elicit T cell exhaustion, though the mechanism remains poorly understood. Chronic interferon (IFN) cytokine signaling is known to promote immunosuppression and Tex in several cancer types as well as resistance to ICI. However, the role of IFN in GBM has not been investigated despite evidence that IFN signatures exist within clinical samples of GBM. Syngeneic murine GBM cell lines CT2A and SB28 were utilized for in vivo and in vitro studies. Anti-mouse PD-1 and CD8 antibodies or PBS control were injected intraperitoneally. CRISPR editing was used to create validated knockouts (KO) of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) in CT2A. Mice bearing IFNAR1 KO intracranial tumors have improved median survival (p < 0.05) and are exquisitely sensitive to checkpoint anti-PD-1 blockade (p < 0.05) with the majority of mice surviving. Furthermore, surviving mice reject the subsequent intracranial re-challenge with parental CT2A tumors compared to controls (p <0.05) suggesting central memory responses mediating rejection. We conclude that abrogation of Type I IFN signaling is sufficient to extend survival which is further enhanced by ICI. Work is ongoing to further elucidate the precise mechanism that mediates this response and to identify a therapeutic intervention that enables tumor-specific inhibition of the IFN pathway with preliminary work suggesting a CD8 T cell mediated response and reversal of the T cell exhaustion phenotype.">

 Introduction: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic neoplasms (HR-MDS) remain challenging hematological malignancies with poor long-term outcomes. Novel strategies targeting leukemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPCs) are crucial to improve durable remissions. In that regard, CD123 expressed on LSPCs and leukemic blasts has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. We have demonstrated the preclinical efficacy of the bispecific CD123/CD16A innate cell engager AFM28 against CD123+ leukemic cells mediated by natural killer (NK) cells including its favorable safety outcome in cynomolgus monkey studies. Here, we investigated whether AFM28 alone could be preclinically effective by leveraging AML patient-derived NK cells to target autologous leukemic cells in addition to its potential in combination with allogeneic NK cell therapy. Moreover, we explored the preclinical effects of AFM28 on hematopoietic progenitors and LSPC derived from AML and HR-MDS patients.
 Methods: To assess the activity of AFM28 against leukemic blasts and LSPC, primary bone marrow (BM)-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs) of AML (n=5) and HR-MDS (n=5) patients were co-cultured with allogeneic NK cells from healthy donors in the presence of AFM28 for 24 h, followed by flow cytometric analysis of CD123+ leukemic cells including LSPCs defined as CD123+CD34+CD38−CD117+ cells. Colony forming unit (CFU) assays were performed using CD34+ MNCs derived from AML patients (n=5), HR-MDS patients (n=5) and healthy donors (n=5) after exposure to allogeneic NK cells and AFM28. In ex vivo assays, freshly drawn blood of newly diagnosed AML patients (n=7) was treated with AFM28 for 24 h with or without additional allogeneic NK cells.
 Results: In an autologous setting, AFM28 demonstrated activity against primary leukemic blasts in ex vivo cultures of fresh whole blood derived from untreated first diagnosis AML patients, indicating that AFM28 has the potential to arm AML patient's endogenous NK cells for anti-leukemic activity. Responder samples (n=3) showed a mean lysis of 76% (range 59-90%), while non-responders (n=4) exhibited a mean lysis of 7% (range 0-22%). The addition of healthy allogeneic NK cells could convert non-responders to responders and enhanced the overall anti-leukemic activity to 89% (range 77-100%) in previous responders and 66% (range 18-99%) in previous non-responders. Moreover, AFM28 induced the elimination of 98% of LSPCs (range 95-99%) in cultures using BM-MNCs of AML and HR-MDS patients supplemented with allogeneic NK cells. Depletion of LSPCs was corroborated by the concentration-dependent reduction in leukemic colony formation of AML (57-75% reduction) and HR-MDS BM-MNCs samples (57-64%), whereas colony formation of healthy BM-MNCs samples was only modestly affected (6-39%). Hence, AFM28 demonstrated specificity for leukemic cells while largely sparing healthy hematopoietic progenitors.
 Conclusion: This study highlights the potent efficacy of AFM28 in targeting CD123+ leukemic cells including LSPCs of AML and HR-MDS patients. Our results demonstrate that AFM28 monotherapy has the potential to mediate anti-leukemic activity by leveraging the endogenous innate immunity in some AML patients. The anti-leukemic activity of AFM28 may be further increased in combination with allogeneic NK cell immunotherapy to improve responses in patients with low numbers and/or hypofunctional NK cells.

 【Background】
 Interactions of multiple myeloma (MM) cells with cellular and non-cellular components in the bone marrow milieu, such as cytokines, metabolites and exosomes, are important in the pathogenesis of MM. Stromal cells are an important component of the MM tumor microenvironment (TME) and promote the development of drug resistance. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), an enzyme that metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine, has been reported to cause T cell exhaustion and increase regulatory T cells, thus acting as an immunosuppressive factor in the TME of some cancers. However, the status of IDO has not been fully investigated regarding the immune milieu of MM. We previously demonstrated that both primary MM samples and MM cell lines exhibit little or no IDO expression, but that its expression on stromal cell lines was upregulated by co-culture with MM cells (A. Asano et al. Hematol Oncol 2023; 41: 424-433). Here, we analyzed the mechanism of IDO upregulation in stromal cells co-cultured with MM cells, and investigated whether the upregulation of IDO expression is prevented by IDO inhibitors.
 【Materials and Methods】
 Stromal cells were incubated with MM cell lines or primary MM cells derived from patients, and the expression of IDO and related immune checkpoint markers was evaluated. Mechanisms of IDO upregulation were investigated using two strategies, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of stromal cells co-incubated with MM cell lines and cytokine assays of MM cell culture supernatant. In addition, cardiac glycosides (CGs), which are reported to be inhibitors of IDO expression (MA Shandell et al. J Biol Chem 2022; 298, 101707) were tested for their effects on the expression of IDO on stromal cells co-incubated with MM cells. Similarly, using cytokine-neutralizing antibodies, the roles of specific cytokines for the upregulation IDO expression were examined.
 【Results】
 Of the several MM cell lines tested, XG-7 and IM-9 were found to upregulate IDO expression inthe stromal cell lines UBE6T-7 and HS-5. IDO upregulation was also observed when primary stromal cells from patients with MM were tested. Expression of PD-L1, reported to be an activation marker associated with IDO expression, was also upregulated. Cytokine detection assays showed that MM cell lines that upregulated IDO on stromal cells tended to produce more IL-12 than cell lines that did not. RNA-Seq analysis of UBE6T-7 co-incubated with XG-7 and IM-9 showed significant upregulation of the transcription factors STAT1, STAT2 and IRF1 and pathways enriched in viral defense responses, innate immune responses, lipoprotein metabolism and cellular responses to IFN-γ. We also found IL-12 receptor β subunit 1, which is associated with inflammatory responses, was upregulated in UBE6T-7 co-incubated with both XG-7 and IM-9. These results suggest that specific cytokines and their receptors are involved in elevating IDO levels in stromal cells. Next, to evaluate the effect of CGs, we added ouabain or digoxin to cultures of stromal cells previously co-incubated with MM cell lines. We found that these CGs prevented the upregulation of IDO expression on stromal cells. Based on the results of RNA-seq analysis and cytokine detection assays, we hypothesize that IL-12 and related signaling pathways are associated with the elevation of IDO on stromal cells. Adding Ustekinumab, an IL-12 neutralizing antibody, tended to suppress the upregulation of IDO expression on stromal cells co-incubated with MM cells. According to a previous report, IL-32γ is highly expressed in MM patients and induces IDO production in macrophages via activation of JAK-STAT pathways. Accordingly, we found that recombinant human IL-32γ upregulated IDO expression onstromal cells to some extent.
 【Conclusion】
 MM cells may enhance the immunosuppressive function of stromal cells by upregulating IDO expression. Two cytokines, IL-12 and IL-32γ, and related pathways may be associated with IDO upregulation on stromal cells via activated JAK-STAT pathways. This immunosuppressive milieu may contribute to the poor efficacy, refractoriness, and acquired resistance to immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. IDO inhibitors, CGs, and targeting the IL-12 and IL-32γ pathways may improve the TME in MM and positively influence immunotherapy outcomes.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Despite the success of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combination therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its effectiveness remains confined to a subset of patients. The development of reliable, predictive markers is important for accurate patient stratification and further mechanistic understanding of therapy response. Methods We comprehensively analyzed paired single-cell RNA transcriptome and T-cell repertoire profiles from 14 HCC ascites samples, collected from 7 patients before and after treatment with the combination of sintilimab (anti-PD-1) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF). Results We identify a widespread convergence on interferon (IFN) signaling across various immune cell lineages in treatment-responsive patients with HCC, indicating a common transcriptional state transition in the immune microenvironment linked to immunotherapy response in HCC. Strong IFN signaling marks CD8+ T cells with larger clonal expansion and enhanced cytotoxicity, macrophages toward M1-like polarization and strong T-cell recruitment ability, dendritic cells with increased antigen presentation capacity, as well as highly cytotoxic natural killer cells and activated B cells. By translating our finding to cohorts of patients with HCC, we demonstrate the specificity of IFN-signaling in the prognosis of patients with HCC and its ability to predict immunotherapy response. Conclusions This study provides a unique single-cell resource with clonal and longitudinal resolution during ICI therapy and reveals IFN signaling as a biomarker of immunotherapy response in HCC, suggesting a beneficial effect by combining IFN inducers with ICIs for patients with HCC.">

 Introduction: Cytokine storm (CS) is a severe hyperinflammatory disorder characterized by the overproduction of diverse inflammatory cytokines, manifesting as high fever, vascular leakage, nausea, hypotension, and even multi-organ failure. CS can occur as a complication in various conditions, primarily chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These represent the three major triggers of CS: iatrogenic causes, infections, and autoimmune conditions. Given the heterogeneity of CS triggers, the clinical features and immune landscapes of CS vary widely, necessitating tailored management strategies. However, the detailed immune profiles of CS across these diverse settings are not well characterized, hindering the identification of common and distinct mechanisms underlying this hyperinflammatory complication.
 Methods and Results: Here, we constructed a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in CS with data from three representative disease settings: CAR-T cell therapy, COVID-19, and SLE. The total sample count is 416, encompassing 2,304,606 cells. We collected 111 samples from multiple myeloma (MM) patients who received anti-BCMA CAR-T treatment and experienced CS events at our center, with ethical approval and informed consent from all participants. The scRNA-seq data for COVID-19 (n=221), SLE (n=40), and healthy donor controls (n=44) were retrieved from online open-access publications. Samples from the progression stage of each disease showed significantly elevated expression of CS-related genes, indicating an inflammatory status. We further analyzed the enriched cellular subclusters and expression profiles of these samples to reveal the unique CS landscape of each disease. The results showed that CS following CAR-T therapy was strongly associated with actively proliferating CD8+ T cells, with gene expressions enriched in T cell function-related pathways, such as MAPK and NLR signaling pathways. We also identified an increased percentage of CD8+ exhausted T cells in CS following CAR-T therapy, which might significantly contribute to the abnormal inflammatory responses. Moreover, COVID-19 progression was characterized by unique dynamics of myeloid immune cells, particularly CD14+ monocytes with S100A8 expression and neutrophils with enhanced interferon signaling. Interestingly, in myeloid immune cells from the COVID-19 progression stage, KEGG analysis revealed significantly enriched expressions of genes involved in neuronal transduction, suggesting the potential crosstalk between systemic inflammation and neuronal functions. In SLE, translation activities and ribosome functions were significantly elevated in B cells and plasma cells. Additionally, myeloid immune cells in SLE were enriched for genes involved in phagocytosis, antigen processing, and antigen presentation, showing the over-active status of phagocytotic monocytes/macrophages, which contributes to systemic inflammation.
 Significance: Our large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of CS in three distinct disease contexts uncovered the unique and shared immune landscapes underlying CS across different conditions. Our findings highlight the distinct contributions of specific immune cell subclusters and signaling pathways in each disease context, suggesting potential targets for tailored therapeutic strategies and advancing our understanding of this complex hyperinflammatory complication.

 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, heterogenous autoimmune disorder characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and treatment responses due to various genetic, epigenetic, and immune-related factors (Kaul et al., 2016). SLE is characterized by the expansion of a rare B cell subset, double negative (DN), with the majority of these being DN2 cells (ZEB2hiITGAXhi, Jenks et al., 2018). These cells are known to be the main cause of SLE pathogenicity, and are precursors of pathogenic antibody secreting cells (Elsner & Shlomchik, 2020). SLE patients can experience several life threatening complications, including a 3-fold higher risk of developing hematological malignancies, particularly B cell lymphomas (Clarke et al., 2021). While recent studies have linked mutations involved in B cell clonal expansion to alterations in SLE pathogenesis-driving cells, there is limited direct clinical evidence on how this malignancy transformation begins (Pullabhatla et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2020; Venturutti et al., 2023). Therefore, studying DN2 cells in autoimmune disorders represents a unique opportunity to identify transcriptional, genetic and epigenetic alterations that might serve as pre-malignancy indicators in these patients.
 To characterize the somatic mutational landscape of active and inactive B-cells in SLE, we profiled a cohort of 14 SLE patients and 3 healthy controls (HC) using whole-exome sequencing. Three subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sorted: naïve B cells [CD19+IgD+], memory B cells [CD19+IgD-CD27+] and DN B cells [CD19+IgD-CD27-]. Using nf-core/sarek (Garcia et al., 2020), we identified several somatic alterations in the DN cell population that were previously found in lymphoid malignancies, such as EP300, a histone acetyltransferase (Huang et al., 2021), ITPKB, a kinase involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling (Tiacci et al., 2018), and DUSP22 tumor suppressor (Melart et al., 2016). These findings suggest the possibility of DN2 cells as precursors of lymphoid cancers, thus prompting the need to further characterize DN2 cellular state.
 To investigate the transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in DN2 cells, we conducted single-cell multiome sequencing on a pilot cohort of 4 SLE patients. In total we analyzed 34,472 cells from the SLE cohort including 2,664 DN2 cells, and 24,162 cells from the HC samples including 2,571 DN cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed significant enrichment of Interferon (IFN) Alpha and Gamma in the SLE DN2 cells, and over-expression of CD86 compared to HC-DN cells, as previously reported (Jenks et al., 2018). However, by analyzing variations in transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNA using consensus non-negative matrix factorization, we uncovered a unique and novel expression program in SLE DN2 cells that was absent in HC DN cells. This program was enriched in hematological malignancy-associated IFN/MHC class I and II pathways previously found in heme-related cancers (Gavish et al., 2023). This indicates an inherent bias in SLE DN2 cells towards a more malignant phenotype.
 Further, we discovered that highly accessible genes in SLE DN2 cells were enriched in a signature corresponding to activated B cell diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) state 4 cells (Steen et al., 2021). These cells are identified as pre-plasmablast DLBCL cells and exhibit a more aggressive and unfavorable phenotype associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Motif enrichment analysis in open chromatin regions of SLE DN2 cells further revealed enrichment of the POU family of transcription factors (TFs), such as POU2F2 (encoding OCT2) and POU3F1 (encoding OCT-6) among others. OCT2 is known to be highly active in B cells, and a mutated form of this TF, has been found in various lymphomas with a different repertoire of targets (Hodson et al., 2016). Interestingly, the POU2F2 gene harbors a frameshift mutation in the Memory and DN subsets of an active SLE patient in our cohort.
 In summary, we identified distinctive transcriptional and epigenetic profiles in SLE DN2 cells, enriched in pathways associated with hematological malignancies and containing key oncogenic mutations. These findings suggest that the malignant phenotypic alterations in DN2 cells could serve as biomarkers of pre-malignancy, providing new insights into the pathogenesis and potential transformation of autoimmune diseases into malignancies.

 Early-stage clinical trials in glioblastoma (GBM) have tested various virotherapy strategies, yet only a subset of patients appear to benefit. We previously demonstrated that a recombinant poliovirus (PVSRIPO) functions by inducing MDA5-dependent, type I interferon (IFN) dominant innate inflammation in myeloid cells to provoke durable and functional antitumor T cell responses in mice. Long-term survival after intratumoral PVSRIPO infusion was observed in a subset of patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM) in two clinical trials. Survival after PVSRIPO was associated with higher pre-treatment intratumoral neutrophil density and MHC-class II gene expression, but also higher pre-treatment inflammatory cytokines in blood. Post-treatment induction of type I/III IFNs detected in blood one day after PVSRIPO infusion also associated with survival of patients with rGBM, suggesting that the proficiency of IFN responses to PVSRIPO may dictate therapy outcome. In human ex vivo glioma tissue assays, only a subset of gliomas mounted type I IFN responses to PVSRIPO and STING agonist treatment, in a manner linked with higher pre-treatment IL-1b levels, and lower CXCL10 induction after treatment. Thus, baseline innate inflammation either influences or reflects the capacity of glioma tumors to respond to virotherapy. Strikingly, in glioma bearing mice, peripheral vaccination against tumor irrelevant vaccines in alum adjuvant (i.e., against antigens not expressed by the tumor) induced bone marrow, spleen and intratumoral innate inflammation; rescued the antitumor efficacy of PVSRIPO in an otherwise refractory glioma model; and improved survival after intratumor STING agonist therapy. Notably, peripheral vaccination induced intratumoral neutrophil and CD4+ T cell inflammation, and increased MHC-class II expression on myeloid cells. These data imply a role for pre-treatment systemic innate immune training in the antitumor efficacy of virotherapy and indicate that modulating either systemic innate inflammation and/or the inflammatory status of bone marrow myeloid progenitors may sensitize gliomas to virotherapy.">

 Follicular lymphomas (FLs) arise from germinal center (GC) B cells and contain a rich tumor microenvironment (TME) including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and lymphoid stromal cells, among which follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are particularly abundant. FDCs interact with GC B cells through antigen presentation, secretion of BAFF, which binds to BAFFR to induce trophic signals, and secretion of CXCL13, which draws B cells into GCs via CXCR5. While the role of FDCs in FL is not fully understood, BAFFR expression has been associated with worse outcomes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We hypothesized that FDCs 1) play a critical role in FL, primarily through BAFF signaling, 2) represent a therapeutic target in FL, and 3) are most amenable to targeting as a form of early intervention therapy for FL.
 We profiled the FL TME of 151 patient biopsies at the spatial level using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and found that FDCs were highly prevalent and in close proximity to FL B cells. We previously showed that FDCs are especially abundant in both human and murine EZH2Y641F gain-of-function mutant FLs. To determine the functional relevance of these FDCs and the potential relevance of BAFF, we administered anti-BAFF blocking antibody to immunized mice bearing 50% WT and 50% mutant EZH2 B cells. BAFF blockade caused significantly greater depletion of EZH2Y641F GC B cells relative to WT (p<0.05), documenting a critical role for FDCs and BAFF in EZH2 mutant GC B cells.
 We generated and credentialed a bona fide FL mouse model, driven by GC-specific expression of BCL2 and EZH2Y641F. These EZH2/BCL2 mice develop lymphoid hyperplasia at 5 months and FL at 8 months. To investigate the changing composition of the TME in FL, we immunized a cohort of 25 EZH2/BCL2 mice and sacrificed 5 mice at 5 time points between 6 and 11 months. We extracted RNA from spleen containing lymphoma cells and the entire TME and performed qPCR on 93 genes, including cytokines and chemokines involved in GC intercellular signaling. BAFF transcript abundance was increased in EZH2/BCL2 relative to WT mice at all timepoints (p<0.05), supporting BAFF as potentially biologically relevant in FL.
 Given the relevance of the BAFF-BAFFR axis and mutant EZH2 dependency on FDCs, we next investigated the effects of BAFF and EZH2 inhibition on FL incidence and TME composition. We treated 40 immunized EZH2/BCL2 mice biweekly with anti-BAFF or IgG control beginning at 6 months. Mice also received 3 weeks of tazemetostat (taz), an EZH2 inhibitor approved in FL, or vehicle (veh) before sacrifice at 7 months (recapitulating early FL) and 11 months (late FL) (n=20 per timepoint). We analyzed splenic tissues by histology, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence (IF) imaging. Combined anti-BAFF + taz, and to a lesser extend anti-BAFF, delayed the onset and progression of FL. Anti-BAFF increased the recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into follicular areas in both early (p<0.001) and late (p<0.05) timepoints. This was enhanced by taz at the late timepoint (1.5-fold, p<0.05). IF showed that BAFF blockade decreased FDC contacts with FL B cells (1.9-fold) and T cells (2.6-fold) at the early timepoint. In contrast, at the late timepoint, anti-BAFF increased FDC contacts with FL B cells (1.7-fold) but not T cells. Similarly, anti-BAFF decreased CXCL13+ FDCs at the early timepoint (1.7-fold) but increased CXCL13+ FDCs at the late timepoint (0.6-fold). These findings suggest that BAFF inhibition increases T cell involvement in FL and decreases FL incidence, though these effects are later reversed, potentially through compensatory resistance mechanisms or neutralizing antibodies against anti-BAFF. Notably, the presence of CXCL13+ FDCs was linked to inferior PFS in our cohort of FL patients profiled by IMC (p<0.001) and CXCL13 transcripts were progressively increased in our EZH2/BCL2 mice analyzed at various timepoints as compared to WT. CXCL13 expression may highlight active FDCs, which decrease at the early timepoint with BAFF inhibition and later recur as FL progresses.
 Overall, we identify FDCs as a therapeutic target in FL and highlight the additive effects of EZH2 inhibition. We further establish a critical treatment window early in FL at which point BAFF and EZH2 inhibition increase T cell involvement within the TME and prevent FL formation. These findings reveal a promising strategy for treating FL early in its disease course and potentially for enhancing T cell-based immunotherapies.

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by poor prognosis and remains a challenging disease to treat. New therapeutic approaches are being introduced, and natural killer (NK) cell-based immunotherapy has been recognized as a promising option. However, which subgroups of AML patients that are most likely to respond to NK cell therapy, remain undefined. We explored the susceptibility of AML cells to NK cell cytotoxicity in ex vivo co-cultures.
 We analyzed leukemic cell sensitivity to NK cells using vitally frozen bone marrow (BM) samples from 99 AML patients at diagnosis and expanded NK cells from one healthy donor. BM samples were exposed to NK cells at five effector-to-target (E:T) ratios 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1 and 8:1, followed by a flow cytometry-based killing assay. We also performed multiplexed single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-RNAseq) to understand how NK and BM cells responded transcriptomically to their interaction. We characterized the clinical features of the AML cohort and integrated the information with sensitivity and transcriptomic data to reveal the clinical and molecular drivers behind leukemic cell susceptibility to NK cell killing.
 The cohort displayed a diversity of molecular subtypes and a balanced distribution across the 2022 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk groups (favorable n=27, intermediate n=34, adverse n=35). The international consensus classification (ICC) of AML mapped the patients into allcategories, ranging in size from 2.0% to 53.5%. The cohort also exhibited diversity in their French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, M0 (n=4), M1 (n=23), M2 (n=23), M3 (n=2), M4 (n=10), M5 (n=17), M6 (n=2), mixed subtype (n=14), undefined (n=4). The median age of patients was 63 (range 27-82) years.
 The flow cytometry killing assay uncovered the AML blast populations. 60% of samples had CD34+ myeloblasts, 40% CD34- myeloblasts and 32% CD14+ monocytic-like blasts, with half of the CD14+ samples being CD34+. All blast populations displayed prominent heterogeneity to NK cell cytotoxicity, indicating the presence of both sensitive and resistant AML subgroups. The median killing of myeloblasts spanned from 13.3% (range 0%-75.7%) at 1:1 E:T ratio to 31.3% (range 0%-92.3%) at the highest ratio. We further measured sensitivity to NK cells by calculating the area under the dose-response curve (AUC) capturing the effect of all E:T ratios in each sample. The median AUC for myeloblasts was 81.8. Samples with mutated BCOR (n=6) and RAS oncogenes (n=27), including KRAS, NF1 and NRAS, showed increased sensitivity to NK cytotoxicity with significantly lower AUC values, 59.3 and 69.8 (Mann-Whitneyp = .004 and p = .005) respectively, compared to cases lacking these mutations. NK cytotoxicity was especially predominant in CD34+ myeloblasts. The overall AUC median for CD34+ blasts was 76.3. BCOR (n=5) mutated cases had a median of 48.1 and RAS oncogenes (n=16) 63.4. CD14+ blasts were more prone to NK killing with a median of 21.8. Killing of CD34+ and CD14+ blasts correlated for samples exhibiting both myeloblasts and monocytic-like blasts (Spearman rs= .66, p = .006).
 Sc-RNAseq identified tumor-induced activation states in expanded NK cells upon interaction with AML cells. The percentage of NK cells displaying an activated phenotype correlated with increased killing of both CD34+ (Spearman rs= -.56, p < .001) and CD14+ (Spearman rs= -.51, p = .003) blasts. The median NK activation for CD34+ samples was 45.8%. Both BCOR and RAS mutated CD34+ samples triggered significantly higher responses in NK cells, with median activations of 80.2% and 67.2% (Mann-Whitneyp = .01 and p = .02) respectively. NF1 mutated cases induced the highest NK activation median, 83.6%, among the RAS oncogenes.
 Our study demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in sensitivity of AML cells to NK cytotoxicity. The findings reveal that AML patients with BCOR and RAS mutations, are more sensitive to NK killing, especially in CD34+ myeloblasts. The sc-RNAseq data showed that NK activation correlates with enhanced killing of CD34+ and CD14+ blasts. The variability in NK cell cytotoxicity against AML cells within our diverse cohort highlights the possibility of adoptive cell therapies in distinct patient subgroups. Our study improves the understanding of clinical and transcriptomic factors that affect immune clearance of AML cells, enhancing the therapeutic potential of NK cell-based approaches in AML treatment.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with a median overall survival (mOS) of 14 months. Treatment options are limited with no new approved therapies over the past 3 decades and no standard of care for a majority of patients (> 90%) who experience recurrence. GBM has a highly immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) comprising of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) that are capable of suppressing the activity of anti-cancer CD8+ T and NK cells. We have engineered highly selective IL-2 superkines (IL-2SK) that preferentially expand and activate CD8+ T and NK cells with limited effects on immune suppressive regulatory T cells (i.e., Tregs). MDNA11 is an IL-2SK -albumin fusion protein designed to increase half-life and promote tumor accumulation. MDNA223 is a bi-functional anti-PD1-IL-2SK designed to stimulate effector immune cells while preventing immune exhaustion. MDNA11 and MDNA223 extended survival of mice harboring orthotopic GBM tumors with accompanying increase in CD8+ T and NK cells within the TME. When patient-derived GBM tumor explants were treated with MDNA11 and MDNA223 ex vivo, there was clear evidence of activation among resident CD8+ T cells characterized by increased levels of intra-cellular Granzyme B responsible for tumor cell killing. There was also increased release of soluble Fas ligand and granulysin, consistent with an activated anti-tumor immune response within the TME. Ongoing studies include in depth immune profiling to further understand the mechanism of MDNA11 and MDNA223 in GBM as well as to test potential synergy with tumor targeting therapeutics and other treatment modalities capable of eliciting immunogenic cell death.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as an effective, personalized treatment for certain patients, particularly for those with hematological malignancies. However, its efficacy in breast cancer has been marginal—perhaps due to cold, immune-excluded, or immune-desert tumors. Natural killer T (NKT) cells play a critical role in cancer immune surveillance and are reduced in cancer patients. Thus, we hypothesized that NKT cells could serve as a surrogate marker for immune function. In order to assess which breast cancer patients would likely benefit from immune cell-based therapies, we have developed a quantitative method to rapidly assess NKT function using stimulation with artificial antigen presenting cells followed by quantitative real-time PCR for IFN-γ. We observed a significant reduction in the percentage of circulating NKT cells in breast cancer patients, compared to healthy donors; however, the majority of patients had functional NKT cells. When we compared BC patients with highly functional NKT cells, as indicated by high IFN-γ induction, to those with little to no induction, following stimulation of NKT cells, there was no significant difference in NKT cell number between the groups, suggesting functional loss has more impact than physical loss of this subpopulation of T cells. In addition, we assessed the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression within the tumor microenvironment in the low and high responders. Further characterization of immune gene signatures in these groups identified a concomitant decrease in the induction of TNFα, LAG3, and LIGHT in the low responders. We next investigated the mechanisms by which breast cancers suppress NKT-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. We found that breast cancers secrete immunosuppressive lipids, and treatment with commonly prescribed medications that modulate lipid metabolism, can reduce tumor growth and restore NKT cell responses.">

 Introduction: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is indicated for the treatment of many hematological diseases, including leukemia. The goal is to eradicate residual leukemic cells and to replace the recipient's diseased stem cells with healthy ones from a donor. However, this therapy's success is limited by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), caused by allogeneic T cells that recognize the recipient's body as foreign and attack its tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.
 We have previously shown that neutrophils can exacerbate tissue damage caused by conditioning regimens, particularly in the small intestine (SI), and amplify the immune response by releasing inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting T cell activation. In in vivo models of aGVHD, neutrophil depletion improves survival. However, neutrophils also play an important role in tissue homeostasis. Thus, inhibition of the pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils could be an interesting therapeutic target of aGVHD. RLS-0071 (Pegtarazimod) is a synthetic peptide derived and optimized from the capsid protein of human astrovirus serotype 1 (HAstV-1). RLS-0071 has previously been shown to have multiple modes of action, including inhibition of the classical and lectin pathways of the complement system as well as reduction of NET formation and inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, resulting in reduced ROS, which makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of aGVHD.
 Methods: The effect of RLS-0071 was tested using different major mismatch models of aGVHD in which mice were treated with the peptide or a vehicle. Survival, clinical symptoms and tissue damage were examined. The underlying mechanism was investigated using different methods, including flow cytometry of immune cells in GVHD target organs, ELISA of pro-inflammatory proteins in the serum, and qPCR to investigate gene expression in target cell types and tissues.
 Results: RLS-0071 significantly improves the survival of mice in multiple in vivo models of aGVHD, both when treatment is used to prevent the development of aGVHD and to alleviate existing aGVHD. Furthermore, it reduces clinical symptoms and decreases tissue damage in GVHD target organs. Mechanistically, RLS-0071 reduces inflammation by decreasing ROS production both in vitro and in vivo and lowering levels of the NET marker neutrophil elastase in vivo. In addition, inflammatory cytokines are reduced in splenic neutrophils and in the SI of mice with aGVHD. Additionally, RLS-0071 could also be protective for intestinal cells, as preliminary in vitro experiments with cell lines and organoids of epithelial cells of the small intestine suggest.
 Conclusion: Our results suggest the use of RLS-0071 (Pegtarazimod) for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of aGVHD. Further mechanistic studies will provide additional knowledge on the mechanism of action. Based on these promising results, RLS-0071 will be evaluated in a phase 2, open label clinical trial for hospitalized patients with acute GVHD (NCT06343792).

 A hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM) is an immunosuppressive microenvironment that is partially driven by tumor cell-derived secreted factors, highlighting the need for a more complete understanding of local immune suppressive mechanism. Altered secreted metabolite levels are observed in the GBM microenvironment; specifically, spermidine (a polyamine), which functions to drive cell proliferation, apoptosis, T cell lineage commitment, and myeloid cell-mediated suppression. However, the direct link between GBM cell-derived spermidine and the tumor microenvironment has yet to be determined. In syngeneic mouse GBM models, spermidine levels were increased in the tumor microenvironment and exogenous administration of spermidine accelerated tumor aggressiveness in an immune dependent-manner. Mechanistically, spermidine administration increased apoptosis of CD8+ T-cells and generated an exhausted phenotype. When ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1, the rate limiting enzyme in spermidine synthesis), was knocked down in tumor cells, no direct effect was observed on tumor cell growth. However, there was an increase in time to tumor succumbence and a concomitant increase in CD8+ T-cells and decrease in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. In GBM patients, there was a negative correlation between ODC1 expression and CD8+ T-cells present near the tumor. Additionally, patients with a favorable prognosis had significantly lower intratumoral levels of spermidine compared to patients with a poor prognosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that spermidine functions as a tumor cell-derived metabolite that drives tumor progression through reducing CD8+T cell number and altering their phenotype. These findings have clinical implications as clinical trials using a polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor alone have not been very effective in GBM patients, suggesting the need for additional combination immunotherapies. Finally, spermidine is also produced at prominent levels by commensal gut microbes as well as absorbed from consumption of foods such as mushrooms; investigation into how these distal spermidine sources impact GBM growth via the gut-brain axis is actively ongoing.">

 Survival of normal and transformed B-lymphocytes hinges on signals emanating from the B cell receptor (BCR), rendering the BCR a preferred target of therapy. In the λ-MYC murine B cell lymphoma model, we previously showed that inducible extinction of BCR signals leads to reduced competitive fitness of the malignant B cells, which could be corrected inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3 catalytic function. In addition to tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms, we hypothesized that extinction of BCR signals influenced lymphoma immune surveillance. To address this, we performed longitudinal studies in mice reconstituted with BCR-proficient and -deficient λ-MYC lymphoma cells, combining estimation of absolute number and phenotype of malignant B cells, with immune cell characterization in tumor-infiltrated primary (bone marrow, BM) and secondary (spleen, SPL and lymph node) lymphoid organs. Intravenous inoculation of BCR-expressing λ-MYC lymphomas favored efficient engraftment and rapid proliferation of tumor cells in the bone marrow and spleen of immuno-competent syngeneic hosts. Conversely, λ-MYC lymphomas transplanted after inducible genetic BCR extinction, suffered from a significant delay in in vivo expansion, as revealed by flow cytometric and histological analyses. Transplantation of λ-MYC lymphomas into immunodeficient NOS/SCID/IL2R common-gamma chain deficient mice lacking B/T and Natural killer (NK) cells, showed a significant acceleration in in vivo tumor growth irrespective of BCR status. These results implicate effective adaptive immune cell clearance of λ-MYC lymphomas, in particular upon extinction of BCR signals. Immune cell profiling of tumor-infiltrated bone marrow of immunocompetent mice revealed an enrichment for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and NK1.1+ NK cells at sites of BCR-less lymphoma growth, when compared to their BCR+ counterparts. CD8+ T cells infiltrating isles of BCR-less MYC lymphomas in BM and SPL expressed the proliferation marker Ki-67 and interferon gamma indicative of local activation. Antibody-mediated depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly improved recovery of BCR- lymphoma cells in lymphoid organs of transplanted mice, yet never normalizing those of BCR+ counterparts. In contrast, depletion of NK1.1+ NK cells showed a dramatic improvement of λ-MYC lymphoma growth in vivo, in particular in tumor inoculated after BCR extinction. Mechanistically, BCR inactivation causes significant reduction in MHC-class-I levels via downregulation of the transcription factor NLRC5, matched to increased surface expression of ligands for the NK cell activating receptor NKG2D. In vitro NK cytotoxicity assays showed preferential killing of BCR-less MYC lymphoma cells by NK cells, inhibited by NKG2D blocking antibodies. Serial transplantation of BCR-less lymphomas into immunocompetent hosts selected variants with improved immune cell evasion. Comparison of Ig-less tumor cells collected from early and late passages pointed to increased MHC-I surface levels, enhanced PI3K activity and BCR restoration via Rag1/2-dependent secondary IgH variable gene rearrangements as recurrent mechanisms to evade NK cell killing. Altogether, our results assign a central role to the BCR in protecting MYC-driven lymphomas from host immune cell clearance. In particular, we reveal the essential contribution of NK cells to counteract in vivo growth of BCR-less lymphomas, via engagement of the NKG2D receptor in a context of reduced tumor MHC-I expression. Our findings highlight the potential to boost lymphoma/leukemia therapies based on inhibitors of BCR signaling combining them with NK cell-engaging immunotherapies. The latter treatments may also become useful for the treatment of emerging mature aggressive B cell lymphomas lacking BCR expression (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.13.603066).

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

 Our group previously demonstrated that adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) significantly increased overall survival in mice across several brain cancer models. ACT remodels the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a pleiotropic manner, and specifically depletes immunosuppressive cells like myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which are a significant barrier to efficacious immunotherapy responses. This led us to hypothesize that ACT depletes MDSCs from the glioma microenvironment by inhibiting MDSC proliferation and migration, thereby overcoming glioma immunosuppression.



 We quantified MDSC cell cycle, apoptosis, and localization in the TME and peripheral lymphoid tissues using flow cytometry as well as chemokines in the TME from glioma-bearing mice treated with ACT. C57BL/6J mice intracranially received KR158b-luciferase glioma and were treated with ACT. After treatment, MDSC cell cycle was quantified using bromodeoxyuridine and 7-aminoactinomycin to define cell cycle phases. MDSC apoptosis and cell death states were quantified by measuring annexin-V and propidium iodide. Anatomic localization of MDSCs was measured by comparing host (CD45.2) and transferred HSC-derived cell markers (CD45.1) in the TME and spleen. A multiplex array was performed using tumor lysates to quantify cytokine and chemokine levels within the TME.



 We observed that MDSCs in the TME were significantly less proliferative and exhibited significantly increased levels of apoptosis and cell death after ACT. HSC-derived MDSCs were significantly enriched in the spleen of ACT-treated mice, but both transferred HSC-derived MDSCs and host MDSCs were depleted in the TME. Finally, ACT significantly decreased several chemokines in the TME, including interleukin-16 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-5.



 These results indicate that ACT shifts MDSC cell cycle states away from proliferation towards cell death, and inhibits peripheral recruitment to the TME. Our investigation revealed novel, myeloproliferative chemokines that are decreased by ACT, representing a novel mechanism underlying disrupted MDSC migration to the glioma microenvironment and ultimately to overcoming glioma-mediated immunosuppression.

        <tr id="Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly prevalent and heterogeneous among adult acute leukemias. Current chemotherapeutic approaches for AML often face the challenge of drug resistance, and AML immune cells play an important role in the regulation of AML drug resistance. Thus, it is of key significance to explore the regulatory mechanisms of immune cells in AML to alleviate chemotherapy resistance in AML. Methods Based on AML single-cell transcriptomic data, this study revealed the differences in the expression of immune cell subpopulations and marker genes in AML patients in the complete remission group (CR) compared to AML patients in the non-complete remission group (non-CR) after chemotherapy. Functional enrichment by clusterprofiler revealed the regulatory functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AML. AUCell enrichment scores were used to assess the immunoregulatory functions of immune cells. Pseudotime analysis was used to construct immune cell differentiation trajectories. CellChat was used for cellular communication analysis to elucidate the interactions between immune cells. Survival analysis with the R package “survival” revealed the role of immune cell marker genes on AML prognosis. Finally, the wound healing and trans-well assay were performed. Results Single-cell clustering analysis revealed that NK/T cells and macrophage cells subpopulations were significantly higher in non-CR AML patients than in CR AML. AUCell enrichment analysis revealed that FCAR+ and FCGR3A+ macrophages were significantly more active in the non-CR group and correlated with processes regulating cellular energy metabolism and immune cell activity. Differentially expressed NK cell marker genes between CR and non-CR groups mainly included HBA1, S100A8, and S100A9, which were associated with cancer drug resistance regulation, these marker genes of (FCAR, FCGR3A, PREX1, S100A8 and S100A9) were upregulated in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (HAP1) and silencing of S100A8 affected migration and invasion of HAP1 cells. In particular, the differentiation pathways of macrophages and NK cells in non-CR differed from those of patients in the CR group. Cellular communication analyses showed that ligand-receptor pairs between NK cells and macrophage cells mainly included HLA-E-KLRK1, HLA-E-KLRC1, HLA-E-CD94:NKG2A, CLEC2B-KLRB1. In addition, LGALS9-CD45, CCL3L1- CCR1, CCL3-CCR1 between these two immune cells mainly regulate secreted signaling to mediate AML progression. Marker genes in NK/T cells and macrophage cells were significantly associated with AML prognosis. Conclusion This study reveals the potential role of NK cells and macrophages in AML chemoresistance through the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. This provides new ideas and insights into the key mechanisms of immune cells in AML treatment.">

 CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CART19) cell therapy has shown outstanding clinical success. However, patients can develop CART-induced toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Studies have found that activation of myeloid cells by granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can contribute to toxicity development. GM-CSF depletion leads to reduced myeloid activation, prevention of CART-induced toxicities, and improved CART efficacy. CART cells upregulate cytokine receptors upon activation, and our results indicate that CART19 cells significantly upregulate GMCSFR upon antigen-specific stimulation (<10% vs >30%, p<0.01). This led us to hypothesize that GMCSFR signaling contributes to CART cell activity.
 To understand the role of GM-CSFR upregulation on CART cell functions, we compared the impacts of neutralizing GM-CSF or blocking GM-CSF receptor alpha (GM-CSFRα) on CART19.
 First, 4-1BB-costimulated CART19 cells generated from healthy donors were stimulated with CD3/CD28 beads at a 1:3 ratio for 6 days. CART cells were maintained at 1 x 106/mL throughout the culture and supplemented with IgG isotype control, GM-CSF neutralizing antibody, or GM-CSFRα blockade at 10 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL, or 100 μg/mL. On day 6, cells were debeaded and rested for 2 days. Then, CART cells were cocultured with NALM6, a CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, at a ratio of 1:1 for 3 days. The cocultures were supplemented with the same doses of antibodies listed above. Antigen-specific proliferation of CART cells was measured by flow cytometry. Our data suggested that CART19 proliferated is not impacted by GM-CSF neutralization but is inhibited by GM-CSFRα blockade (IgG isotype vs 10 μg/mL GM-CSFRα blockade, p<0.0001; IgG isotype vs 20 μg/mL GM-CSFRα blockade, p<0.0001; IgG isotype vs 100 μg/mL GM-CSFRα blockade, p=0.009). CART cells were assessed in a cytotoxicity assay with NALM6 luciferase+ cells as well, which did not show significant impacts from GM-CSF neutralization or GM-CSFRα blockade.
 To evaluate the impacts of GM-CSF neutralization and GM-CSFRα blockade in a mouse model, we engrafted NSG mice with 1 million NALM6 luciferase+ cells intravenously. Mice were then treated with 1.4 million CART19 plus 10 mg/kg IgG isotype control, GM-CSF neutralizing antibody, or GM-CSFRα blockade intraperitoneally. GM-CSFRα blockade drastically suppressed antitumor activities of CART (CART19+GM-CSFRα blockade vs CART19+IgG isotype control, p<0.0001; CART19+GM-CSFRα blockade vs CART19+GM-CSF neutralizing antibody, p<0.0001; CART19+ GM-CSFRα blockade vs untransduced T cell, n.s.). Serum cytokines were analyzed 2 days after CART treatment, showing that mice with GM-CSFRα blockade had significantly lower levels of human IFNγ (p=0.0189) and IL-2 (p=0.0121) compared to IgG isotype control group, while GM-CSF neutralization did not show significant impacts. Mice treated with CART plus IgG isotype control or GM-CSF neutralizing antibody showed prolonged survival compared to mice treated with GM-CSFRα blockade or untransduced T cells (p=0.0285).
 To unravel the mechanisms behind functional differences between GM-CSFRα blockade and GM-CSF neutralization, CART cells (n = 3 biological replicates) were cocultured with NALM6 at a 1:1 ratio supplemented with 10 μg/mL GM-CSF neutralizing antibody, GM-CSFRα blockade, or IgG isotype control overnight, followed by T cell isolation, bulk RNA isolation, and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. Our RNAseq data indicated significant upregulation (Log2FC>0.5, padj. <0.05) of T cell exhaustion- and dysfunction-associated genes (RGS16, PDCD1, CTLA4, NR4A3, CD101, LAG3) as well as negative regulators of T cell functions (G0S2, PIK3IP1, LGALS3) in the GM-CSFRα blockade group compared to GM-CSF neutralizing antibody or IgG isotype control groups. T cell activation-associated pathways were enriched in the GM-CSFRα blockade group.
 Overall, our data show that GM-CSFRα blockade impacts CART functions differently from GM-CSF neutralization. Specifically, GM-CSFRα blockade inhibits CART proliferation in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo. Interestingly, GM-CSFRα blockade leads to enrichment of T cell exhaustion- and dysfunction-associated genes in CART19, which is worth further investigation. These findings may be applicable to other cytokine receptors upregulated on activated CART cells.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is notoriously devoid of lymphocytes driven in part by a paucity of lymphocyte trafficking factors necessary to prompt their recruitment, infiltration, and activation. We have developed a novel recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy strategy that enables focal and stable reconstitution of the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) with C-X-C motif ligand 9 (CXCL9), a powerful call-and-receive chemokine for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). By increasing lymphocyte recruitment in GBM, we HYPOTHESIZE that these tumors will be more responsive to immunotherapy.



 3D fluorescence microscopy was used to characterize the distribution, tropism, and durability of AAV6 transgene expression in preclinical GBM. Flow cytometry and 3D fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify T cell infiltration and visualize their biodistribution in preclinical GBM treated with AAV-CXCL9 in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to characterize intratumor lymphocyte subsets following treatment. Survival studies with and without lymphocyte depletion were done to evaluate immunogenic responsiveness of therapy.



 Focal delivery of CXCL9 with AAV6 results in stable transduction of peri-tumoral astrocytes. When combined with anti-PD-1 ICB, lymphocyte infiltration was improved, with cells found disseminated across the tumor stroma and within the tumor parenchyma. CXCR3, the chemokine receptor for CXCL9, was expressed across lymphocyte subsets and NKT cells, validating treatment selectivity of AAV6-CXCL9 for lymphocytes. Combination treatment considerably improved overall survival in two distinct GBM models, with durable responses dependent on CD8 T-lymphocyte infiltration.



 By manipulating local chemokine directional guidance, AAV-CXCL9 increases tumor infiltration by CD8-postive cytotoxic lymphocytes, sensitizing GBM to anti-PD-1 ICB. These effects are accompanied by immunologic signatures evocative of an inflamed and responsive TME. These findings support targeted AAV gene therapy as a promising adjuvant strategy for reconditioning GBM immunogenicity given its excellent safety profile, TME-tropism, modularity, and off-the-shelf capability.

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized immune cells that play a crucial role in presenting antigens and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to combat tumors. The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) can bind to its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This interaction suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Radiation therapy can increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, and detailed studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. As many patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy-either through lack of response or cancer recurrence-there is a critical need to maximize synergistic effects by selecting combination treatments that offer improved therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects. In the present study, immature DCs (iDCs) were introduced directly into irradiated tumor sites (referred as IR/iDCs), and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) were administered intraperitoneally. We confirmed the antitumor effect of combining IR/iDCs and ICBs by examining tumor growth and mouse survival. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes increased in the IR/iDCs-treated groups. Combining IR/iDCs with an anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a significant reduction in distant tumor growth and improved mouse survival rates compared with IR/iDCs alone or IR/iDCs + anti-PD-1 antibody. These findings suggest that integrating radiotherapy, DC-based immunotherapy, and ICB, specifically targeting PD-L1, may be an effective cancer treatment strategy.">

 Introduction
 CD24 is a “don't eat me” signal that inhibits macrophage phagocytosis and has emerged as a potential immunotherapy target due to expression on solid tumors and hematologic malignancies and its proposed role in promoting immune evasion. CD24-CAR T cells have been described, however widespread expression of CD24 on healthy tissues introduces therapeutic challenges such as on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Little is known about the molecular drivers of CAR T cell off-tumor toxicity. In this study, we evaluated determinants of efficacy and toxicity of CD24-CAR T cells by modulating signal transduction via CD3ζ and costimulatory signals.
 Methods
 To assess toxicity in a syngeneic mouse model, we generated mouse-specific CD24-CAR T cells incorporating a CD28 costimulatory domain and a CD3ζ activation domain. To compare efficacy and toxicity of CAR designs with varying strengths of signal 1 and signal 2, we additionally constructed and evaluated CD24-CARs with inactivation of immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) 2 and 3 (1XX), CD24-CARs with CD28 costimulatory domain mutations, and those lacking costimulation (first generation). Quantitative live cell microscopy was performed to measure T cell proliferation, NFkB activation, and target lysis. We evaluated CD24-CAR T cells in syngeneic mouse models of pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BM185), B cell lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) following sublethal irradiation as pre-conditioning. We evaluated mice for tumor clearance by bioluminescence imaging, and toxicity via weight assessments, serum cytokine quantification, and multiparameter flow cytometry of bone marrow.
 Results
 CD28-costimulated CD24-CAR T cells (CD24.28z) showed modest anti-tumor activity against BM185 in vivo, without evidence of toxicity. To boost T cell activity and restrict differentiation and exhaustion, we modulated signal 1 by mutating ITAMs. Treatment with CD24.28.1XX T cells improved anti-tumor activity, but mice required euthanasia due to moribund state and weight loss, associated with elevation in serum cytokines IL-6, IFNg, and MCP-1 suggesting cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and pulmonary parenchymal CAR T cell infiltration causing pneumocyte apoptosis and vasculitis. CD24.28.1XX T cells were similarly active and toxic in lymphoma and AML models. CRS and toxicity were fully abrogated in CD24-deficient recipient mice, which cleared leukemia and demonstrated long-term survival after CD24.28.1XX T cell infusion. In vitro, CD24.28.1XX T cells exhibited increased antigen-dependent proliferation and IFNg production relative to CD24.28z. First generation 1XX CD24-CAR T cells did not cause early lethal toxicity, but enabled late leukemia outgrowth, suggesting the requirement of CD28 costimulation for efficacy and toxicity. Mutation of CD28 YMNM and PRRP, but not PYAP, motifs attenuated in vivo toxicity of CD24.28.1XX T cells, which correlated with decreased in vitro NFkB activation. Overexpression of a degradation-resistant IkBalpha canonical NFkB pathway inhibitor (NFkBIAm) attenuated cytokine production in vitro and in vivo, inhibited pulmonary toxicity, and eliminated early toxicity, but also impeded tumor clearance. Transcriptomic analysis identified that compared with CD24.28.1XX T cells, both CD24.28z and CD24.28.1XX.NFKBIAm T cells exhibited reduced type I/II interferon responses, enhanced CD8 cytotoxic differentiation, and increased exhaustion scores. NFkBIAm additionally downregulated pathways related to metabolism and cell cycle. Co-expression of PD-1-OX40 and Fas-4-1BB switch receptors with CD24.28.1XX.NFkBIAm transiently increased NFkB activation, enhancing anti-leukemia activity and prolonging survival of tumor-bearing mice.
 Conclusions
 Our findings demonstrate robust anti-tumor activity of CD24-CAR T cells against multiple hematologic malignancies, but also identified non-relapse mortality from on-target, off-tumor toxicity with prominent CRS and pulmonary pathology, which required CD24 expression on normal tissues. Promoting T cell differentiation and exhaustion via full-strength CD3 zeta signaling and NFkB attenuation mitigated toxicity. Addition of OX40 and 4-1BB costimulation to NFkB-inhibited CD24 CAR T cells enhanced CAR T cell expansion and anti-tumor activity without early lethal toxicity, enabling prolonged survival in a syngeneic mouse model.

 Background: Immune aplastic anemia (AA) is a disease of bone marrow failure (BMF) primarily driven by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, although other cellular pathways have been implicated in the disease. The depletion of macrophages in a murine BMF model ameliorated bone marrow (BM) destruction and alleviated peripheral pancytopenia, suggestive of the importance of macrophages and related cells in the pathogenesis of AA. In the current study, we utilized Pexidartinib (PLX, Selleck Chemicals) to further test the role of macrophages and other related cells in a well-established AA mouse model. PLX is a CSF1R inhibitor that depletes circulating non-classical monocytes and reduces tissue macrophage infiltration.
 Methods: BMF was induced by injection of 5 × 10^6/mouse lymph node cells from C57BL/6 (B6) donors into heterozygous major histocompatibility complex mismatched CByB6F1 recipients pre-irradiated with 5 Gy total body irradiation. BMF mice were either left untreated, treated with PLX at 50 mg/kg three times per week for two weeks, or treated with JAK inhibitor baricitinib (BAR, LC Laboratories) at 25 mg/kg five times per week for two weeks. Both PLX and BAR were administered through oral gavage. Animals were either bled and euthanized at day 14 to measure cellular composition in the peripheral blood and BM, or monitored for survival.
 Results: PLX treatment unexpectedly augmented BMF development in CByB6F1 mice, causing further declines in blood neutrophils (0.06 ± 0.02 vs 0.1 ± 0.02, 109/L, P < .05), red blood cells (4.4 ± 0.4 vs 6.4 ± 0.4, 1012/L, P < .0001), hemoglobin (7.1 ± 0.7 vs 10.1 ± 0.7, g/dL, P < .0001), and platelets (32.4 ± 9.6 vs 73.1 ± 9.6, 109/L, P < .001) when compared to untreated BMF mice which already exhibited significant peripheral blood pancytopenia. The acceleration of blood pancytopenia by PLX was accompanied by increased CD4+ (16.1 ± 1.0 vs 12.1 ± 1.0, %, P < .001) and a trend towards increased CD8+ (55.1 ± 2.3 vs 50.8 ± 2.3, %, P = .07) proportions, as well as increased Fas expression (61.6 ± 4.4 vs 45.4 ± 4.4, %, P < .001) and apoptosis (72.5 ± 4.1 vs 62.6 ± 4.1, %, P < .001) in non-T cell leukocytes. In the BM, PLX treatment caused further decline in total BM cells (87.7 ± 14.8 vs 122.3 ± 14.8, 106, P < .05) relative to BMF mice without treatment, along with decreases in the proportions of CD11b myeloid cells (5.8 ± 4.5 vs 19.4 ± 4.5, %, P < .05) and granulocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC, 3.7 ± 4.3 vs 16.6 ± 4.3, %, P < .05). Survival was significantly worse in the PLX-treated mice (P < .05).
 Additional experimentation was performed to better characterize the macrophage and MDSC populations. While there was no change in the overall number of macrophages, the PLX treatment group demonstrated a polarization towards the pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophage in comparison to the BM of untreated BMF mice (8.0 ± 1.0 vs 5.0 ± 1.0, %, P < .05). Because BAR attenuated BMF mice efficiently, we wanted to compare different effects on this cell component between BAR and PLX in order to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for worsening the disease by PLX. Consistent with previously presented data, baricitinib treatment ameliorated BMF in CByB6F1 mice. In comparison to the BAR-treated population the overall macrophage proportion in the BM of PLX-treated mice was greater (13.1 ± 1.7 vs 4.0 ± 1.6, %, P < .0001), notably the M1-type macrophage (8.0 ± 1.0 vs 0.02 ± 0.9, %, P < .0001). PLX-treated mice exhibited decreased CD11b myeloid cells (2.0 ± 3.6 vs 31.9 ± 3.3, %, P < .0001), G-MDSC (0.02 ± 3.3 vs 24.2 ± 3.0, %, P < .0001), and monocytic-MDSC (0.003 ± 0.3 vs 2.0 ± 0.3, %, P < .0001).
 Conclusions: Inhibition ofCSF1R with PLX augmented murine BMF with increased T cell infiltration and enhanced leukocyte apoptosis, probably due to decreased G-MDSC and CD11b myeloid precursors. This finding is consistent with published results showing that G-MDSC are immunosuppressive and could be used as a potential therapeutic in treating murine BMF. The polarization towards the pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophage in PLX-treated mice supports the idea that this type of macrophage primes cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, whereas polarization towards the anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophage in BAR-treated mice is consistent with suppression of CD8+ T cell infiltration. More work is underway to better characterize the relationship between and function of macrophages and MDSCs in aplastic anemia.

 Whereas the contribution of tumor microenvironment to the profound immune suppression of glioblastoma (GBM) is clear, tumor-cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate resistance to CD8 T cells are less studied. We performed an in vivo CRISPR screen to identify glioma intrinsic kinases that contribute to evasion of tumor cells from CD8 T cells. The screen revealed a DNA damage response gene-checkpoint kinase 2 (Chek2) to be the most important kinase contributing to escape from CD8 T-cell recognition. Genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of Chek2 with blood-brain-barrier permeable drugs that are in the clinical trials, in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, led to survival benefit in preclinical glioma models. Analysis of human GBMs demonstrated that Chek2 expression is inversely associated with antigen presentation and T-cell activation. However, the mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive function of Chek2 in gliomas is unknown. Here, we identified that glioma tumor cell intrinsic Chek2 interacts with Y-Box Binding Protein 1 and 3 (Ybx1&3) in ex vivo gliomas using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Independently, YBX3 was also identified as one of the most significantly phosphorylated protein upon Chek2 knockout using phosphoproteomics analysis. The YBX1&3 are DNA/RNA binding proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation of immune-modulatory genes. In silico docking using Alphafold and PIPER tool in Schrodinger revealed that the YBX1 cold-shock domain interacted near the ATP/ADP binding site in CHK2. This interface was also part of the CHK2-CHK2 dimer interface. Consistent with our model, disruption of CHK2 dimerization using prexasertib led to increased colocalization of CHK2-YBX1 in human GBM patient derived xenograft cells. Further, targeting of CHK2-YBX1 interaction with YBX1 inhibitor SU056 reversed the repression of IFNγ response genes in glioma cells. Together this study unveils a kinase independent (non-catalytic) function of CHK2, providing insight into the non-canonical immunosuppressive role of CHK2 in gliomas.">

        <tr id="Aberrant intestinal inflammation plays a critical role in the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), yet the mechanisms controlling tumor development by the myeloid immune compartment are not fully understood. Although altered microRNA expression is observed in CAC, it is also unclear how myeloid-specific microRNAs impact the inflammatory process that underpins the continuum from ulcerative colitis to tumorigenesis. In this study, we report that miR-223 acts to limit myeloid-driven inflammation in the azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of CAC in mice. In this model, miR-223-/y mice present with significantly larger tumors with an enhanced proliferative signature. Immunoprofiling showed that miR-223-/y mice have significantly increased colonic myeloid immune infiltrate (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) following AOM-DSS. This was accompanied by an increased inflammatory chemokine and cytokine signature for monocytes and neutrophils. Bone marrow chimera studies demonstrate that myeloid-expressed miR-223 is responsible for the enhanced tumor proliferation and inflammatory response. RNA sequencing identified several pathways that could be contributing to the development of CAC in miR-223-/y mice, including the IL-6/IL-17a cytokine family and STAT3 signaling. Lastly, neutrophil depletion with an anti-GR1 Ab (Ly6G/Ly6C) during the initial phase of the AOM-DSS model reduced the tumor burden in miR-223-/y mice. Collectively, our data indicate that miR-223 is an important regulator of mucosal inflammation and acts to constrain the progression from ulcerative colitis to CAC by limiting myeloid-associated inflammation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells capable of directly killing target cells while modulating immune effector responses. Despite their multifunctional capacities, a limited understanding of their plasticity and heterogeneity has impeded progress in developing effective NK cell-based cancer therapies. In this study, we investigated NK cell tissue heterogeneity in relation to their phenotype and effector functions against lung tumors. Methods Using hanging drop tumor spheroid and subcutaneously established LL/2 (LLC1) lung tumor models, we examined NK cell receptor diversity and its correlation with tissue-specific cytotoxicity through multiparametric flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and cytotoxicity assays. Results We identified distinct patterns of cell surface receptors expression on tissue-specific NK cells that are crucial for antitumor activity. Linear regression mathematical analyses further revealed significant positive correlations between activation-associated cell surface receptors and cytotoxic capacity in NK cells from tissues such as the liver and bone marrow. Conclusion These findings underscore the differential effector capacities of NK cells from distinct tissues, even prior to exposure to LL/2 tumor cells. This highlights the significance of tissue-specific NK cell heterogeneity and its impact on their antitumor cytotoxicity. Recognizing these distinct tissue-specific receptor expression patterns will be instrumental in developing more efficacious NK cell-based cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Although MDSCs are widely recognized for their immunoinhibitory effects in pathological conditions, their function during HIV infection particularly within the mechanisms underlying incomplete immune recovery remains elusive.We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 30 healthy controls and 62 HIV-1-infected subjects [31 immunological non-responders (INRs) and 31 immunological responders (IRs)] were selected. The proportion of MDSCs was determined in each category of participants. Using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, immune regulatory molecules (including PD-L1, ARG1, iNOS, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO) that are relevant for MDSCs activity were quantified. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the blockade of PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways on MDSCs and their effects on CD4+ T-cells using in vitro functional experiments.PMN-MDSCs are more abundant and are negatively correlated to CD4 counts in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, PMN-MDSCs suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in INRs. Furthermore, correlations were found between PD-L1 expression on PMN-MDSCs and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells. TGF-β expression on PMN-MDSCs was likewise enhanced in INRs. Importantly, inhibiting both PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways had a synergistic impact on restoring CD4+ T-cell activity in vitro.PMN-MDSCs expansion inhibits CD4+ T-cell responses. We suggest that targeting PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways together may significantly improve immune recovery in INRs.">

 Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent tumor in which epigenetic alterations and BCL2 translocations foster malignant transformation by reprogramming germinal center (GC)/memory B cell immune dynamics and remodeling the tumor microenvironment (TME). Lenalidomide and other cereblon (CRBN)-targeting agents, such as the novel CELMoD, golcadomide, have shown clinical efficacy in B cell neoplasms such as FL or DLBCL. However, because these molecules lack activity in mouse models, unraveling the biological mechanisms by which CELMoDs exert their activity in complex in vivo systems, such as the native GC B cell immune response or relevant preclinical mouse models, has been limited. Here we investigated the in vivo mechanism of action of golcadomide during the normal and pathological GC B cell immune response and tested whether early intervention with immunomodulatory agents may represent a promising therapeutic avenue against FL progression.
 To study the in vivo effect of golcadomide during a native immune response, we developed a novel mouse model (huCRBN) by inserting the human CRBN gene upstream and in frame of the mouse Crbn gene, allowing substrate recruitment and degradation not possible in a wild-type mouse. We immunized huCRBN animals to induce GC formation and treated the mice by gavage every other day with golcadomide (3mg/kg) or vehicle for 1, 2, 3 weeks and sacrificed 48h after treatment cessation. We analyzed Ikaros and Aiolos protein levels in T and B cell subsets by flow cytometry at 6, 24h after treatment. To evaluate the therapeutic activity of golcadomide in FL in vivo, we crossed our previously characterized Kmt2d/BCL2 (KB) preclinical FL model (Brisou et al, ASH 2023) with the huCRBN mouse (KBC). We then generated chimeric mice in which hematopoietic progenitor cells from CD19Cre+ Kmt2df/+huCRBN+ mice were used as donor cells for retroviral transduction with the huBCL2-Cd2Tag vector. The engineered progenitor cells were then re-transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated immunocompetent WT (n=15) or huCRBN recipients (n=29). KBC animals at the pretumoral stages (8 months post-transplant) were randomized to receive golcadomide or vehicle alone. Spectral flow cytometry was conducted on immune subsets in spleen/lymph nodes and integrative single cell RNAseq and immune repertoire analysis was done on whole spleen in selected huCRBN and KBC animals.During the normal GC immune response, we showed that in the huCRBN mice treated with golcadomide, all splenic B and T cell subsets exhibit a rapid degradation of IKZF1 and, to a lesser extent, IKZF3 substrates in 6 hours, which is not seen in wild-type mice, confirming the relevance of the huCRBN model for evaluating CELMoD activity. Golcadomide treatment acts on B cells in all lymphoid tissues with a progressive decrease of naive and memory subsets. We observed a global increase and activation of T cells with T regulatory cells reaching 25% of the CD4 pool and a phenotypic shift to CD4/CD8 central memory and effector cells consistent with previous observations with lenalidomide. We next evaluated the efficacy of golcadomide and impact on mutant B and immune T cells in the pretumoral KBC model. As previously reported, single-cell expression profiles of the untreated KBC-mutant B cells manifested mainly as a continuum of states from proliferating GC-like to quiescent mem-like phenotypes confirming progression to FL pretumoral stages. KBC mice receiving golcadomide presented with decreased memory-like subsets whereas the GC/GC-Mem intermediates persisted and expanded, suggesting their resistance to golcadomide alone and a capacity to form a pool of residual cells after therapy. Finally, golcadomide induced a significant increase in Tregs and CD4/CD8+ towards an activated phenotype, helping to restore immune surveillance. Spatial analysis to map cellular neighborhoods of malignant B cells, immune cells on treatment is ongoing. In addition, the preclinical evaluation of a combination therapy of golcadomide with mouse anti-Cd20 immunotherapy modeling the impact of a chemo-free regimen in FL will be reported.Our original huCRBN and KBC mouse models allow the first in vivo study to unravel the efficacy and mechanism of action of CELMoDs during native immune response and early FL progression. We expect that this study will allow us to propose novel rational hypotheses for combination therapies with golcadomide to intercept FL.

 Introduction:
 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal malignancy characterized by overlapping myeloid dysplasia and proliferation with persisting monocytosis. Characteristic repartitioning of classical monocytes (CD14+/CD16-/low) is now a supporting diagnostic criterion (WHO5), though its mechanistic basis remains unknown. While monocytes are the cardinal malignant cell type in CMML, as a stem cell neoplasm the disease clone comprises most lineages and differentiation stages. Granulocytes are the most abundant circulating blood cells and play key roles in immune response via cytokine and growth factor secretion. They too are typically expanded, dysfunctional and linked to poor prognosis in CMML; their pathogenic contribution however remains understudied. We hypothesized that granulocytes play a critical role in CMML maintenance and progression.
 Methods:
 We isolated granulocytes via negative selection from healthy (n=19) and CMML (n=26) peripheral blood for immunophenotype, transcriptome and functional analyses. Phagocytic capacity was determined using zymosal uptake assays. Resistin plasma levels were determined by ELISA. Resistin's role in CMML biology was studied by RNA-seq, flow cytometry and a series of cell viability, monocyte differentiation and T cell profiling assays. Clinical correlates, including survival analyses, were determined from linked patient metadata.
 Results:
 Compared with healthy age-matched controls, CMML granulocytes exhibited defective maturation with reduced granularity, decreased mature CD11b+/CD16+ fraction and higher CD66 expression. Immature status was independent of clinical features and mutation profile. CMML granulocytes were also defective in phagocytic capacity compared to healthy controls. RNA-seq clearly distinguished between granulocytes from healthy (n=14) and CMML (n=14) patients. Upregulated genes in CMML are involved in pathways linked to proliferation and Myc activity, with defensins and neutrophil elastase (ELANE) among the top 20 upregulated genes. Notably, RETN, which encodes the cysteine-rich peptide hormone and inflammatory mediator resistin, was upregulated 100-fold in CMML granulocytes; but not differentially expressed in CMML bulk MNCs, sorted monocytes, or stem cells compared to healthy counterparts. Accordingly, resistin protein levels were 10-fold higher in plasma from CMML patients compared with age-matched controls; levels positively correlated with granulocyte RETN RNA expression, validating CMML granulocytes as the primary source of raised resistin levels. Patients with high secreted resistin levels also displayed worse overall survival.
 Remarkably, exposure of healthy monocytes to exogenous recombinant resistin induced classical monocyte repartition, recapitulating the pattern seen in CMML. This phenotype was confirmed to be mediated via resistin's interaction with TLR4. Healthy monocyte differentiation to macrophages was also suppressed in the presence of recombinant resistin. We next performed RNA-seq on resistin- and LPS-treated healthy monocytes, revealing gene expression patterns consistent with resistin-induced maintenance of a classical monocyte state. Genes induced by resistin are involved in immune suppression and myeloid-derived suppressor phenotype. We then overlapped these with genes differentially expressed in CMML monocytes, revealing candidate in vivo targets of resistin. These included SEMA4A, SDC2, SPP1 and VIM: genes involved in M2 polarization and immune suppression. We confirmed SEMA4A induction at the protein level upon resistin treatment, and observed higher SEMA4A levels linked to poor prognosis and an immune suppressive cellular phenotype. Consistent with known roles for SEMA4A in Treg expansion and Th2/Th1 ratio skewing, CMML patients displayed higher T-regs and Th2/Th1 ratio compared with healthy controls, apparently corresponding with associated resistin levels.
 Conclusions:
 We demonstrate that CMML granulocytes are functionally immature and produce high levels of resistin, directly contributing to the classical monocytosis phenotype. High resistin plasma levels correlate with expanded Tregs and induce immune suppressive features in CMML monocytes via downstream mediators including SEMA4A. Thus, approaches targeting resistin or blocking the resistin-TLR4 interaction may have therapeutic value in CMML.

 Background: Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a highly aggressive malignancy pathologically associated with Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) infection. Previous studies have found that EBV is the main contributor to shaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment of NKTCL. However, the mechanisms and functional consequences of EBV-infected tumor cells in modulating T cell immune responses remain unclear.
 Methods: In this study, we collected an extensive dataset comprising scRNAseq data from 10 treatment-naïve NKTCL patients (GSE203663) and bulk RNAseq data from 278 patients including 128 from OEP000498, 84 from GSE160119 and 66 from GSE90597. Seurat was employed to identify T cells and their subtypes within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we explored the ligand-receptor pairs between T cell subtypes and NK cells by using CellChat. Additionally, we employed the corrplot R package to evaluate the correlation of candidate genes expression.
 Results: We first delineate the transcriptional profiles of both normal and malignant NK cells in NKTCL patients, which were categorized into EBV-high and EBV-low based on the transcription level of EBV-encoded genes in tumors. We found that MHC-II-related molecules, including HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, HLA-DQA, HLA-DQB, HLA-DPA, HLA-DPB, etc., were remarkably expressed in EBV-high malignant NK cells, significantly differing from normal and EBV-low malignant NK cells (log2FC>1, FDR<0.01). Interestingly, MHC-I-related molecules, such as HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-E, were substantially overexpressed in EBV-high normal NK cells. Considering the pivotal roles of EBV and MHC molecules in shaping the immune microenvironment, particularly T cell immunity, we next analyzed CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. A total of 9087 CD8+ T cells were grouped into eight clusters: C1_NAIVE (naïve T cells), C2_CM (central memory T cells), C3_MAIT, C4_EM (effector memory T cells), C5_EFF (effector T cells), C7_XCL(exhausted T cells with high XCL-1), C8_EX (exhausted T cells), and C9_PROLIFE. We observed an enrichment of exhausted CD8+ T cells (25.03%), including 15.22% in C8_EX and 9.81% in C7_XCL, in EBV-high tumors versus EBV-low tumors (13.54%). We further evaluated the expression of inhibitory molecules in tumor-infiltrating T cells, and the results revealed that TOX, HAVCR2, PDCD1, CTLA4, TIGIT and LAG3 were upregulated in CD8+ T cells from EBV-high tumors. Among these, LAG3 was the most markedly upregulated and expressed at a higher proportion, with expression levels reaching 54.02% in CD8+ T cells from EBV-high tumors compared to 42.16% in EBV-low tumors. Previous studies reported that MHC-II is the primary ligand that interacted with LAG3 on T cells. Thus, we conducted ligand-receptor interactions analysis between NK cells and CD8+ T cells in NKTCL. We observed the strongest interactions between LAG3 on CD8+ T cells and MHC-II molecules on EBV-high malignant NK cells, including HLA-DPA1, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRA, compared with normal NK cells and EBV-low malignant NK cells. Besides, the interactions between LAG3 and MHC-II molecules were markedly stronger than that between LAG3 and LGALS3. We further confirmed the interactions in the bulk RNAseq dataset by assessing the correlation between LAG3 and MHC-II molecules, as well as EBV transcription levels. We observed significant positive correlations between LAG3 and HLA-DPA1/DQB1(LAG3- HLA-DPA1: R=0.32, P=0.001; LAG3-HLA-DQB1: R=0.63, P<0.001), as well as between LAG3 and EBV (R=0.44, P<0.001). The above results suggested that NKTCL tumor cell-specific upregulated MHC-II molecules strongly interacted with LAG3 on CD8+ T cells, contributing to sustaining T cell exhaustion.
 Conclusions: The study revealed that MHC-II molecules were significantly upregulated in EBV-high NKTCL tumor cells, strongly interacting with LAG3, which was overexpressed on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. The interactions between LAG3 and MHC-II molecules contributed to T cell exhaustion in NKTCL. Consequently, LAG3 could serve as a promising therapeutic target for NKTCL.

 Patients suffering from AML still lack significant benefits from immunotherapeutic approaches (Pfister et al., 2022, Subklewe et al., 2023). One reason for this is an incomplete understanding of the AML microenvironment (ME), particularly the role of the innate immune compartment. Ample evidence in solid tumors shows that innate immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages, neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, contribute to a suppressive ME, while relatively little is known about the innate immunity in AML (Perzolli et al., 2024). In this project, we focus on the characterization of macrophages and their respective cellular interaction with leukemic and non-leukemic cells in the pediatric AML ME.
 In two independent pediatric AML cohorts (Maxima, n=140 and TARGET, n=159, bulk bone marrow RNA-sequencing data), we observed a higher abundance of anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages compared to pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages. Additionally, we noted that AML patients with fusion genes, in particular KMT2A-rearrangements (KMT2Ar), CBFB::MYH11 and NUP98::NSD1, had a higher abundance of M2-like macrophages compared to those with normal karyotypes with or without mutations in known leukemic regulators such as NPM1 and CEBPA. Furthermore, pediatric AML patients showed a higher amount of M2-like macrophages than healthy donors (n=7). By flow cytometry, we confirmed M2/M1 ratios >1 in five primary AML patients (KMT2A::MLLT10, KMT2A::MLLT9, NUP98::TOP1, RUNX1::RUNX1T1 and CBFB::MYH11) and M2/M1 ratios <1 in three healthy donors.
 RUNX1::RUNX1T1 and KMT2Ar AML cell lines, as well as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells, can alter the phenotype of M1-like macrophages generated from the monocytic cell line THP-1, skewing them towards an M2-like phenotype. We, therefore, investigated the interaction between macrophages and AML blasts using primary and PDX cells. We differentiated monocytes from healthy donors into five different macrophage subtypes (M0, M1, M2a, M2c, M2d) and co-cultured them with PDX or primary AML cells. These co-culture experiments revealed that primary M2-like macrophages (M2a and/or M2c) support RUNX1::RUNX1T1 and KMT2Ar AML cell proliferation, while M1-like macrophages transiently inhibited leukemic proliferation. Notably, this inhibitory effect disappeared after six days of co-culture. Flow cytometry showed reduced surface expression of the M1 markers CD80 and HLA-DR and an increase of the M2 markers CD206 and CD163. Gene expression analysis demonstrated reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes (IL1α, ILβ, IL6, CXCL9) and increased expression of anti-inflammatory and angiogenic genes (ARG2, TGFB2, VEGFA, VEGFC). We next investigated whether these transcriptional changes lead to functional alterations. Using a bioluminescence T cell activation assay, we found that M1-like macrophages lose their ability to activate T cells when co-cultured with AML blasts. Additionally, flow cytometry showed that M1-like macrophages inhibit T cell proliferation when co-cultured with AML blasts, behaving similarly to M2-like macrophages. These data suggest that AML blasts reeducate human-monocyte derived M1-like macrophages to a pro-tumoral and immunosuppressive phenotype.
 Finally, we examined whether the interaction between primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and AML blasts depends on cell-cell contact. Transwell experiments revealed that AML blasts require direct contact with macrophages to influence their phenotypes and functions. In the transwell setting, M1-like macrophages retained their ability to suppress AML cell proliferation and did not show increased expression of M2 surface markers (CD206 and CD163), anti-inflammatory (ARG2 and TGFB2) or angiogenic genes (VEGFA and VEGFC). Further studies are underway to elucidate the specific nature of the interactions between macrophages and AML blasts, including the characterization of ligand-receptor interactions between the two populations and the identification of perturbed molecular mechanisms.
 Overall, our data suggest that AML blasts reorganize the microenvironment by re-educating pro-inflammatory macrophages into an anti-inflammatory state through direct contact. We predict that an understanding of the interaction between AML blasts and BM macrophages will identify novel targets for reversing the immunosuppressive ME in pediatric AML.

 A key component that has limited the efficacy of immunotherapy in glioblastoma (GBM) is the significant infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Our previous work characterized myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) unique to GBM that drive tumor growth and immune suppression. Transcriptomic and flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the most induced programs in these MDSCs are dominated by metabolic and mTOR pathways. Therefore, we aimed to understand the role of metabolic reprogramming in MDSC differentiation and immunosuppressive function. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identified overexpression of enzymes and transporters involved in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, notably branched chain aminotransferase 1 (BCAT1), the first enzyme in the metabolic pathway. Intriguingly, this was only found in specific populations of early and monocytic MDSCs (E-MDSCs, M-MDSCs), and not polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs). Using established MDSC modeling systems, we found that M-MDSC differentiation and T cell suppressive function are dependent on BCAAs and can be hindered by pharmacological inhibition of BCAT1 activity or genetic knockout of BCAT1. We also establish that the influence of BCAA on M-MDSC function is specifically reliant on the BCAT1-mediated step of BCAA metabolism. To determine the underlying mechanism driving BCAT1’s impact on M-MDSC function, we evaluated the activity of signaling pathways known to be critical to M-MDSCs including the mTORC1 pathway. We found that the impact of BCAA and BCAT1 activity on M-MDSC function is abrogated by inhibition of mTORC1 pathway with reduction in M-MDSC differentiation and activity. Consistent with our single cell RNA sequencing analysis, modulation of BCAA levels and BCAT1 activity had no impact on PMN-MDSCs. Our results underscore the critical role of BCAT1 in preferentially modulating M-MDSC activity through mTORC1 signaling. Our finding paves the way for discovery of a targetable therapeutic approach to harness immunometabolism in myeloid cells to develop novel immune therapies.">

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy represents a pivotal treatment modality in clinical practice. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), a key subset of B lymphocytes, hold promise in the management of autoimmune diseases, cancer and transplantation immunity. The expansion of Bregs for cell therapy is a promising strategy to alleviate inflammation and promote immune tolerance. Achieving immune tolerance relies on balance between regulatory and effector cells. One primary objective of cellular therapy is to shift this balance towards Bregs, fostering a more tolerant immune microenvironment. The adoptive transfer of Bregs not only increases their quantity but also modulates the number and function of other immune cells. Maximizing in vitro expansion of Bregs and enhancing their regulatory functions are key focuses in transplant immunology. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the in vitro expansion of IL-10-secreting B cells (B10) remain inadequately understood. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the signaling pathways involved in B10 activation and expansion, as well as to highlight the techniques for in vitro amplification and development of adoptive B10 therapy in transplantation, which aims to advance the field of cellular therapy targeting Bregs.">

        <tr id="Considering the general view that unconventional immune effectors play a major role in antitumor immunity, we recently postulated that the distinct new innate CD8 T-cell pool (co-expressing the transcription factor Eomesodermin and innate markers such as KIR/NKG2A) may counteract tumor cells, and thereby be potential target for cancer therapy. Here, to test this assumption, we used successfully targeted anti-leukemic therapy discontinuation (TFR) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Numerical and functional status of innate CD8 T-cells, iNKT cells and γδ T-cells, in comparison with NK cells, was compared longitudinally between non-relapsed patients (i.e., with > 12 months TFR) and relapsed patients (i.e., who experienced molecular recurrence during the first 12 months after TKI cessation) in a prospective pilot cohort (n=32), starting from treatment discontinuation (D0). Perforin, a key cytotoxic immune player, was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of both innate CD8 T-cell and NK-cell subsets in non-relapsed patients, compared with relapsed patients at D0. In parallel, we assessed the expression of PD-1, an exhaustion marker used as target in cancer therapy. For all T-cell subsets, surface-expression level of PD-1 decreased in non-relapsed patients compared with relapsed patients at D0. This was particularly the case when considering iNKT cells for which surface-expression level of PD-1 even decreased relative to healthy control subjects. Lastly, we found a negative correlation between the proportion of innate CD8 T-cells expressing PD-1 and those expressing perforin in non-relapsed patients at D0. The fact that this was not the case in conventional CD8 T-cells is compatible with a reprogrammed effector profile preferentially targeting innate CD8 T-cells in non-relapsed patients. All in all, our results highlight NK cells and innate CD8 T-cells harboring cytotoxic content, as well as global downregulation of PD-1-expression on effector T-cells, as potential predictive functional signatures for successful TFR in CML. Considering innate CD8 T-cells, further investigations are needed to determine whether their possible contributory role in cancer surveillance in CML could be extended to other cancers, and also whether their targeting by immune cheek-point inhibitors could enhance their anti-tumoral functions.">

 Introduction: Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many cancer types, yet approved agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown inconsistent efficacy against blood cancers. There are inherent limitations to targeting conventional peptide-specific T cells as they produce variable, patient-specific responses dependent on diverse HLA molecules. In contrast, innate T cells like the highly abundant mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell in humans, recognize conserved non-peptide antigens presented by an evolutionarily conserved oligomorphic MHC class I-related protein (MR1). Recent studies have identified self-reactive MR1-restricted T cells with broad targeting against cancers, providing the rationale to study their application in donor-unrestricted, off-the-shelf immunotherapy; however, the frequency and phenotype of tumor-reactive MAIT cells in cancer patients and the self-antigens responsible for their induction remain unknown. We hypothesize that distinct MAIT cell subpopulations exercise anti-tumor helper/regulatory and cytotoxic functions that synergize to control malignant proliferation.
 Methods: We enrolled 30 subjects with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancy (lymphoid, n=25; myeloid, n=5) and collected longitudinal biospecimens (blood, bone marrow, and/or tissue) over the course of treatment. Healthy donors were also recruited as controls (n=26). MAIT cell abundance (CD161+/TCRVa7.2+ of CD3+ cells), surface activation receptors (CD69, CD25, PD1), and intracellular effector molecules/transcription factors (GZB, IFNγ, FOXP3) were measured by spectral flow cytometry. We conducted in vitro stimulation assays to evaluate the activity of CD4- or CD8-expressing MAIT cell subpopulations, including responses to purified MR1 ligands derived from riboflavin (5-OP-RU) and folic acid (6-FP) biosynthesis pathways.
 Results: We found that the peripheral blood frequency of CD8+ MAIT cells were significantly decreased in patients with myeloid (31%±25% of total MAIT; p=0.002) or lymphoid (56%±27%; p=0.02) malignancy compared to healthy donors (81±9%), while the frequency of CD4+ MAIT cells was unchanged. CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) MAIT cells were significantly decreased in myeloid leukemia relative to healthy donors (2±2% vs 10±5%; p=0.02) but unchanged in lymphoid cancer. There was also a higher baseline of CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) MAIT cells in lymphoid cancer compared to controls (14±27% vs 2±1%; p=0.04). These DP MAIT cells exhibited high levels of baseline activation and did not expand in culture following stimulation with purified MR1 ligands. In donors responding to treatment, there was a progressive re-expansion of the CD8+ subset. Further, both myeloid and lymphoid cancers had more robust MR1 ligand-inducible MR1 expression on B cells relative to healthy donors with similar trends in monocytes, T cells and natural killer cells, suggesting that multiple immune lineages may act as antigen presenting cells.
 Conclusions: Our study found significant alterations in MAIT cell CD4- and CD8-expressing subpopulations in patients with hematologic malignancies relative to healthy donors with normalization of their distribution during treatment. This supports our ongoing work to understand the roles of these distinct subsets in anti-tumor immunity through application of single cell genomics technologies in study volunteers and direct MR1 ligand capture from primary cancer cells using human platform MR1 baculoviral expression systems. Defining conserved MR1 ligands in these blood cancers and the MAIT cell subsets that they induce will inform transformative approaches to MR1-directed cancer immunotherapy.

 Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor, exerts profound local and systemic immunosuppressive effects through a variety of mechanisms. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly appreciated as critical mediators of these effects. In surveying the tumor-immune microenvironment in samples of ultrasonic aspirate collected during surgical resection of GBM (n=13), we identified several key immunomodulatory markers expressed across a range of myeloid cell populations. Particularly, we found TIGIT, classically understood as a T cell inhibitory protein, expressed across a range of myeloid cell populations in patient samples, including in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs, 46.84±16.78% of total monocytic MDSCs). Using EVs collected from patient-derived cell lines, we were able to recapitulate these effects upon co-culture with monocytes derived from the peripheral blood of healthy donors (n=7). Furthermore, Induced MDSCs significantly inhibit T cells proliferation (70.97±8.454%, compared to control 19.4±5.71; p<0.03), concomitant with a surge in Th2 immune responses via TIGIT/CD155 axis. This effect was reversed after TIGIT silencing, indicating a TIGIT-dependent immune suppression in the GBM microenvironment. Our study indicates EV-induced TIGIT upregulation in myeloid cells as a crucial immunosuppressive mechanism in glioblastoma, with potential therapeutic applications.">

 Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with systemic effects and currently has no cure due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. To gain better insights into the immune response associated with psoriasis, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing and parallel single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) profiling on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 11 psoriasis patients and 8 healthy controls. Additionally, we analysed two pairs of skin samples from the psoriasis cohort and performed spatial transcriptomics on two other pairs of skin samples. Our study identified specific immune signatures in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets both in blood and skin and highlighted characteristics of the immune repertoire in psoriasis. Notably, we found an increased proportion of circulating CD14+ monocytes. Furthermore, circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells in psoriasis patients exhibited heightened expression of genes associated with skin-homing and pro-inflammatory responses. Circulating T cells in these patients showed decreased expression of activation markers. In psoriatic lesions, we observed that resting CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells displayed a gene expression profile similar to that of activated CD8+ TRM cells, though they had lower expression levels of cytotoxicity-related genes. Both resting and activated CD8+ TRM cells in psoriatic lesions showed enhanced interaction strength in terms of signal transmission and reception compared with non-lesions. Activated CD8+ TRM cells were densely infiltrated in the dermis of skin lesions, while resting CD8+ TRM cells were located deeper in the dermis of non-lesion areas. TCR clones that were highly expanded in skin lesions were predominantly CD8+ TRM cells. Distinct TCR clusters showed different gene expression signatures, with one CD8+ TRM cluster expressing IFNγ and another expressing IL-17. These findings provide a valuable resource for further investigation into the pathogenesis of psoriasis by offering insights into the immune cell dynamics within both circulation and local skin environments.">

        <tr id="Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common type of ovarian cancer with a low rate of response to immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Here, we report that nucleus accumbens-associated protein 1 (NAC1), a putative driver of EOC, has a critical role in immune evasion. We showed in murine ovarian cancer models that depleting or inhibiting tumoral NAC1 reduced the recruitment and immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), led to significant increases of cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and promoted antitumor immunity and suppressed tumor progression. We further showed that tumoral NAC1 directly enhanced the transcription of CXCL16, by binding to CXCR6, thereby promoting MDSC recruitment to the tumor. Moreover, lipid C20:1T produced by NAC1-expressing tumor cells fueled oxidative metabolism of MDSCs and promoted their immune-suppressive function. We also showed that NIC3, a small molecule inhibitor of NAC1, was able to sensitize mice-bearing NAC1-expressing ovarian tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study reveals a critical role for NAC1 in controlling tumor infiltration of MDSCs and in modulating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Thus, targeting of NAC1 may be exploited to sensitize ovarian cancer to immunotherapy.">

 Background: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is an effective treatment for B-cell malignancies and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, due to the use of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and the infusion of CAR T-cells, the immune-cell profile and immune reconstitution of patients will be affected. Current research on immune recovery mainly focuses on T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. The dynamics of natural killer (NK) cells, which are important anti-virus and anti-tumor cells, after CAR T-cell therapy remain unclear.
 Aim and Methods: The study aimed to track the dynamic changes in NK-cell recovery after CD19 CAR T-cell treatment. Samples were collected from 52 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus at pre-lymphodepletion (pre-LD) and during the first year after CAR T-cell therapy (NCT04008251 and NCT05765006), as well as from 10 healthy volunteers. Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed to longitudinally monitor the dynamics of the NK-cell profile.
 Results: NK-cell number reached the nadir at day 0 and returned to normal reference at about 1 month after CAR-T cell infusion, and the growth of PB-NK cells was synchronized with BM-NK cells. The imbalance of maturation subpopulations of NK cells appeared at pre-LD and was most unbalanced at day 7, with a higher proportion of CD56dimCD16- and a lower proportion of CD56dimCD16+.
 For receptors, expressions of CD16 and NKG2D were impaired at baseline and after LD and recovered to normal reference levels at 2-3 months, while the levels of NKG2A and TRAIL were higher than the upper limit of the normal reference range throughout the entire follow-up period. NK cells were highly activated, characterized by high expression of activation indicators CD25 and CD69, as well as exhaustion markers PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3, especially on the day of CAR-T cell infusion.
 For patients experiencing cytokine release syndrome (CRS), delayed NK-cell proliferation, CD16 recovery, and NKG2D expression were observed, and a lower percentage of memory-like NK cells was recorded during the observation. A significantly increased proportion of CD56brightCD16-NK cells appeared from day 7 to 2-3 months after CAR-T cell infusion in patients experiencing CRS when compared with those without CRS. Moreover, there were different differentiated profiles of CD56dim NK cells with markedly higher proportions of NKG2A+CD57-, NKG2A-CD57-, and a significantly lower proportion of NKG2A-CD57+ in the CRS group. Furthermore, we found that NK cell counts and the expression of NKG2D and CD16 were negatively associated with peak CAR-T cells or inflammatory molecules (e.g., IL-10, IFNγ, or CRP) levels.
 Clinically, patients with CRS occurrence or a low NK/T ratio (<median) at the end of the first month tended to be more likely to experience virus infection/reactivation. Of note, patients rich in the CD56dimNKG2A+CD57- subset seemed to be more likely to experience CRS, and those rich in the CD56dimNKG2A-CD57+ subset were at high risk of recurrence/progression.
 Conclusions: In conclusion, the number, phenotype, and maturity of NK cells were changed during CAR-T cell therapy. Attention should be paid to the differentiated status of NK cells for CRS and inferior prognosis prediction and prevention. Measures taken to stimulate NK cell expansion and prevent virus infection are also necessary when NK-cell recovery is impaired during CAR T-cell therapy.

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a fatal disease characterized by the abnormal growth of plasma cells. Despite advancements in treatment, many patients experience relapse, particularly those at high risk. Poor outcomes are attributed to the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant stem-like cells, however, the specific genetic factors driving myeloma stemness within the bone marrow niche are still unknown. These insights are crucial for understanding cancer stem cell biology in MM and enabling the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting malignant stem cell generation in MM as well as other lymphoplasmacytic neoplasms. A potential candidate is interferon response factor-4 (IRF4), a transcription factor that regulates B-cell development and is critical for myeloma cell survival. This study investigated the contribution of IRF4 to drug resistance driven by the activation of key stem cell functional pathways at a single cell level, revealing novel mechanisms that connect IRF4 to myeloma regeneration.
 First, to determine the extent to which IRF4 pathway activation drives stem cell gene expression and phenotypes in MM, we enforced IRF4 overexpression in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). We experimentally induced IRF4 using lentiviral vectors compared with negative vector controls as well as wild-type control cells. Functional drug resistance assays revealed that IRF4 upregulation (3-5 days) promoted intrinsic resistance of MM cells to standard-of-care drugs bortezomib and lenalidomide. Complementary whole transcriptome analysis 48 hours after transduction shows a small set of common differentially expressed genes between the three HMCLs. Subsequent gene set enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were enriched for pathways associated with mRNA splicing activity and protein translation - two functions that have previously been linked closely to normal or malignant hematopoietic stem cell function. The majority of IRF4 overexpression-associated genes were upregulated, suggesting that IRF4 turns on transcriptional programs that increase relative mRNA levels of associated genes, revealing mRNA splicing and protein translation as potential novel therapeutic vulnerabilities for MM. Finally, we extended these studies to investigate the molecular impact of IRF4 upregulation at a single cell level using 10X scRNA-seq.
 To explore the clinical relevance of these findings and elucidate connections between IRF4 and stem cell gene expression in single cells from primary patients, we analyzed a public single-cell dataset from analysis of CD138+ cells from healthy and diseased bone marrow (BM) and generated new scRNA-seq clustering, creating more unified clusters compared to published results. We then characterized molecular alterations associated with expression of IRF4 in single cells and discovered that genes related to protein translation as well as a pro-survival transcriptional regulator ATF5, and the hematopoietic stem cell and MM associated cell surface antigen CD74 were correlated in IRF4+ cells. Subsequently, the cells were subdivided into four disease stages: MM, smoldering MM (SMM), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and normal BM (NBM). IRF4 was enriched in MM, SMM and MGUS compared to NBM, while genes CCND2 and IFI6 were found to have the highest fold-change in MM compared to NBM and were upregulated after IRF4 overexpression. These genes have been previously associated with translocations and expression in malignant plasma cells, respectively.
 Together, these data show that overexpression of IRF4 induces malignant stem cell-associated gene expression programs and functional changes in MM cell drug sensitivity. Further evaluation of genes enriched in primary sample-derived IRF4-high versus low cell subpopulations provides essential new evidence supporting a role for IRF4 in risk for transformation of MM from SMM. Additionally, this research uncovers new candidate myeloma stem cell marker genes that were associated with IRF4 expression in MM (e.g. CD74) and identifies mRNA splicing pathways as upregulated in this subpopulation of MM cells. Together, these findings open new opportunities for therapeutic targeting in MM to block IRF4-driven lymphoid oncogenesis, for example with potent splicing modulator agents that are currently in development for other hematologic malignancies.

 Introduction
 Bcl-2 expression is associated with poor outcomes in relapse/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients undergoing standard of care treatment, including patients that fail αCD19 CAR T therapy (CAR T). Venetoclax is a BH3 mimetic that selectively inhibits Bcl-2 protein. We previously observed Venetoclax-induced changes within CAR T cells via flow cytometry, noting heightened populations of TNaive (TN) and TStem Cell Memory (TSCM) memory subsets, decreased population frequency of TRegulatory (TReg) cells, increased cytotoxic effector function, and enhanced activation status. Here, we aim to validate these findings at the transcriptomic level, while elucidating the underlying mechanism supporting these Venetoclax-induced modifications to T cell quality and function.
 Methods
 Transduction was performed on T cells from three healthy donors using lentiviral vectors encoding for 2nd generation α-CD19 CAR constructs, containing CD28 (28ζ) or 4-1BB (BBζ) costimulatory domains, 24 hours after activation using αCD3/CD28 TransACT (Miltenyi). Untransduced T cells (UNT) were used as a nonspecific control. Following 10-14 days of expansion, CAR T cells and accompanying UNT T cells were harvested for downstream application. Briefly, either UNT, 28ζ, or BBζ CAR T cells were co-cultured with chemo-rituximab resistant CD19+ lymphoma model, Raji4RH, for 24 hours with or without Venetoclax-supplemented media. Cultures were then subjected to negative selection by Pan T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi) and submitted for bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq data was analyzed using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm, and a profile of differentially expressed genes (DEG) was created. Log2Fold Change of significant DEGs between Venetoclax-exposed and control (no exposure to Venetoclax) was then calculated for all genes of interest.
 Results
 Significant increase of IFNG (28ζ, Log2FC= 1.8; BBζ, Log2FC= 2.4) and GZMB (28ζ, Log2FC=0.12; BBζ, Log2FC=0.3) expression within Venetoclax-exposed CAR T cells was observed. DEGs governing T cell activation,CD69 (28ζ, Log2FC= 1.93; BBζ, Log2FC= 2.04), and proliferation and survival, IL2 (28ζ, Log2FC= 2.1; BBζ, Log2FC= 3.1) were significantly upregulated. To examine shifts in TN/TSCM and TReg subsets, TCF7, FOXP3, and IL12RB2 were analyzed.TCF7 (UNT, Log2FC= 0.13; 28ζ, Log2FC= -0.08; BBζ, Log2FC= 0.31) expression was significantly upregulated within UNT and BBζ Venetoclax-exposed cells, but not 28ζ. FOXP3 expression was significantly downregulated among all Venetoclax-exposed cells (UNT, Log2FC= -0.47; 28ζ, Log2FC= -0.3; BBζ, Log2FC= -0.4), and IL12RB2 expression was increased among all Venetoclax-exposed CAR T cells (28ζ, Log2FC= 0.35; BBζ, Log2FC= 0.41). BCL2 (28ζ, Log2FC= -0.13; BBζ, Log2FC= -0.14) expression was significantly decreased in all Venetoclax-exposed cells, with MCL1 (28ζ, Log2FC= 0.35; BBζ, Log2FC= 0.14) expression increasing among Venetoclax-exposed CAR T cells. Genes encoding for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria-associated proteins ITPR3 (28ζ, Log2FC= 0.32; BBζ, Log2FC= 0.35), MCU (28ζ, Log2FC= 0.82; BBζ, Log2FC= 0.31), and VDAC1 (28ζ, Log2FC= 1.5; BBζ, Log2FC= 0.1) were significantly increased in all Venetoclax-exposed cells.
 Conclusion
 Our data suggest that Venetoclax induced significant changes in CAR T cell function related to cytotoxicity (IFNG, GZMB), activation and survival (CD69, IL2), memory and immunomodulation (TCF7, IL12RB2, FOXP3), Bcl-2 family expression (BCL2, MCL1), and mitochondrial function (ITPR3, MCU, VDAC1). We sought to define a compensatory mechanism that exists among Bcl-2 family proteins in T cells following Venetoclax exposure. In all Venetoclax-exposed CAR T cells, MCL1 was significantly upregulated, while BCL2 was decreased. Due to localization of Bcl-2 at the ER where it inhibits flux of calcium via IP3R, we posit that Venetoclax induces T cell-intrinsic changes via calcium signaling modulation. Further understanding of how Venetoclax exposure impacts CAR T cell function is vital to enhance the quality of CAR T therapy in R/R DLBCL patients.

 Background: Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy, is incurable and highly prone to relapse. The immunosuppressive cells in the bone marrow environment inhibit endogenous T-lymphocyte activity and reduce the efficacy of T-cell immunotherapies. Bone marrow monocytes in patients with MM correlate with poor survival. This study explored the mechanism of T-lymphocyte suppression by bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in MM.
 Methods: CD14+ monocytes from the bone marrow of patients with newly-diagnosed MM (NDMM) were analyzed, and RNA sequencing was performed. We investigated the regulation effects on T lymphocytes by studying the interaction between CD14+ monocytes and T lymphocytes, as well as the downstream signaling mechanism through in vitro and in vivo experiments.
 Results: By analyzing single-cell RNA sequence data (GSE124310), we discovered that the incoming and outgoing signal strength of CD14+ monocytes from MM was increased compared to healthy controls (HCs). The change in MHC Ⅱ gene signaling of outgoing interaction in CD14+ monocytes was decreased in MM. In our experiment, the proportion of intermediate monocytes was higher in NDMM than in HCs, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of surface CD86, CD80, and HLA-DR in intermediate and classical monocytes was decreased. Abnormal numbers, defective antigen presentation, and downregulated surface co-stimulatory molecules of bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in patients with NDMM were verified. We collected bone marrow samples from 10 NDMM and 5 HCs, and sorted CD14+ monocytes for RNA sequencing. The Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2 (ULK2) gene was significantly upregulated NDMM. The overexpressing ULK2 (oeULK2) gene THP1 cell line was constructed. The oeULK2 and vector THP1 cells underwent high-throughput RNA sequencing. The antigen processing and presentation pathway, involved in T lymphocyte activation, was validated. Compared with the vector THP1, mRNA levels of MHC Ⅰ, TAP1, PSME1/2, HLA-DQB, HLA-DMA, and CTSB were downregulated in the oeULK2 THP1 cells. Reduced levels of MHC Ⅰ, TAP1, PSME1, MHC Ⅱ, CTSB, and CTSL proteins in oeULK2 THP1 were confirmed by WB. The MFI of CD86 of oeULK2 THP1 was found to be decreased. The protein levels of MHC Ⅰ, TAP1, PSME1, MHC Ⅱ, CTSB, CTSL, and the MFI of CD86 in oeULK2 THP1 was upregulated accompanying with various concentrations of ULK1/ULK2 inhibitor (MRT68921) co-culture for 48h. Additionally, the MFI of CD86 and HLA-DR in primary CD14+ monocytes from patients with NDMM was found to be upregulated after 0.5 μM MRT68921 co-culture for 48h. Bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in NDMM suppressed T-lymphocyte activation, indicated by a decrease in the MFI of CD69, GZMB, and TNFα. Administration of MRT68921 to CD14+ monocytes alleviated T-lymphocyte suppression. In vivo experiments were conducted using a mouse xenograft model implanted with RPMI-8226 cells and reconstituted with human CD3+ T lymphocytes and ULK2high or ULK2low/- CD14+ monocytes. Tumor growth was significantly accelerated by infusing ULK2high monocytes. The MFI of CD69, GZMB, and TNFαin CD3+ T lymphocytes from the tumor was significantly decreased after infusion of ULK2high monocytes compared to that in the ULK2low/- monocytes group. The level of serum IFN γwas also decreased in the ULK2high monocytes group.
 Conclusions: We demonstrated that ULK2high CD14+ monocytes in MM hinder the delivery of antigenic peptides through the antigen processing and presentation pathway. This disruption affects T-lymphocyte activation and attenuates their ability to kill and secrete cytokines. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the formation of the myeloma immunosuppressive microenvironment, enhancing the efficacy of T lymphocyte-based immunotherapy, and developing new targeted therapies ULK2.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer (BC) cases worldwide, yet due to its aggressive phenotype and lack of targeted therapies it has the worst prognosis amongst BC subtypes. Up to 40% of TNBC patients will relapse after treatment and develop distant metastasis. Metastasis is the complex process by which disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) leave the primary tumor and grow at distal sites. Since most metastases occur within 3 years of diagnosis, the rapid onset and lack of effective treatments in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) means less than 20% of patients survive after 4 years. Even though it is the most “immune-activated” BC subtype, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown clinical benefits in early TNBC, there is a clear need for novel immunotherapeutic approaches for patients with mTNBC. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that function as the body’s first line defense against metastatic cancer cells. NK cells eliminate DTCs in the blood or at distal sites via NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and this process is known to be impaired in successful metastasis. We hypothesized that other cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can inhibit NKCC at the earliest stages of metastatic outgrowth. We have used Cherry-niche, an in vivo labelling tool, to characterize how TME cells change in early and established lung micro-metastases by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry. Our initial analyses showed that monocytes are highly enriched, not only in the entire metastatic lung, but specifically in the established niche surrounding DTCs. Although we detected a slight increase in total NK cells, there was a shift in maturation status with fewer mature NK cells (CD27-CD11b+) and more immature NK cells (CD27+/-CD11b-) in the metastatic lung. Furthermore, NK cells were largely absent from the metastatic niche and those that were present displayed a dysfunctional phenotype. CellChat and NicheNet analyses of our scRNA-seq data predicted that several receptor-ligand interactions, including the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), can mediate the crosstalk between NK cells and monocytes. Next, we developed an in vitro 3D co-culture system to study the effect of blood-derived monocytes on human NKCC against mTNBC cells. We found that monocytes can suppress NKCC against MDA-MB-231 cells and decrease the viability of mature NK cells. Furthermore, recombinant MIF was able to directly inhibit NKCC, whilst a selective MIF antagonist was able to rescue monocyte-induced impairment of NKCC. These data implicate MIF as a critical monocyte-derived factor in the suppression of NK cell function against mTNBC cells. Future work will aim to identify the exact mechanism by which MIF inhibits NKCC, whilst also evaluate the effect of monocyte depletion and MIF inhibition on metastatic outgrowth and NK cell activation/maturation in vivo. This study will reveal novel inter-cellular dynamics occurring in the metastatic lung, as well as immunotherapeutic targets that may restore NKCC in mTNBC.

 Introduction: Tumor cells use different mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, leading to the remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). TIM is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis and response to treatment in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we hypothesized that different NHL subtypes share common TIM patterns that can predict patient outcomes. Therefore, our objective was to characterize the crosstalk between cancer cells and T cells across different NHL subtypes and its clinical relevance.
 Methods: Biopsies from 64 NHL patients and 16 reactive/non-malignant lymphoid tissues (rLT) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Immune profiling included major lymphocyte subpopulations, as well as the expression of inhibitory (PD-L1, CD112, CD155) and co-stimulatory ligands (CD58, 4-1BBL, ICOSL, OX40L) and HLA-I in B cells, the expression of inhibitory (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM3, LAG3, CD244, CD160) and co-stimulatory receptors (4-1BB, ICOS, OX40) on T cells, T cell differentiation status, Tregs and T-helper cells. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was available for 59 out of 64 patients.
 Results: The characterized tumors included follicular lymphoma (FL) (n=35), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n=14), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (n=7), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (n=4), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) (n=3) and high-grade B cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (n=1). The immune profiling showed a higher percentage of CD58+ and HLA-I negative NHL cells compared to healthy B cells in rLT. Moreover, we observed a significantly higher number of patients with NHL cells expressing PD-L1, CD112 and ICOSL compared to rLT. These results confirmed the loss of surface HLA-I and the expression of PD-1 and TIGIT ligands as common immune evasion mechanisms in NHL. CD4+ T cells were reduced in NHL compared to rLT, while CD8+ T cell levels were not distinct. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibited depletion of the naïve pool and elevated expression of PD-1, TIGIT, LAG3 and TIM3. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressing PD-1 and TIGIT was also significantly higher in NHL. An increased expression of the co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB was observed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from NHL tumors. Additionally, Treg frequency was higher in NHL while there were no significant differences in T-helper subpopulations. Overall, our data showed a skewing of T cells towards an effector profile with increased expression of exhaustion markers in NHL.
 Unsupervised clustering of the samples using the k-means method based on the 54 parameters assessed by immunophenotyping identified 3 different clusters: ‘reactive’ (n=28; 13 rLT, 8 FL, 2 DLBCL, 2 MZL, 2 MCL and 1 BL), ‘indolent’ (n=41; 25 FL, 5 MZL, 5 DLBCL, 3 rLT, 2 MCL, 1 BL) and ‘aggressive’ (n=11; 7 DLBCL, 2 FL, 1 HGBCL, 1 BL). The reactive cluster was distinguished from the indolent and aggressive clusters by lower PD-1 and TIGIT expression, as well as a higher percentage of naïve T cells, CD4+ TCM and total CD4+. The aggressive cluster was differentiated from the indolent cluster by higher expression of inhibitory ligands in malignant cells and elevated TIM3 and LAG3 expression in T cells.
 To cluster based only on TIM elements, we repeated the clustering of the whole cohort but excluding B cell markers. Samples from the reactive cluster were still grouped together, whereas the indolent/aggressive clusters were united into a single one we named as effector/exhausted (E/E). Patients clustered into the reactive group had longer median PFS compared to those in the E/E (79 months vs. 42 months, HR=0.35; p=0.03). Considering only FL cases, the FL cases clustering as reactive also had longer median PFS compared to FL cases clustering as E/E (79 months vs 45 months, HR=0.24; p=0.05). These findings emphasize the clinical relevance of T cell status in the TIM in NHL. In terms of OS, we did not observe significant differences.
 Conclusions: Our results confirmed the different crosstalk between B and T cells in NHL marked by the expression of inhibitory ligands in tumor cells, HLA-I downmodulation, lower CD4+ T cell frequency and higher T cell exhaustion. In addition, T cell-based clustering identified two groups of patients with different PFS, showing how a TIM rich in CD4+ T cells and with low T cell exhaustion is related to better prognosis. Overall, our study points out the potential benefits of deeper immunophenotyping of T cells from TIM to predict patient outcomes.

 Chemotherapy is one of the most common therapies used to treat different types of malignancies. Besides eradicating malignant cells, many healthy cells are also affected. Common chemotherapy-associated side effects include neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for lifelong production of all blood cells and are essential for recovery after myeloablative insult. Despite this, the activation and regulation of HSCs in response to chemotherapy is poorly understood. Herein, we sought to characterize the activation and lineage output of HSCs upon chemotherapy. Specifically, we investigate the role of inflammation and caspase-1 on HSC lineage fate decisions, to gain a better understanding of what drives myelosuppression and recovery after chemotherapy.
 To follow the recovery dynamics of mature hematopoietic cells after chemotherapy treatment, we treated mice with the chemotherapy drug 5-fluououracil (5-FU) and analyzed peripheral blood at seven timepoints post chemotherapy treatment. We show that mice at day 6 following chemotherapy are pancytopenic, with low numbers of leukocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes. Between day 6 and day 12 there was an extensive expansion of the leukocytes and platelets, but not of erythrocytes. Only after day 12 when leukocyte and platelet numbers had recovered to steady state levels or surpassed them, erythrocyte numbers increase.
 Next, we aimed to determine the role of HSCs in the recovery kinetics of the mature lineages. Markers for identifying HSCs are not reliable in this setting since hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transiently lose cKit cell surface expression post treatment. By using alternative cell surface markers, Lin-, CD48-, CD244-, CD150+, EPCR+, we could reliably identify HSC after chemotherapy treatment. To determine if the production kinetics of different hematopoietic lineages are established at the HSC level, we transplanted sorted HSCs two days post chemotherapy to lethally irradiated recipients and found a significantly lower output of donor-derived RBCs (p= 0.0059).
 To assess what transcriptional changes might contribute to the differences in mature lineage output, we performed RNA-seq on HSCs sorted 2 days post chemotherapy treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis showed pathways related to inflammation, myeloid differentiation and long-term HSC maintenance being positively enriched, while pathways related to short-term HSCs and GATA1 targets and protein translation were negatively enriched. Examining specific transcription factors, we found upregulation of HSC specific transcription factors as well as those driving myeloid differentiation, whereas those promoting erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation were downregulated. This indicates a transcriptional priming of HSCs towards myeloid cell production only 2 days after chemotherapy, at the expense of erythroid cells. Furthermore, we observed significant upregulation of genes linked to inflammation. Upon measuring pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the bone marrow 24 hours after chemotherapy, we noted a multi-fold increase of several cytokines, one of which was IL-1β.
 To discern the role of inflammation in lineage fate decisions we utilized a caspase-1 knockout mouse model, as caspase-1 is required to produce mature IL-1β. The cytokine IL-1β has previously been found to influence lineage fate in HSCs (Pietras et al. Nature cell Biology, 2016). Treating caspase-1 KO mice with chemotherapy lead to a diminished output of leukocytes (p= 0.0021) and higher erythroid output (p= <0.0001) compared to WT 5-FU-treated mice. These findings indicate that the lineage bias towards myeloid cells over erythrocytes following chemotherapy treatment, is rescued by the loss of caspase-1 and its role in producing mature IL-1β. In a clinical setting, patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment often experience anemia, something our data suggests could be mitigated by caspase-1 / IL-1β inhibition. Anemia is also a symptom of many inflammatory conditions and diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Investigating caspase-1 and IL-1 β inhibitors in the context of mitigating anemia in patients with such conditions could pose as a viable treatment option.

 Checkpoint inhibitors have been successful in various tumors. However, these treatments have failed in glioblastoma. Approaches harnessing the immune response are hindered by multiple factors, including T cell exhaustion. TOX is particularly important for the transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming of exhausted T cells. While it is known that NFAT is upstream of TOX, our understanding of the upregulation of TOX remains incomplete. We hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) could be involved in the upregulation of TOX as TNF can lead to the translocation of NFAT into the nucleus. We observed significant upregulation of the anti-inflammatory TNF receptor type II (TNFR2) in tumor-infiltrating T cells. This local upregulation mimics expression patterns of canonical exhaustion markers. TNFR2 expression is correlated with markers of exhaustion, including PD1, TIM3, and TOX. Furthermore, TNFR2 knock out (KO) CD8 T cells have significantly lower TOX expression, without the concomitant decrease of TIM3. Whereas previous studies have linked TIM3 and TOX expression, these data suggest that TIM3 and TOX are regulated independently. We utilized bulk RNA-sequencing to assess transcriptional regulation of WT and KO T cells and detected a significant reduction of T cell exhaustion and immune checkpoint pathways in TNFR2 KO T cells. Various exhaustion-related transcription factors and coinhibitory markers were significantly reduced. In contrast, a significant increase in AP1 transcription factors, commonly associated with T cell effector functions, was detected. Given this reduced exhaustion profile, we subsequently investigated the influence of TNFR2 on tumor burden. TNFR2 KO mice had significantly lower tumor burdens following subcutaneous tumor challenges. We subsequently treated mice with a TNFR2 antagonist. While the antagonist alone was not sufficient to improve tumor control, combination with anti-PD1 significantly reduced tumor volumes. These data provide evidence for a novel marker of exhaustion that could result in a unique therapeutic strategy.">

        <tr id="Background The characteristics of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment represent a major challenge that limits the efficacy of immunotherapy. Our previous results suggested that cryo-thermal therapy, a tumor ablation system developed in our laboratory, promotes macrophage M1-type polarization and the complete maturation of DCs to remodel the immunosuppressive environment. However, the cells that respond promptly to CTT have not yet been identified. CTT can cause extensive cell death and the release of danger-associated molecular patterns and antigens. Neutrophils are the first white blood cells recruited to sites of damage and acute inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that neutrophils are the initial cells that respond to CTT and are involved in the subsequent establishment of antitumor immunity. Methods In this study, we examined the kinetics of neutrophil recruitment after CTT via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining and explored the effect of neutrophils on the establishment of systemic antitumor immunity by in vivo neutrophil depletion and in vitro co-culture assays. Results We found that CTT led to a rapid and strong proinflammatory neutrophil response, which was essential for the long-term survival of mice. CTT-induced neutrophils promoted the activation of monocytes via reactive oxygen species and further upregulated the expression of IFN-γ and cytotoxic molecules in T and NK cells. Adoptive neutrophil transfer further enhanced the antitumor efficacy of CTT in tumor models of spontaneous and experimental metastasis. Conclusion These results reveal the important role of neutrophil‒monocyte interactions in the development of anti-tumor immunity and highlight that CTT could be used as an immunotherapy for targeting neutrophils and monocytes to enhance antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction Long COVID (LC) poses a persistent challenge in clinical practice due to limited understanding of its etiology. LC is hypothesized to stem from aberrant immune responses in COVID-19. Vaccinations, which boost immune cells to restore function, could help ease LC symptoms. Methods To exclude the impact of vaccination, we examined the immune cell profiles of recovering COVID-19 patients before vaccines were available. White blood cell differentials were monitored in ninety-twohealthy unvaccinated controls. Seventy-six unvaccinated COVID-19 patients were monitored upon admission and on the 50th day post-symptom onset (DPSO50). Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were analyzed using flow cytometry. Results Mild cases showed no significant changes in lymphocyte counts or subsets from admission to DPSO50. By DPSO50, severe and critical cases showed almost complete recovery from lymphopenia, with critical cases having CD19+ B-cell counts approximately 45% lower than the mild group. Severe and critical cases exhibited reduced B-cell frequencies, with critical cases displaying around 48% higher natural killer (NK) cell counts. In mild cases, NK cell counts negatively correlated with B-cell counts (r=-0.528, p=0.02). Additionally, critical cases showed positive correlations between NK cell counts and CD4+ T-cell counts (r=0.83, p<0.01), and between NK cell counts and CD8+ T-cell counts (r=0.74, p<0.01). Severe cases demonstrated decreased counts of CD4+CD25+CD127lowFoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which positively correlated with B-cell counts (r=0.37, p<0.05). Discussion Our findings indicate that aberrant immune cell profiles in COVID-19 patients change dynamically during recovery, depending on disease severity. This study suggests that convalescent patients from critical COVID-19 may experience long-lasting B-cell lymphopenia.">

 Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to be a challenging leukemia to treat in the modern era. As with other malignancies, the role of the tumor immune microenvironment is helping elucidate how different patients respond to AML and what it could mean for prognosis. Better understanding of the tumor microenvironment, specifically how resting and activated macrophages, as well as resting and activated dendritic cells, could help determine prognostic tools as well as therapeutic targets. Regarding macrophages, they can either be in a M0, M1, or M2 state; corresponding to an undifferentiated, pro-inflammatory, or anti-inflammatory state. M1 macrophages prevent cell proliferation, produce cytokines, and reactive oxygen species. M2 macrophages are involved in cell proliferation and tissue repair. Likewise resting dendritic cells and activated dendritic cells respectively play a role in gathering antigens and activating T-cells. Other reports have shown a relationship between higher a percentage of activated macrophages and activated dendritic cells and longer overall survival in several different malignancies.
 Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) makes publicly available RNA sequencing data for several different tumor types. This project utilizes a sample of 147 patients from the AML TCGA dataset. The sequencing data from all 147 patients were inputted through CIBERSORT which is a Stanford application that helps break down each patient's leukemia microenvironment. Each patient sample is broken down into percentages of various immune cells: B-cells naïve, B-cells memory, plasma cells, CD8 T-cells, CD4 T-cells, T-cells follicular, T-cells regulatory, natural killer activated cells, natural killer resting cells, monocytes, macrophages (M0, M1, M2), activated dendritic cells, resting dendritic cells, activated mast cells, resting mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Once the immune cell fractions are obtained, a statistical tool named Radiant by Shiny is used to perform a linear regression to evaluate the relationship between overall survival and the different immune cells.
 Results: M1 macrophages were independently prognostic of overall survival on multivariable analysis (p = 0.003). The coefficient of correlation was +3704 showing a positive association between the number of M1 macrophages and overall survival. Likewise activated dendritic cells were independently prognostic of overall survival on multivariable analysis (p = 0.038). The coefficient of correlation was +1925 showing a positive association between the number of activated dendritic cells and overall survival.
 Conclusions: Patients with a higher number of M1 macrophages in their AML microenvironment had a longer overall survival. Likewise, patients with a higher number of activated dendritic cells in their AML microenvironment had a longer overall survival. M0 macrophages are in an undifferentiated state and can polarize into a M1 or M2 phenotype. Other publications have hinted at tumor microenvironment variability in different leukemias, but data is scarce on relationships between M1 macrophages and AML. Higher M1 percentages have been linked to better prognosis in colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. This is likely due, in part, to the M1 defense response to foreign invaders, namely the production of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and interleukin-6. In this report, we show that higher amounts of M1 macrophages can also be linked to better prognosis in AML, however whereas higher M2 macrophages correlate to worse prognosis in other cancers, in our analysis there was no association between M2 macrophages and overall survival. This lack of relationship between M2 macrophages and overall survival could be due to the limited sample size of 147 patients. Regarding activated dendritic cells, newer reports are showing the promising utilization of dendritic cell based vaccines in AML therapy. This concept could be related to our findings of higher activated dendritic cells being linked to longer overall survival. The role of the leukemia microenvironment continues to evolve and can lead to substantial therapeutic advancements.

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults and is associated with a dismal prognosis. Venetoclax is a BCL2 inhibitor currently approved as front-line therapy in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) for adults with AML who are unfit for high-intensity chemotherapy. Although venetoclax-based therapy has response rates as high as 70%, a significant proportion of patients experience upfront resistance or relapse with few viable subsequent treatment options. Thus, effective strategies for treating venetoclax-resistant (VR) relapsed/refractory AML remain an unmet clinical need. Natural killer (NK) cells are cytolytic lymphocytes of the innate and adaptive immune system and have been shown to have potent anti-tumor effects as a cellular therapy product for hematologic malignancies. Our group recently showed, however, that venetoclax-resistant AML blasts are less susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Increased interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling is associated with venetoclax resistance (Wang et al., 2024), but its connection to NK cell dysfunction in VR AML has not been fully explored. In this study, we seek to characterize the immunophenotypic alterations induced by IFN-γ on AML blasts and explore the IFN-γ signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in VR AML.
 We investigated the sensitivity of AML blasts to NK cell cytotoxicity through in vitro co-culture assays with human AML cell lines and NK cells derived from a healthy human donor. We found that the venetoclax-resistant versions of the Molm14 and OCI-AML2 cell lines were less susceptible to NK cell killing compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. To confirm the correlation between IFN-γ and VR AML, we quantified IFN-γ levels using the Olink proximity extension assay in 8 paired plasma samples from 4 AML patients pre- and post-HMA plus venetoclax treatment. All 4 patients had received treatment with either decitabine or azacitidine plus venetoclax at the time of residual disease (N = 3) or relapsed disease (N =1). Treatment resistance developed after 1 cycle in 1 patient and after ≥ 2 cycles in 3 patients. European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk categorization ranged from intermediate (N = 2) to adverse (N = 2) risk. We found increased normalized protein expression of IFN-γ in 3 out of 4 patients post-HMA plus venetoclax treatment (corresponding to the time of relapsed or refractory disease). In order to characterize the immunophenotypic alterations induced by IFN-γ that could lead to NK cell resistance, we stimulated WT Molm14 cells with IFN-γ (100 IU/mL for 24 hours) and performed flow cytometry to evaluate the expression of NK cell activating and inhibitory ligands. We found that not only did IFN-γ lead to upregulation of inhibitory classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules and the non-classical human leukocyte antigen-E (HLA-E), but it also induced decreased NK cell mediated lysis compared to vehicle control (20:1 effector to target ratio; 54% vs. 21%, p < 0.0001).
 Given that IFN-γ activates the Janus kinase (JAK) pathway to mediate downstream regulation of immunomodulatory genes, we investigated the potential of the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, to reverse the effects of IFN-γ on altering AML immunophenotype and inducing NK cell resistance. We found that ruxolitinib given at 2 μM for 72 hours not only abrogated the IFN-γ induced upregulation of classical MHC class I and II molecules and HLA-E in WT Molm14 AML cells, but it also rescued IFN-γ mediated decreased NK cell killing (20:1 effector to target ratio; 20% vs. 53%, p < 0.0001).
 These findings reveal that IFN-γ is upregulated in VR AML and associated with a distinct immunophenotype, and that the IFN-γ signaling axis is a potential therapeutic target for enhancing NK cell responses in AML.

 Background:
 The immunosuppressive myeloid tumor microenvironment represents a significant barrier to effective cancer immunotherapies. We and others have previously shown that viral vector-based engineering of mature myeloid cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-M) can overcome immune suppression and endow these cells with antitumor function in preclinical models. CAR-M mediate antitumor responses through both direct phagocytosis of tumor cells and ancillary engagement of the adaptive immune system. However, the limited in vivo half-life of current myeloid immunotherapies restricts their long-term potential activity. We therefore sought to improve the persistence of myeloid-based cellular immunotherapies by genetically engineering primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs).
 Methods and Results:
 To improve the durability and effectiveness of CAR-M therapy, we exploited the dispensability of the myeloid lineage-restricted receptor CD33 for normal myelopoiesis and hematopoietic cell function. Using non-viral CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in to the CD33 locus of primary human hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs), we replaced the normal CD33 gene with that of a tumor-specific CAR or reporter protein, successfully generating CD33CAR and CD33mCherry engineered HSPCs. We then proceeded to test this novel engineered cell therapy product. Immunodeficient mice engrafted with CD33 knock-in human HSPCs reconstituted hematopoiesis and demonstrated long-term, stable gene expression for >8 months during both primary and secondary engraftment. Furthermore, directed integration of the cassette into the endogenous CD33 locus restricted gene expression to the myeloid lineage in vivo.
 To assess the antitumor function of CD33CAR engineered HSPCs, we tested their activity in a humanized xenograft mouse model of metastatic Her2-positive ovarian cancer. Mice engrafted with human CD33HER2CAR HSPCs, bearing CAR-expressing myeloid cells targeting the tumor associated antigen Her2, showed improved tumor control compared to control mice engrafted with CD33mCherry HSPCs that did not contain a CAR. Unexpectedly, despite equivalent human immune subsets and engraftment kinetics in the peripheral blood, flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor digests revealed massive remodeling of the human immune tumor microenvironment within CD33HER2CAR engrafted mice compared to controls. CD33HER2CAR animals showed significantly increased total T cell infiltration, including T cell populations associated with responses to immune checkpoint blockade. We additionally found enhanced expression of interferon gamma-inducible chemokines within the peripheral blood of CD33HER2CAR engrafted mice, indicating a potential mechanism for enhanced T cell recruitment. These findings were particularly surprising given the absence of viral vector induced interferon in this system and suggest that durably engineered, CAR-expressing myelopoiesis is sufficient to remodel the tumor microenvironment toward more favorable immune archetypes.
 Conclusions:
 Nonviral gene knock-in at CD33 within primary human HPSCs reconstitutes long-term myelopoiesis and leads to myeloid lineage-restricted gene expression. Expression of a tumor-specific CAR by myeloid cells derived from CD33 engineered HPSCs remodels the tumor microenvironment by enhancing T cell infiltration.

 H3K27M-mutated diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are universally lethal cancers in children and young adults. Our team previously demonstrated efficacy of GD2-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cells (GD2-CAR T-cells) in preclinical models of DMG of the pons (also called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and DMG of the spinal cord, and opened a Phase I clinical trial (NCT04196413) treating patients with first intravenous (IV) followed by repeated infusions of intracerebroventricular (ICV) GD2-CAR T-cells. We employed high-dimensional analyses to define immune states contributing to CAR-T activity in patients. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) was conducted on 555,406 single cells from 115 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 13 patients before and after CAR-T treatment. This is the largest CSF CAR-T dataset in central nervous system (CNS) tumors and provides insights into the immune biology surrounding CAR-T treatment for CNS malignancies. Patient CSF samples were dominated by T cell and myeloid populations. After CAR-T infusion, patient CSF exhibited an increased fraction of regulatory T cells and myeloid populations from baseline. Myeloid cells in early timepoints after ICV administration demonstrated a unique pro-inflammatory signature, while CSF samples from IV and late ICV timepoints exhibited a suppressive signature. To further explore the immune biology of these myeloid contributors, we developed a patient-derived xenograft model of DMG relapse following low-dose ICV GD2 CAR-T treatment. Using a pharmacological CSF1R-inhibitor, we demonstrate that depletion of microglia/myeloid cells at a specific window following CAR-T administration enhances durability of tumor control. Together, these data display the power of in-depth correlative analyses to identify distinct immune populations that drive durability of response. Key findings from these data will allow for optimization of CAR-T therapies for H3K27M+ DMG patients, providing hope to shift the paradigm of this fatal disease.">

To investigate mechanisms that restrain combination immunotherapy sensitivity in immune-excluded tumors, we used imaging mass cytometry to explore cellular distribution in an immune-evasive KRAS mutant lung cancer model. Cellular spatial pattern characterization revealed a community where CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells were gathered, suggesting localized T cell activation. KRAS-G12C inhibition led to increased PD-1 expression, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, and CXCL9 expression by dendritic cells, indicating an effector response. However, suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) were also found in frequent contact with effector T cells within this community. Lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples showed similar communities. Depleting Tregs led to enhanced tumor control in combination with anti–PD-1 and KRAS-G12C inhibitor. Combining Treg depletion with KRAS inhibition shows therapeutic potential for increasing antitumoral immune responses.">

 Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a B-cell malignancy with a typically indolent course. However, some patients have more aggressive disease and initial treatment can range from observation to chemoimmunotherapy. The reason for this spectrum of disease behavior is incompletely understood but the tumor microenvironment (TME) likely plays a role as recent studies have shown that an optimized antitumor immune response in SMZL patients would allow the immune system to better target malignant B cells and irradicate the disease. Regulatory CD4+T cells (Tregs) are crucial in maintaining TME homeostasis by suppressing effector T cells and malignant B cells and in this study, we therefore explored the key factors influencing the function and development of intratumoral Tregs in SMZL patients.
 We identified two distinct Treg subsets in the TME of SMZL patients: CD26+Tregs and CD161+Tregs, each with unique phenotypic profiles, functions, and prognostic significance. CD161+Tregs suppress CD8+T cells and malignant B cells more effectively than CD26+Tregs, which only inhibit CD8+T cells. Clinically, patients with inferior outcomes have significantly higher numbers of CD26+Tregs and fewer CD161+Tregs. To delineate differences between these subsets, we performed Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes Sequencing (CITE-seq) on biopsies from 7 SMZL patients. We found that cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) is the most highly expressed gene in CD26+Tregs compared to CD161+Tregs, aside from FOXP3.
 CISH has been reported to be a negative regulator of immune effector cell activation in tumor models. Although CISH deficiency leads to a loss of Foxp3 expression and reduced Treg suppressive function, the mechanism by which CISH modulates Treg function, especially immune suppression in hematologic malignancies, remains largely unknown. To further investigate the mechanism of CISH in Treg function in MZL patients, we conducted CITE-seq analysis on a larger cohort of MZL patients (n=12), divided into groups based on outcomes (EFS24 failed, n=4; EFS24 achieved, n=8). The CITE-seq analysis results showed significantly higher CISH expression in Tregs from patients with inferior outcomes (P=1.07E-06).
 We then explored factors influencing CISH expression and found that TCR engagement and treatment with cytokines (IL-15, IL-2, and IL-7) elevated CISH expression in Tregs. While we previously observed that lymphoma B cells could enhance Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD25-T cells, this study we found that B cells could also enhance CISH and CD26 expression in CD4+CD25-T cells in vitro, indicating that a high frequency of B cells in the environment may lead to increased CISH expression in Treg cells leading to an unfavorable outcome in patients.
 We further investigated the role of CISH in the function of Treg cells. Following CISH knockdown in Treg cells, we observed decreased CD26 expression and reduced suppressive function on CD8+ T cell proliferation. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we knocked out CISH in the Karpas 299 cell line, a human T cell lymphoma line that constitutively expresses CD25, Foxp3, and CISH. CISH-KO Karpas 299 cells showed significantly less apoptosis and Foxp3 expression compared to CISH-WT cells. Bulk RNA-seq analysis of CISH-KO and CISH-WT Karpas 299 cells revealed that CISH-KO cells showed enhanced DNA replication and cell cycle pathway activity.
 Taken together, our results suggest that high expression of CISH in Tregs may predict an unfavorable outcome in SMZL patients. Malignant B-cells in the TME of SMZL patients may promote expression of CD26 and CISH in Tregs, thereby modulating Treg function. Targeting CISH could decrease the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs in the TME, potentially optimizing antitumor immunity in SMZL patients.

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia among adults (80% of all cases) and the 2nd most common leukemia in children, has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates among hematological cancers (32%). AML cells alter the programming of immune cells, supporting conversion of anti- to pro-tumorigenic cell types. Macrophages are effector myeloid cells of the innate immune system that can phagocytose tumor cells and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines to recruit and induce anti-tumor immunity but are converted to pro-tumor programming by AML cells to enable AML tumor survival, inducing anti-cell death pathways and reducing drug sensitivity. Pro-tumor macrophages exhibit elevated CD206 (MRC1) expression; CD206 is significantly associated with negative outcomes in AML patients (**P<0.01) and is proposed as a prognostic factor for AML. Fortunately, macrophages exhibit plasticity and can be converted to anti-tumor programming with costimulatory signals. CD40 signaling has been shown to induce antitumor myeloid immunity and agonist CD40 antibodies have been tested in clinical trials. However, enthusiasm for CD40 agonist antibody therapies has been dampened by dose-limiting toxicities, inadequate pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration, and the non-tumor targeted delivery of the antibody modality. Another promising therapeutic approach, adoptive cell therapy (ACT), utilizes living, genetically-engineered T cells that actively localize to sites of tumor and specifically attack tumor cells. ACT is particularly attractive for AML therapy, as ACT is an established therapy for other hematological cancers and T cells naturally home to the sites of AML (blood, bone marrow). We innovate synthetic fusion proteins that combine a membrane-bound protein ectodomain with a costimulatory signaling endodomain (Oda et al, JEM, 2015; Oda et al, Blood, 2020) and fusion proteins that we developed are enteringclinical trials in 2024 and 2025. We developed a combination therapy that employs both innate and adaptive immunity by using ACT to deliver CD40 signals to promote antitumor macrophages at the sites of AML. We developed fusion proteins that combine the ectodomain of CD40 ligand (CD40L) with a T cell costimulatory endodomain, expressed in the T cell membrane, and providing positive signals to both endogenous macrophages and tumor-targeted T cells. We developed several CD40L fusion proteins, termed Dual Costimulatory Receptors (DCR), with different intracellular costimulatory domains. In in vitro studies, CD40L DCRs showed high expression in T cells, enhanced accumulation/proliferation, and significantly enhanced T cell lysis of tumor cells in a Serial Killing Over-time (SKO) assay. We advanced the 3 leading CD40L DCRs to in vivo immunocompetent murine AML studies. In in vivo immunocompetent murine studies, we observed increased M1-like macrophages and increased overall survival following CD40L-HVEM DCR-T cell therapy, but not with control, CD40L-engineered T cell therapy. To determine if CD40L-HVEM DCR-T cell-reprogrammed macrophages would induce synergistic anti-tumor function, we developed a triple-cell SKO with T cells, macrophages, and tumor cells. While the combination of control T cells and macrophages showed similar lysis of tumor cells relative to T cells alone, CD40L-HVEM DCR-T cells and macrophages synergized to produce highly effective tumor eradiation. In studies with human T cells and tumor, CD40L-HVEM DCR-T cells exhibited increased activation and promoted conversion of macrophages to anti-tumor programming in vitro. Here, we show that engineered fusion proteins combined with a tumor-targeted cell therapy can redirect a pro-tumor immune cell subset associated with negative outcomes in AML patients, resulting in significantly enhanced outcomes.

 Introduction. Blood cell production within the bone marrow (BM) niche is hierarchically organized with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at the top, to ensure continuous production of all blood cells throughout life by both self-renewal and differentiation to multi-potent and blood-lineage committed progenitors. The stages of differentiation allow for homeostatic blood cell maintenance within the niche and a high degree of flexible adaptation to increase blood cell output during inflammation. At homeostasis, HSPCs and their resulting mature leukocytes continuously egress out of the BM into the circulation; however, upon inflammation/stress, they undergo rapid mobilization. Homeostasis of myeloid cells is particularly critical as they orchestrate early immune responses to resolve acute inflammatory responses. The duration and magnitude of inflammation is affected by the efficiency of myeloid precursors to mature into neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, egress from the BM, migrate into the infected or injured area, and perform downstream effector functions to resolve inflammation. The molecules and mechanisms that regulate blood cell production, retention, and mobilization are not entirely understood. We recently identified serine threonine protein kinase 25 (STK25) as a new modulator of stress hematopoiesis and myeloid effector function. STK25 is a member of the mammalian sterile 20-like (MST) kinase family and is primarily known to participate in autophagy, cell polarity, apoptosis, and migration, and is thus considered a potential therapeutic target in cancer.
 Methods. 8-10 weeks-old, sex-matched Stk25-/-(KO) and Stk25+/+wild-type (WT) littermate mice, Stk25fl/fl, Stk25fl/fl-Vav-iCre+and Stk25fl/fl-Vav-iCre-mice were immunophenotyped (blood, spleen, BM) by flow cytometric analysis and cell blood counts (CBCs) at homeostasis and in response to inflammation (emergency myelopoiesis). HSPC proliferation and differentiation were assessed by flow cytometric analysis, CFU assays and scRNAseq analysis. In vitro chemotaxis assays were performed with blood and BM neutrophils. Phagocytosis was measured by fluorescence bead uptake; neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and degranulation were quantified by flow cytometric analysis and ELISA. In vivo models of LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thioglycolate-induced peritonitis and wound healing were used to examine myeloid cell differentiation, trafficking and effector function.
 Results. Immunophenotyping revealed a significant reduction in the numbers and percentages of blood monocytes and neutrophils within KO mice; all other cell types were unchanged. Reductions were conserved in the spleen and BM of KO mice. Further, Stk25fl/fl-Vav-iCre+mice phenocopied the defect in blood monocytes and neutrophils, supporting a cell autonomous role for STK25 in myelopoiesis. Given the observed defects in blood and BM, we measured the relative amounts of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEP), granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP) and common myeloid progenitors (CMP), and multipotent progenitors (MPP) in the BM of WT and KO mice. At homeostasis, we observed significant reductions in LK and LSK populations within KO BM, and significant reductions in GMP, LT-HSC, ST-HSC (MPP1), and MPP3 that differentiate into granulocytes and monocytes. We also examined granulopoiesis and found significant reductions in NeP-1 neutrophil progenitors with limited effects on NeP-2. Functional analyses of KOBM and blood myeloid cells identified defective BM egress, in part due to a significant retention of CXCR4+CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils in the BM of KO mice as compared to WT, reduced trafficking of these cells to inflammatory stimuli, reduced phagocytosis of pathogenic stimuli, and reduced NET formation that is required to immobilize and kill invading microorganisms. Results from scRNAseq support these functional findings and lend insight into mechanism(s). Last, KO mice had defective wound healing, with a significant reduction in the infiltration of inflammatory myeloid cells.
 Conclusions. Together, results identify STK25 as a new factor involved in granulocyte-monocyte lineage decision during homeostasis and inflammation. Results also support a role for STK25 in essential myeloid effector functions that are vital for wound healing and inflammation.

        <tr id="Chronic infections with intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) pose significant health challenges due to their capacity to persist within host cells and evade immune responses. This study investigates the cellular responses to chronic Mab infection in macrophages, particularly focusing on cellular senescence. Using an in vitro model of chronic infection in murine alveolar-like macrophages, we found that Mab induces a senescent phenotype characterised by decreased proliferation, altered morphology, DNA damage signalling activation, and upregulation of senescence markers such as p21 and SA-β-galactosidase. Intriguingly, senescent macrophages secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines, consistent with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which promoted secondary senescence in neighbouring uninfected cells. This paracrine transmission of senescence underscores a potentially deleterious effect of Mab-induced SASP on tissue microenvironments, fostering a pro-inflammatory niche that may contribute to pathogen persistence. These findings highlight Mab-induced senescence as a key factor in chronic infection pathology, suggesting that targeting senescent cells and SASP-related pathways could enhance treatment outcomes in chronic bacterial infections.">

Co-culture of ieILC1-like NK cells with the tumor cells resulted in elevated CXCL10 in the supernatant.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Accumulating evidence suggests that phenotype switching of cancer cells is essential for therapeutic resistance. However, the immunological characteristics of drug-induced phenotype-switching melanoma cells (PSMCs) are unknown. We investigated PSMC elimination by host immunity using hyperdifferentiated melanoma model cells derived from murine B16F10 melanoma cells. Exposure of B16F10 cells to staurosporine induced a hyperdifferentiated phenotype associated with transient drug tolerance. Staurosporine-induced hyperdifferentiated B16F10 (sB16F10) cells expressed calreticulin on their surface and were phagocytosed efficiently. Furthermore, the inoculation of mice with sB16F10 cells induced immune responses against tumor-derived antigens. Despite the immunogenicity of sB16F10 cells, they activated the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system and strongly resisted T cell-mediated tumor destruction. However, in vivo treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors successfully eliminated the tumor. Thus, hyperdifferentiated melanoma cells have conflicting immunological properties – enhanced immunogenicity and immune evasion. Inhibiting the ability of PSMCs to evade T cell-mediated elimination might lead to complete melanoma eradication.">

 Background:
 Innate T cells have both deleterious and protective roles in a range of diseases. Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a major type of innate T cell, but their role and clinical relevance after cardiac arrest (CA) are undefined.


 Hypothesis:
 In patients after CA, an early increase in diverse NKT (dNKT) cells correlates with good neurological outcomes. dNKT cells improve outcomes after CA by reducing inflammatory responses in the brain.


 Aims:
 To investigate the clinical relevance of dNKT cells after out-of-hospital CA (OHCA) and their roles in a murine CA model.


 Methods:
 A clinical retrospective cohort study of complete blood cell counts with differentials after OHCA. Single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry of circulating T cells in OHCA patients. Good neurological outcomes were defined as a Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2 at 30 days post-CA. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing(-seq) of hippocampal cells (50,332 nuclei), RT-PCR, and flow cytometry of the brain 24 hours post-CA in mice.


 Results:
 In a large OHCA patient cohort (N=1,955), the percentage of lymphocytes early (less than 12 hours) after CA was independently associated with good neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [95%CI], 1.08 [1.03-1.14], P=0.005). Transcriptional profiling of T cells in OHCA patients at single-cell resolution showed an increase in an innate T cell-like NCAM1
 +
 subset in patients with good neurological outcomes. This subset expressed cytotoxic, cytokine, and chemokine genes. Flow cytometry identified an early increase in circulating dNKT cells in patients with good neurological outcomes post-CA. In a murine model of CA, type II dNKT cells migrated to the brain after CA. NKT cell-deficient mice (Cd1d
 -/-
 ) had increased neuronal injury and mortality after CA. Cd1d
 -/-
 mice had increased molecular and cellular inflammation compared to wild-type mice 24 hours post-CA. Global transcriptomic analysis of murine brain at single-nucleus resolution indicated NKT cells suppressed inflammatory axes post-CA in multiple cell types, including astrocytes, microglia, and inhibitory neurons. Treatment with sulfatide (a lipid antigen for dNKT cells) improved neurological function after CA.


 Conclusions:
 Early abundance of dNKT cells was associated with good neurological outcomes after OHCA. dNKT cells are neuroprotective after CA by suppressing inflammatory axes in the brain. Immunomodulation of dNKT cells via endogenous lipids is a potential treatment approach after CA.

 Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART)-cell therapy has shown little success in glioblastoma and other solid tumors, unlike in hematologic malignancies. The immunosuppressive milieu and intratumoral heterogeneity are some obstacles limiting the effectiveness of CART-cell therapy in glioblastoma. Our goal in this study is to investigate how CART-cell transcriptional adaptations and cellular interactions in the glioblastoma microenvironment drive T-cell hyporesponsiveness. Using a human neocortical slice model, we performed physically interacting cell sequencing (PIC-seq) to investigate the transcriptional diversity of NKG2D CAR-T cells and control T-cells in the glioblastoma ecosystem. Through the integration of spatially resolved T-cell receptors sequencing and PIC-seq, we investigated the cellular and receptor-ligand interactions in CART-treated glioblastoma cells. Gene regulatory networks were reconstructed to identify key transcriptional regulators of CD8 CART-cell dysfunction. We used in-silico perturbation to understand transcriptional drivers that could potentially enhance the cytotoxic response of CAR-Ts. Primary patient-derived glioma cells were inoculated into human neocortical slices from surgical access tissue specimens. After 3 days of tumor growth, slices were treated with NKG2D CARTs or control T-cells. We observed that after 2 days of anti-tumor T-cell response in the CART group, tumor growth did not differ between conditions. After 7 days of treatment, PIC-seq was used to profile CARTs (tomato+) and tumor cells (GFP+) as well as physically connected cells (+/+). We identified a transcriptional shift towards T-cell exhaustion in CART cells compared to T-cells lacking the NKG2D construct. This transcriptional phenotype was driven by myeloid-CART and myeloid-tumor interaction. We identified that tumor-associated macrophages with enhanced phagocytic function in proximity to mesenchymal-like tumor cells located within hypoxic niches are the main drivers of T-cell dysfunction. Gene regulatory network analysis demonstrated that MAF and BACH2 are key transcriptional regulators of CART-cell function. Myeloid-tumor and myeloid-T-cell interactions promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment and hyporesponsive T-cells in glioblastoma. Our data has the potential to catalyze the re-engineering and optimization of CART-cell therapies with sustained cytotoxic effect against glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="Introduction The current study focuses on understanding the functional role of different subsets of endoneurial macrophages in autoimmune polyneuropathies (AP) and traumatic peripheral nerve injury (TPNI), which holds potential for clinical application. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the diverse origins of macrophages within peripheral nerves. However, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding how endoneurial macrophages from different origins affect disease progression in AP versus TPNI. Methods Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze macrophage phenotypes, including polarization states, cytokine production, and myelin phagocytosis in animal models of AP and TPNI. This study focuses on two distinct origins of macrophages, namely CD11b+F4/80hi tissue-resident (TRM) and CD11b+F4/80int blood-derived macrophages (BDM). The study utilized two animal models: the first was the spontaneous autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy (SAPP) model in B7.2-null non-obese diabetic (NOD-B7.2-/-) mice, which serves as a model for inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; the second model involved wild type C57BL/6 mice subjected to sciatic nerve crush injury, modeling TPNI. Behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological analyses were performed to assess peripheral nerve injury. Results The study found that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by macrophages were more pronounced in the peripheral nerves of SAPP mice compared to those with TPNI, with the majority of these macrophages being TRM. In contrast, endoneurial macrophages in mice with TPNI were mainly BDM, exhibiting a less defined macrophage polarization and cytokine profile than TRM in AP mice. Interestingly, myelin phagocytosis was primarily driven by BDM in both SAPP and TPNI mice. Discussion This study offers novel insights into origin-dependent macrophage functions in AP and TPNI. Furthermore, these findings may help the future development of novel therapies targeting macrophage subsets of specific origin in AP and TPNI.">

        <tr id="Malignant glioma, the most lethal form of brain cancer, presents with an immunosuppressive microenvironment that obstructs tumor cell clearance and hampers immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite advancements in characterizing cellular and extracellular profiles in cancer, the immunosuppressive mechanisms specific to glioma remain poorly understood. We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of glioma samples, which revealed a select subset of human and mouse glioma cells that express CD83, a marker associated with mature antigen-presenting cells (APCs). To investigate the impact of tumor cell CD83 expression of glioma outcomes, we employed an immunocompetent mouse model of glioma, bioinformatics analyses of human samples and in vitro assays. Our findings revealed that CD83+ tumor cells contribute to tumor growth suppression and are associated with enhanced cytotoxic T cell profiles and activated CD8+ T cells. Increased proinflammatory cytokines were identified in CD83-overexpressing tumor conditions, which were also correlated with long-term CD8+ antitumor responses. Importantly, tumor-derived CD83 could mediate communication with T cells, altering the immune microenvironment to potentially enhance immune related tumor clearance. Collectively, our data suggest that tumor cell expression of CD83 supports the endogenous anti-tumor T cell constituency in malignant glioma. Future research endeavors may aim to further investigate whether CD83 expression can enhance immunotherapeutic approaches and improve patient outcomes.">

 Background and Purpose:
 Systemic Chronic Active Epstein-Barr Virus disease (sCAEBV) is a refractory disease characterized by the activation and clonal proliferation of EBV-infected T or NK cells, leading to a progressive and fatal course. The primary clinical feature is persistent systemic inflammation. Its only curative treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Blood Adv. 2020;4:2918), but following disease activities of inflammatory symptoms are poor prognostic factors after the treatment: fever, elevated ALT, vasculitis, uveitis, and progressive skin lesions. Elucidating the mechanisms behind the onset and the control of these inflammatory symptoms is essential to establish effective treatments. The aim of this study is to identify cytokines that contribute to the pathogenesis of sCAEBV and serve as biomarkers.
 Materials and Methods:
 The diagnosis of sCAEBV was made based on the diagnostic criteria in accordance to the WHO classification. Cytokine multiplex analysis was performed using the Human Cytokine/Chemokine Panel 38 Plex (EMD Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed using a DNBSEQ-G400 sequencer. Microarray analyses were used to examine gene expression variations in patient cells' pre- and post-CXCL10 stimulation with 3D-Gene Human Oligo chip 25k. The probabilities of overall survival (OS) were visualized by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the comparisons were made using a log-rank test.
 Results:
 We comprehensively analyzed the concentrations of 38 inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of 19 patients with sCAEBV and 47 healthy individuals. Compared to healthy individuals, CXCL10 was identified as a cytokine with significantly higher concentrations in sCAEBV patients. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of sCAEBV patients contain EBV-infected T- or NK-cells. To identify the cells producing CXCL10, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on the PBMCs of five sCAEBV patients whom we could obtain sufficient samples from. CXCL10mRNA was strongly expressed in monocytes. Meanwhile, its receptor, CXCR3, was highly expressed in the fraction of EBV-infected T- or NK-cells of patients. We also confirmed the expression of CXCR3 in EBV-infected cells from patients by flow cytometry. To investigate the effect of CXCL10 on EBV-infected cells, we stimulated sCAEBV-derived cell lines (Br J Hem. 2003:21;805) with CXCL10 and observed the changes. Stimulating at the concentrations corresponding to those in the patient's blood did not affect the proliferation or cell death of the sCAEBV cell lines. However, microarray analysis before and after the stimulation showed significant changes in genes related to cell adhesion. Finally, to verify the significance of CXCL10 as a biomarker, we measured its concentrations before and after chemotherapy. In patients whose disease activity decreased after treatment, CXCL10 levels significantly decreased. Moreover, patients with high levels of CXCL10 at diagnosis resulted in significantly low overall survival rates. Additionally, cases with high levels of plasma CXCL10 (> median) at diagnosis resulted in poorer OS compared to those with low levels (p < 0.05).
 Conclusion:
 CXCL10 has a potential to be a biomarker that reflects treatment efficacy and prognosis of sCAEBV. We need further validation in a larger number of cases and a proof of its role in the pathogenesis to confirm its potentiality.

 Obesity is associated with higher rates of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in part due to tumor-promoting inflammation, altered drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and increased treatment-related adverse events in patients with increased adiposity. Therefore, a large number of patients with this cancer-promoting comorbidity will be eligible for immunotherapy. Given the substantial immunological changes associated with obesity, research focusing on the impact of obesity on cancer immunotherapy is steadily increasing. These efforts have birthed the concept of the “obesity paradox” where obesity has been shown to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in preclinical and clinical studies. However, these studies largely focused on how obesity impacts immune checkpoint blockade therapy targeting solid cancers; whereas, its impact on other forms of cancer immunotherapies is still heavily understudied. Here we show that obesity-induced functional defects in T-cells that affect the functionality of engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells in the context of targeting B-ALL.
 Transcriptomic analysis of T-cells derived from pediatric patients with obesity and B-ALL revealed that T-cells express significantly lower levels of genes encoding T-cell receptor components, coreceptors (CD4 and CD8), T-cell receptor associated tyrosine kinases (FYN), and cytolytic genes (PRF1) compared to results obtained from healthy donors and lean pediatric donors with B-ALL. These transcriptional signatures translated to dysfunctional pediatric patient-derived T-cells from donors with obesity, where we observed that ex vivo stimulation resulted in defective cytokine production (IFN-γ/TNF-α) and attenuated upregulation of cytolytic proteins (perforin/granzyme B).
 Engineering CAR T-cells from pediatric donors with B-ALL revealed that the body mass index (BMI) of the patient did not impact the post-transduction viability of CAR T-cells nor the percentage of CAR-expressing CAR T-cells. However, CAR T-cells generated from patients with obesity expressed higher surface levels of immune checkpoint proteins (Tim-3/Lag-3/Pd-1) and failed to consume glycine and alanine, which are amino acids critical for T-cell proliferation and function. Furthermore, co-culturing patient-derived CAR T-cells with human B-ALL cell lines revealed that CAR T-cells generated from pediatric donors with obesity expressed lower protein levels of granzyme B which correlated with a reduction in the killing efficiency of leukemia cells at all effector to target (E:T) cell ratios tested. These results may explain our previously reported retrospective results, where pediatric and young adult patients with obesity and relapsed/refractory B-ALL experienced significant reductions in progression-free survival and overall survival when treated with commercially manufactured Tisagenlecleucel (Ross et al., 2022 ASH Conference). However, obesity may further complicate the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in pediatric patients due to our observation that the obese bone marrow microenvironment reduces CD19 surface expression on human B-ALL cells.
 Importantly, we were able to recapitulate these findings using murine models of diet-induced obesity. In these studies, CAR T-cells engineered from obese compared to lean mice displayed the same phenotypes as the patient-derived samples including no changes in CAR T-cell viability, similar CAR expression in engineered products, and defective cytolysis of leukemia cells in co-culture assays with CAR T-cells and murine B-ALL cells, particularly at higher E:T ratios. In syngeneic studies conducted in lean mice transplanted with B-ALL cells, we found treatment with CAR T-cells engineered from lean mice conferred complete protection from B-ALL; whereas, treating lean mice with CAR T-cells made from obese mice resulted in over 60 percent of the mice succumbing to disease within 2 months.
 Overall, our clinical and pre-clinical findings demonstrate that obesity impairs CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy in pediatric B-ALL largely due to cell autonomous defects in T-cells which cannot by overcome by the introduction of CD3/CD28-expressing CARs. Furthermore, the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy is negatively impacted by adipocyte-mediated downregulation of CD19 on bone marrow-derived human B-ALL cells.

        <tr id="Mast cell (MCs) activation is the driving force of immune responses in several inflammatory diseases, including asthma and allergies. MCs are immune cells found throughout the body and are equipped with numerous surface receptors that allow them to respond to external signals from parasites and bacteria as well as to intrinsic signals such as cytokines. Upon activation, MCs release various mediators and proteases that contribute to inflammation. This study aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate MC response to interleukin-33 and their target genes using a model of human cord blood-derived mast cells (hCBMCs). hCBMCs were induced with 10 and 20 ng of recombinant human interleukin-33 (rhIL-33) for 6 and 24 h, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from these cells and miRNA profiling was performed using high-throughput microarrays. Differential expression of miRNAs and target analysis were performed using Transcriptome Analysis Console and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The most significant miRNAs in each condition were miR-6836-5p (fold change = 1.76, p = 3E-03), miR-6883-5p (fold change = -2.13, p = 7E-05), miR-1229-5p (fold change = 2.46, p = 8E-04), and miR-3613-5p (fold change = 66.7, p = 1E-06). Target analysis revealed that these miRNAs regulate mast cell responsiveness and degranulation by modulating the expression of surface receptors, adaptors, and signaling molecules in response to rhIL-33 stimulation. This study is the first miRNA profiling and target analysis of hCBMCs that will further enhance our understanding of the role of miRNAs in the immune response in a timely manner and their relevance for the development of a new therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and aberrant cytokine signaling. Methotrexate (MTX) is the preferred first-line treatment for RA, yet its precise mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. This study employed a multi-omics strategy—combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunophenotyping—to identify key effector peripheral immune cells and their cellular responses in RA patients over 12 weeks of MTX treatment. In our study, MTX was associated with significant immune modulation, including the restoration of naïve T and B cells and reductions in T cell memory subsets with these effects detectable as early as three weeks post-treatment. Plasmablast levels also emerged as a potential biomarker for early therapeutic response, reflecting MTX’s impact on immune homeostasis. Transcriptional analysis revealed modulation of key pathways, including TNF-α signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis. Network analysis identified critical regulatory hubs, such as EGR1, JAK2, and SOCS1, in monocytes and CD4 memory T cells, highlighting these cell types as key mediators of MTX’s effects. In conclusion, these findings advance our understanding of MTX’s effects on immune cell dynamics at different stages of treatment, showing for the first time the early cellular changes leading to immune modulation in RA. Altogether, our results provide the foundation for further mechanistic investigations into MTX.">

        <tr id="Computerized chest tomography (CT)-guided screening in populations at risk for lung cancer has increased the detection of preinvasive subsolid nodules, which progress to solid invasive adenocarcinoma. Despite the clinical significance, there is a lack of effective therapies for intercepting the progression of preinvasive to invasive adenocarcinoma. To uncover determinants of early disease emergence and progression, we used integrated single-cell approaches, including scRNA-seq, multiplexed imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics, to construct the first high-resolution map of the composition, lineage/functional states, developmental trajectories and multicellular crosstalk networks from microdissected non-solid (preinvasive) and solid compartments (invasive) of individual part-solid nodules. We found that early disease initiation and subsequent progression are associated with the evolution of immune-suppressive cellular phenotypes characterized by decreased cytotoxic CD8 T and NK cells, increased T cell exhaustion and accumulation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages expressing TREM2. Within Tregs, we identified a unique population of 4-1BB+ Treg subset enriched for the IL2-STAT5 suppressive pathway with transcription profiles supporting discrete metabolic alterations. Spatial analysis showed increased density of suppressive immune cells around tumor cells, increased exhaustion phenotype of both CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing chemokine CXCL13, and spatial micro-complex of endothelial and lymphocyte interactions within tertiary lymphoid structures. The single-cell architecture identifies determinants of early disease emergence and progression, which may be developed not only as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers but also as targets for disease interception. Additionally, our dataset constitutes a valuable resource for the preinvasive lung cancer research community.">

        <tr id="Self-antigens that are obscure to immune cells under homeostasis, are exposed following tissue damage and can trigger autoimmunity. Our previous work showed that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) mediate immunoregulation after traumatic skeletal muscle injury. Here, we found that, immune responses to injury in cDC1-depleted mice (Batf3-/-) mirror those of autoimmune mice (Aire-/-). Mechanistically, we determined that cDC1s prime killer regulatory T cells (CD8+/-Ly49+Tregs) which express Ly49 inhibitory receptors and HELIOS. These killer-like Tregs are clonally diverse and carry T cell receptors associated with self-reactivity and response to hydrophobicity. cDC1 or CD8 deletion promoted CD62L+CCR7+ naïve T cell retention and B cell recruitment to injured muscle. These naïve T cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, strongly correlate with B cell abundance in the muscle and are selectively pruned by CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs. Furthermore, clinically used materials that promote wound healing enrich CD8+/-Ly49+ Treg function whereas those that are associated with pathology promote naïve T cell and B cell accumulation. We hypothesize that CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs maintain self-tolerance after tissue damage and avert autoimmunity by eliminating naive T cells and preventing pathogenic B cell activation.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HPV-negative HNSCC, which arises in the upper airway mucosa, is particularly aggressive, with nearly half of patients succumbing to the disease within five years and limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to other cancers. There is a need to further explore the complex immune landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here, we integrated two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 29 samples and nearly 300,000 immune cells to investigate immune cell dynamics across tumor progression and lymph node metastasis. Notable shifts toward adaptative immune cell populations were observed in the 14 distinct HNSCC-associated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) and 21 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) considering disease stages. All PBMCs and TICs revealed unique molecular signatures correlating with lymph node involvement; however, broadly, TICs increased ligand expression among effector cytokines, growth factors, and interferon-related genes. Pathway analysis comparing PBMCs and TICs further confirmed active cell signaling among Monocyte-Macrophage, Dendritic cell, Natural Killer (NK), and T cell populations. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed significant communication patterns shifts among TICs, between CD8+ T cells and NK cells, showing heightened immunosuppressive signaling that correlated with disease progression. In locally invasive HPV-negative HNSCC samples, highly multiplexed immunofluorescence assays highlighted peri-tumoral clustering of exhausted CD8+ T and NK cells, alongside their exclusion from intra-tumoral niches. These findings emphasize cytotoxic immune cells as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the mechanisms by which the HNSCC sustainably evades immune responses.">

Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Our aim was to investigate the insufficiently understood differences in the immune system between anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive (ACPA+) and ACPA-negative (ACPA-) early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) patients. Methods We performed multiple cytokine assays using sera from drug-naïve ACPA+ and ACPA- eRA patients. Additionally, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45+ cells from peripheral blood samples to analyze and compare the distribution and functional characteristics of the cell subsets based on the ACPA status. Results Serum concentrations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-12 were higher in ACPA+ eRA than in ACPA- eRA. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of 37,318 cells identified 17 distinct cell types and revealed the expansion of IL1B+ proinflammatory monocytes, IL7R+ T cells, and CD8+ CCL4+ T cells in ACPA+ eRA. Furthermore, we observed an enrichment of IFN-γ response genes in nearly all monocytes and T cells of ACPA+ eRA subsets. Heightened interactions between IFN-γ and IFN-γ receptors were observed in ACPA+ eRA, particularly between monocytes and T cells. We examined IFITM2 and IFITM3 as potential key markers in ACPA+ eRA given their pronounced upregulation and association with the IFN response. Specifically, the expression of these genes was elevated in IL1B+ proinflammatory monocytes (likely M1 monocytes), correlating with serum IFN-γ levels. Discussion Compared to ACPA- eRA, ACPA+ eRA showed higher serum IFN-γ and IL-12 levels, upregulated IFN-γ response genes, and enhanced IFN-γ-driven monocyte-T cell interactions. These distinct immune features of the peripheral circulation in ACPA+ eRA suggest a role for type 1 helper T cell-related immunity in its pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Many helminth parasites migrate through multiple host organs during infection but how immunity is regulated across these tissues is still poorly understood. To investigate the cellular and molecular aspects of inter-tissue communication during infection we established a percutaneous infection model with the tissue-migrating nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. High-dimension profiling of the initial cutaneous immune response revealed that dermal γδ T cells become activated, engage cell motility-associated transcriptional pathways and leave the skin after parasite invasion. Chemical and genetic inhibition of leukocyte migration prevents the accumulation of IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the lungs. Notably, bypassing the skin phase of infection, and therefore preventing dermal γδ T cell migration, dampens the increase in early IL-17 production in the lungs, and, instead, leads to enhanced IFN-γ responses together with increased lung damage. Collectively, our data highlights a critical skin–lung axis regulating host-parasite interactions and safeguarding lung health.">

        <tr id="Arming T cells with a synthetically orthogonal IL-9 receptor (o9R) permits facile engraftment and potent anti-tumor functions. We considered whether the paucity of natural IL-9R expression could be exploited for T cell immunotherapy given that, in mice, high doses of IL-9 were well-tolerated without discernible immune modulation. Compared to o9R, T cells engineered with IL-9R exhibit superior tissue infiltration, stemness, and anti-tumor activity. These qualities are consistent with a stronger JAK/STAT signal, which in addition to STAT1/3/5, unexpectedly includes STAT4 (canonically associated with IL-12 but not common γ-chain cytokines). IL-9R T cells are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of proximal signaling, including structure-guided attenuation, amplification, and rebalancing of JAK/STAT signals. Biased IL-9R mutants uncover STAT1 as a rheostat between proliferative stem-like and terminally differentiated effector states. In summary, we identify native IL-9/IL-9R as a natural cytokine-receptor pair with near-orthogonal qualities and an optimal JAK/STAT signaling profile for engineered T cell therapy.">

Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

We demonstrate that endowing CAR T cells with ectopic interleukin-9 (IL-9) signaling by co-expressing an IL-9 receptor, rewires CAR T cell fate under antigen stress to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. In preclinical solid tumor models, IL-9-signaling CAR T cells exhibit increased expansion, persistence, and tumor infiltration, resulting in superior tumor control at significantly lower doses than conventional products. Trajectory and RNA velocity analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that IL-9 signaling alters CAR T cell differentiation under antigen stress away from dysfunction, favoring a multipotent transition toward CD8+ cell memory and effector states, and promoting a CD4+ cell proliferative state. Interrogation of transcription factor pathways indicates that IL-9-mediated activation of STAT1 and STAT4 drives the superior phenotype of IL-9-signaling CAR T cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting solid cancers.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells play a critical role in antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses. We have previously reported that subcutaneous lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (s.c. LCMV) infection is characterized by a stark compartmentalization of CD4+ T cells, leading to strong TH1 polarization but virtually absent T follicular helper (TFH) cells, a key driver of humoral immunity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for this impaired TFH differentiation. We found that T-bet+ cells induced by s.c. LCMV infection encompass a TH1 subset expressing Granzyme-B (GzmB) and a Tcf-1+ subset that retains the potential for TFH differentiation without expressing mature TFH markers. Interestingly, IFN-γ blockade enables full differentiation of Tcf-1+ cells into TFH, formation of germinal centers and increased antibody production. Of note, the suppression of TFH cells by IFN-γ is not directly mediated through CD4+ T cells but rather involves another cell type, likely dendritic cells (DCs). Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms directing early CD4+ T cell polarization and affecting humoral responses to viruses, laying a foundation for the development of effective vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly monocytes and macrophages, play a key role in HIV infection by contributing to viral replication, immune response, and maintaining immune balance during suppressive therapy. We hypothesized that metabolic reprogramming and altered chemokine signaling in people living with HIV (PWH) on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) affect monocyte transport and polarization due to ongoing inflammation. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the mechanism of impaired monocyte/macrophage function in PWH on well-treated ART that can lead to clinical intervention strategies to improve health. Single-cell RNA sequencing, immune-phenotyping, and metabolic modeling identified altered expression of chemokine and metabolite receptors and altered metabolic flux in PWH monocytes that decreased monocyte migration. The plasma secretome revealed a nonclassical inflammatory microenvironment in PWH. Integrative multi-omics and single-cell proteomics of differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) detected metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by α-ketoglutarate (AKG) that affected macrophage function and HIV infection. Increased levels of AKG in plasma were shown to occur in PWH under ART. Therefore, when differentiating MDM with serum from PWH or AKG, macrophage function was found polarized towards an M2-like state. AKG alone was shown to increase CCR5 levels and increase HIV-1 infection in MDM. Here, we utilize systems biology-driven identification and ex vivo assays to show impaired macrophage polarization, due to metabolic training, can leads to a low-grade nonclassical inflammatory environment in well-treated PWH.">

        <tr id="Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized immune cell aggregates that arise in chronic inflammatory conditions. In cancer, TLS are associated with better prognosis and enhanced response to immunotherapy, making these structures attractive therapeutic targets. However, the mechanisms regulating TLS formation and maintenance in cancer are incompletely understood. Using spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging across various human tumors, we found an enrichment of mature dendritic cells (DC) expressing high levels of CCR7 in TLS, prompting us to investigate the role of DC in the formation and maintenance of TLS in solid tumors. To address this, we developed a novel murine model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that forms mature TLS, containing B cell follicles with germinal centers and T cell zones with T follicular helper cells (TFH) and TCF1+PD-1+ progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex). Here we show that, during the early stages of tumor development, TLS formation relies on IFNγ-driven maturation of the conventional DC type 1 (cDC1) subset, their migration to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLN), and recruitment of activated T cells to the tumor site. As tumors progress, TLS maintenance becomes independent of T cell egress from tdLN, coinciding with a significant reduction of cDC1 migration to tdLN. Instead, mature cDC1 accumulate within intratumoral CCR7 ligand-enriched stromal hubs. Notably, timed depletion of cDC1 or disruption of their migration to these stromal hubs after TLS are formed alters TLS maintenance. Importantly, we found that cDC1-mediated antigen presentation to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and intact CD40 signaling, is critical for the maintenance of TLS, the preservation of the TFH cell pool, the formation of germinal center and the production of tumor-specific IgG antibodies. These findings underscore the key role of mature cDC1 in establishing and maintaining functional TLS within tumor lesions and highlight the potential for cDC1-targeting therapies as a promising strategy to enhance TLS function and improve anti-tumor immunity in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="While CD20 was initially characterized as a B cell-specific marker, its expression on memory T cells has expanded our understanding of this molecule’s distribution and function. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized CD20-expressing NK cell population and demonstrate its functional significance. CD56+CD20+ NK cells exhibit hallmarks of cellular activation, including elevated NKp46, CD69, and CD137 expression, enhanced proliferative capacity, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-10). Functional analyses revealed enhanced cytotoxicity against K562 targets, correlating with increased expression of cytolytic mediators including granzymes A, B, and K, perforin, FASL, and TRAIL. Single-cell transcriptional profiling demonstrated that MS4A1-expressing NK cells possess a distinct molecular signature characterized by elevated granzyme K expression and memory-like features. These cells preferentially localize to secondary lymphoid organs and accumulate in inflammatory tissues. Notably, CD56+CD20+ NK cells are enriched in multiple inflammatory conditions, including multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. Treatment with rituximab depletes this population, suggesting potential therapeutic implications. Our findings establish CD20+ NK cells as a functionally distinct lymphocyte subset with enhanced effector capabilities and tissue-homing properties, providing new insights into immune regulation in inflammatory diseases.

        <tr id="Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings. Highlights Anti-PD-1 therapy leads to the accumulation and colocalization of MHCI/II+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and DCs with TCF+ CCL5+ T cells that have high TCR diversity. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy involves multiple T cell checkpoints, TREM2+ macrophages, IL1B+ TREM1+ monocytes and neutrophils, and IFITM+ tumor cells. Simultaneous blockade of PD-1, LAG3, CTLA-4 and TREM2 dramatically prevents progression of both MMRd and MMRp tumors. Combination therapy completely eliminates tumors by leveraging MHC+ macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, facilitating durable anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade can facilitate tumor clearance by T cells, resulting in long term patient survival. However, the capacity of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex), present during chronic antigen exposure, to form memory after antigen clearance remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single cell RNA/T cell receptor sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on antigen-specific T cells after the clearance of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. These data revealed the formation of a robust population of memory CD8+ T cells that transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally resemble central memory T cells (Tcm) that form after clearance of acute infection. To lineage trace the origin and memory recall response of Tex-derived memory clones, we utilized T cell receptor sequencing over the course of primary infection and rechallenge. We show that chronic Tcm are a clonally distinct lineage of Tex derived from progenitor exhausted cells, persist long-term in the absence of antigen, and undergo rapid clonal expansion during rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that αPD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade after chronic LCMV infection preferentially expands clones which form Tcm after clearance. Together, these data support the concept that chronically stimulated T cells form bona fide functional memory T cells through an analogous differentiation pathway to acutely stimulated T cells, which may have significant implications for enhancing immune memory to cancer through checkpoint blockade and vaccination.">

Both pathogens are adept at modulating immune response and, in the case of Mtb, even inducing structural modification of the affected tissue. The present study aimed at understanding the early phenotypical and functional changes in immune cell infiltration in the affected organ, using a humanized mouse model. The humanized mice were infected with either HIV or Mtb in single infection, or with both pathogens in coinfection. Three weeks after the infection, lung samples were collected, and spatial transcriptomics analysis was performed. This analysis revealed high infiltration of CD4+ T cells in Mtb infection, but not in HIV or coinfection. Coinfected mice also showed a minimal number of NK cells compared to the other groups. In addition to infection status, histological features also influenced the immune cell infiltration pattern in the lungs. Two distinct airway regions with distinct immune cell abundance patterns were detected by spatial transcriptome profiling. A lymphoid cell aggregate detected in coinfection lung exhibited distinct transcript profile. The cellular architecture in the lymphoid cell aggregate did not follow the spatial patterns seen in mature granulomas. However, lymphoid cell aggregates exhibited granuloma gene expression signatures, and pathways associated with reactive oxygen species production, oxidative phosphorylation, and TGFβ and interferon signaling similar to granulomas. This study revealed specific transcription patterns, immune responses and morphological alteration signaling in the early stage of HIV and Mtb infections.">

        <tr id="Tumor clearance by T cells is impaired by insufficient tumor antigen recognition, insufficient tumor infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance by these T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promises to reverse T cell suppression in the TME and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. CPIs require the target pathway of inhibition to be active in the TME to elicit a therapeutic response. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of serial killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function against HR+ cancers. Our model provides a means to optimize targets for CPIs used in combination with BATs in clinical strategies. What is already known on this topic Bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapies are adoptive T cell therapies that can effectively reroute T cell cytotoxicity toward cancerous cells, but lack consistent and durable anti-tumor responses. Checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of activated T cells dampen immune responses and can be overstimulated in solid tumors to hamper tumor clearance by T cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs can improve T cell anti-tumor response by blocking checkpoint protein signaling but are only effective if the targeted checkpoint protein is expressed on the T cell and activated in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an opportunity to enhance BAT efficacy by combining treatment with synergistic CPI. What this study adds This study characterizes dynamic, time-resolved patterns in checkpoint protein expression by breast cancer-targeting adoptive T cells and predicts the significance of high-prevalence checkpoint proteins on T cell function. It also demonstrates the use of multivariate statistic and mathematical modeling toward rational design of targets and timing strategies for synergistic combination therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy The output of this study provides justification for therapeutic strategies combining adoptive T cell therapies with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting TIGIT and LAG3 as a means of improving patient responses in HER2-/HR+ breast cancers.">

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cause significant dysfunction among people living with HIV. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for over a million deaths annually. Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-γ timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-γ exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced anti-mycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial clearance. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function. Author Summary Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a major global health threat. While most people exposed to MTB successfully fight off the infection, some individuals develop active disease. Understanding how the bacteria evade immune defenses is key to developing better treatments. In this study, we identify a new role for c-Myc, a protein well-known in cancer research, in suppressing the ability of immune cells called macrophages to fight MTB. Macrophages are responsible for engulfing and killing bacteria, but we found that c-Myc interferes with this process, allowing MTB to survive. Using a small peptide inhibitor called Omomyc, we were able to block c-Myc activity, which restored macrophages’ ability to kill MTB. This effect is linked to changes in cellular metabolism, leading to the increased production of molecules essential for bacterial destruction. We also discovered that high c-Myc levels are associated with persistent MTB infection in both mouse models and human tissues. This suggests that c-Myc helps the bacteria evade immune attack, contributing to long-term infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism exploited by MTB to survive in the body and suggest that targeting c-Myc could be a promising approach to enhancing immune defenses against TB. By bridging insights from cancer biology and infectious disease research, our work provides a new perspective on tackling TB and highlights c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for boosting immunity against this deadly infection.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are critical regulators of HIV immunity, but the mechanisms behind their expansion and value as a therapeutic target remain unclear. We investigated MDSC function in HIV using a humanized mouse model. Acute HIV-1 infection triggered the systemic expansion of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), with their frequency correlating positively with plasma viral load. Notably, PMN-MDSC expansion increased further when natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were depleted, suggesting these immune cells restrain MDSC proliferation. We identified Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis as a regulatory mechanism, as MDSCs expressed high levels of TRAIL receptor 2 (R2), while NK cells and CTLs upregulated TRAIL expression during HIV infection. Treating HIV-1-infected mice with a TRAIL-R2 agonist significantly reduced MDSC levels to those of uninfected mice and significantly improved NK cell and CTL immune function. Crucially, in viremic humanized mice, the treatment prevented CD4+ T cell loss, a hallmark of HIV-1 pathogenesis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting MDSC apoptosis to mitigate CD4+ T cell depletion and enhance HIV-specific immunity, offering a new clinical target to prevent AIDS and insights into MDSC– NK/CTL cross-regulation during HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

        <tr id="Natural resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in some people with HIV (PWH) is unexplained. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells, unstimulated or ex vivo stimulated with Mtb, for 7 PWH who were TST & IGRA positive (called LTBI) and 6 who were persistently TST & IGRA negative (called resisters). Alveolar macrophages (AM) from resisters displayed a baseline M1 macrophage phenotype while AM from LTBI did not. Resisters displayed alveolar lymphocytosis, with enrichment of all T cell subpopulations including IFNG-expressing cells. In both groups, mycobactericidal granulysin was expressed almost exclusively by a T cell subtype that co-expressed granzyme B, perforin and NK cell receptors. These poly-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) over-expressed activating NK cell receptors and were increased in resister BAL. Following challenge with Mtb, only Intraepithelial Lymphocytes-like cells from LTBI participants responded with increased transcription of IFNG. AM from resisters responded with a stronger TNF signature at 6h post-infection while at 24h post-infection AM from LTBI displayed a stronger IFN-γ signature. Conversely, at 24h post-infection only AM from resisters displayed a significant upregulation of MICA transcripts which encode an activating ligand for poly-CTL. These results suggest that poly-CTL and AM mediate the resister phenotype in PWH.">

        <tr id="Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that in humans can be broadly classified into two main subtypes based on their unique TCRδ chain, Vδ1 and Vδ2. Both subsets have potent anti-tumor properties and the presence of Vδ1 cells in the tumor is often associated with positive prognosis. Herein, we investigated the molecular interplay between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), IC blockade (ICB) therapy and γδ T cells. We show that ICRs display differential expression and regulation by the JAK-STAT pathway in circulating Vδ1 and Vδ2 cells and identify constitutive (e.g. TIGIT, PD-1) and inducible (e.g. TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4) ICRs. In melanoma, Vδ1 cells, especially in patients who did not respond to ICB or required combination therapy, expressed high levels of ICR, TOX and inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) transcripts, reminiscent of an exhaustion transcriptional signature. At the same time all γδ T cells had a prominent downregulation in AP-1 transcription factors. Patient derived cells were functionally competent, although induction of LAG-3 and CTLA-4 was impaired. In the context of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Vδ1 cells specifically bound high levels of therapeutic antibody but only in patients who responded to treatment, revealing a potential new prognostic marker for evaluating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Finally, expression of KIR genes in Vδ1 cells was downregulated in response to successful ICB therapy. Collectively, our data indicate an intricate relationship between ICRs, putatively also KIRs, and γδ T cells and reveal novel approaches by which these cells can be harnessed in order to discern or improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Durable T cell immunity against cancer depends on the continual replenishment of effector CD8+ T cells. Thymic output has been correlated with favorable prognosis in cancer patients across a range of ages, suggesting that the thymus is an important source for replenishing T cells capable of controlling cancer progression. However, the effector potential of thymic mature CD8+ T cells and their regulation have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identified the ability of thymic single positive CD8+ T cells to gain effector potential after thymic selection, but they are subject to the regulation of PD-1. We found a previously undisclosed role of PD-1 in limiting both the cytotoxic and exhaustion potential of thymic and peripheral CD8+ T cells. Our results show that although PD-1 inhibition facilitates the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, effector CD8+ cells gradually lose their antitumor activity within tumor tissues due to advanced exhaustion in the absence of PD-1. Thus, although the preset effector potential in thymic mature CD8+ T cells allows them to rapidly respond to malignant cells in the periphery, PD-1, as a checkpoint, is embedded in the thymic mature CD8+ T cells after positive selection to balance their effector function from exaggeration and exhaustion. Therefore, we propose that a strategy capable of upholding the cytotoxic capacity and avoiding exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during the early stages of PD-1 inhibition therapy is needed to achieve durable antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Radiation is used to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the locally-advanced setting. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), in particular, has shown improved outcomes against conventional RT in a number of clinical trials. One key cell type involved in the response to RT are neutrophils. These innate immune cells are the first responders to tissue damage and infiltrate irradiated tumors in high numbers to rectify injury. Neutrophils typically possess an immunosuppressive, wound healing phenotype in this scenario, which allows the tumor to recover and actively suppress immunological efforts to eradicate the disease. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of neutrophils in a murine model of PDAC treated with SBRT. Mice harboring PDAC tumors were treated with targeted SBRT and neutrophils were determined to be significantly increased in the tissue when compared to unirradiated controls. Additionally, phenotypic analysis determined that these cells were largely immunosuppressive and depletion studies confirmed they played a key role in acquired radioresistance in our model. In order to establish whether these infiltrating cells could be re-wired to contribute to anti-tumor immunity, we utilized a novel combination therapy consisting of SBRT and microspheres containing recombinant IL-12 to attempt to repolarize these cells. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed intratumoral neutrophils underwent considerable changes indicative of an immunostimulatory, anti-tumor phenotype following treatment. Moreover, depleting these cells resulted in a loss of treatment efficacy, suggesting that neutrophil re-wiring was vital for the therapeutic outcome. This study highlights neutrophils as key players in SBRT and IL-12 treatment and confirms they can act as a double-edged sword depending on the treatment employed.">

In people with HIV-1 (PWH), CMV is associated with persistence of the HIV-1 reservoir and particular inflammatory related co-morbidities. The true causative role of CMV in HIV-associated pathologies remains unclear given that nearly all PWH are coinfected with CMV. In this study, we examined acute phase SIV dynamics in cohorts of rhesus macaques that were seropositive or -negative for rhesus CMV (RhCMV). We observed expansion of CCR5+ target CD4+ T cells in gut and lymph nodes (LN) that existed naturally in RhCMV-seropositive animals, the majority of which did not react to RhCMV lysate. These cells expressed high levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and a ligand for this receptor, CXCL9, was systemically elevated in RhCMV-seropositive animals. RhCMV+ RMs also exhibited higher peak SIV viremia. CCR5 target memory CD4 T cells in the gut of RhCMV+ RMs were maintained during acute SIV and this was associated with greater seeding of SIV DNA in the intestine. Overall, our data suggests the ability of RhCMV to regulate chemotactic axes that direct lymphocyte trafficking and promote seeding of SIV in a diverse, polyclonal pool of memory CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="It is estimated that two billion people are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can occur in multiple organs, including the lymphatics. The risk of LTBI reactivation increases in immunocompromised conditions, such as coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and during treatment of autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. The immunological correlates of protection against TB, including against reactivation of LTBI, remain largely elusive. Here, we used a mouse model of latent lymphatic Mtb infection to dissect the immunological mechanisms underlying LTBI containment versus reactivation. We show that immunosuppression-mediated reactivation of lymphatic LTBI and the subsequent spread to non-lymphatic organs can be prevented by vaccination with multiple recombinant BCG (rBCG) strains despite the deficiency of CD4+ T cells. Using spatial transcriptomics, multi-parameter imaging, network analysis and bioinformatic integration of histopathological images, we reveal that immunosuppression is associated with a distinct repositioning of non-CD4 immune cells at the edge of TB lesions within the infection-draining cervical lymph nodes. While B cells increased in numbers, they are dispensable for the containment of LTBI. Lymphatic Mtb infection in different immune cell-deficient mouse strains, antibody-mediated cell depletion and adoptive transfer experiments into highly susceptible mice unequivocally show that vaccination-mediated prevention of LTBI reactivation is critically dependent on CD8+ T cells. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of immunity to TB and the management of LTBI. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Patients with cancer often receive chemotherapy to control tumor progression and reduce disease symptoms. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents not only kill rapidly growing cancer cells but also reduce normal cells including myeloid cells, the main innate immune population involved in fighting infections and repairing tissue damages. Rapid loss of myeloid cells caused by chemotherapy triggers myelopoiesis, a process in which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow regenerate myeloid cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, to reconstitute the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported that chemotherapy with an alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice leads to repopulation of myeloid cells that acquire immunosuppressive activities within the monocyte subset. However, detailed information on the cellular composition and molecular identity of these chemotherapy- induced immunosuppressive monocytes is lacking. Here, we investigated how the various myeloid cell subsets in the bone marrow of mice respond to CTX chemotherapy through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq). We found that myeloid progenitor cells and monocytes were reduced 2 days after chemotherapy but rebounded and surpassed their pretreatment levels by day 7. Further scRNAseq analysis of pre-enriched monocytes revealed that the monocyte population was heterogenous, and that chemotherapy tilted myelopoiesis towards the production of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo). We identified Cxcr4 and Cx3cr1 as suitable markers for isolation of chemotherapy-induced NeuMo and demonstrated that these cells were suppressive to T cells. Together with the evidence that CTX-induced monocytes can promote breast cancer metastasis in mice, our data reveal the heterogeneity of the monocytes reemerging after chemotherapy and identify the NeuMo subset as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer.">

        <tr id="Uncertainty persists regarding the contribution of tissue macrophages to HIV reservoirs, largely due to insufficient characterization of these reservoirs within their native tissue microenvironments. This study aimed to characterize and quantify macrophage reservoirs in human lymph node (LN) tissues in terms of their phenotype, location, and their potential for sustained productive infection during suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We examined the topology, nature, and size of macrophage reservoirs in lymph nodes (LNs) from 45 PLWH subtype C on suppressive ART and 14 matched controls using in situ imaging and multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy. Germinal center CD68+ macrophages harbored HIV gag-pol DNA, HIV gag-pol RNA and Gagp24 protein. Digital droplet PCR confirmed the presence of proviral reservoirs in myeloid cells within LNs. High-resolution imaging techniques revealed that infected macrophages within GCs displayed distinct morphological characteristics, featuring larger and irregular shapes. In contrast, phagocytic macrophages exhibited intracellular staining for CD4+ T cells, had regular shapes, and were predominantly found outside the GCs. Our findings provide detailed quantitative, spatial, and phenotypic characterization of macrophage reservoirs in LNs, offering a clear estimation of the extent to which macrophages contribute to persistent HIV reservoirs in these tissues. These findings establish a basis for developing targeted strategies aimed at the elimination of these reservoirs in LN tissues. Author summary HIV hides in reservoirs within immune cells across the body in the blood and various tissues, making it a complex challenge to cure. Therefore, it is essential to identify and understand all sources of HIV reservoirs aid the development of an HIV cure. Macrophages are increasingly recognized as key contributors of viral reservoir persistence. However, the role of macrophages as latent HIV reservoirs remains unclear due to limited studies in human tissues. In this study we investigated macrophage reservoirs in human lymph nodes to answer key questions: where do they hide, how can we identify them, what is their contribution to the lymph node reservoir burden, and are they truly able to support productive viral replication? We found that macrophages residing within lymph node germinal centers, identified by CD68 expression, contained HIV DNA, RNA, and Gagp24 protein. Moreover, using high resolution microscopy, we were able to distinguish between productively infected macrophages from those that engulfed T cells. By unveiling these unique features of macrophage reservoirs, our research paves the way for the design of targeted therapy aimed at eliminating these reservoirs, towards an HIV cure.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) rarely respond to ICB. Accumulating evidence indicates that the complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacts the efficacy of ICB therapy. Therefore, investigating how TME components in MM influence ICB treatment is urgent. Methods We employed two well-established murine myeloma models, 5TGM1 and Vk*MYC, by intravenously injecting 5TGM1 or Vk*MYC cells into mice, respectively, to determine ICB therapeutic efficacy in MM. Total mouse IgG or Ig2b ELISA or QuickGel split beta SPE kits and in vivo bioluminescent imaging were used to monitor MM tumor burden. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) was used to quantify MM TME components. T cell proliferation and function were detected using flow cytometry. Peptide-Fc fusion proteins were used to deplete myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MMDTR, Foxp3DTR, CD4 KO and CD8 KO mice were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Gene expression levels in human MM were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus public datasets. Results We found that programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody treatment had a therapeutic effect in 5TGM1 mice; it was ineffective in Vk*MYC mice. CyTOF indicated that the bone marrow (BM) of both models was inflamed, suggesting that immune suppressive cells might be inhibiting the reactivation of T cells in the BM. We observed higher numbers of MDSCs, regulatory T (Treg) cells, and tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) in myeloma BM compared with that of tumor-free mice. Specifically, depleting MDSCs, but not Treg cells or TAMs, sensitized Vk*MYC mice and enhanced the response of 5TGM1 mice to PD-1 ICB, which was dependent on CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells. MDSCs, especially M-MDSCs and CD84+ MDSCs, significantly inhibited the activation and cytotoxic cytokine production of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Moreover, database profiling of patient BM revealed a negative correlation between MDSCs signature genes and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell signature genes, with post-maintenance patients with myeloma displaying a higher ratio of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell to MDSCs signature genes compared with pretreated patients. Conclusion Our study highlights the potential of MDSCs depletion in enhancing the sensitivity of patients with myeloma to PD-1 ICB therapy.">

        <tr id="While most people contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, some individuals develop active disease, usually within two years of infection. Why immunity fails after initially controlling infection is unknown. C57BL/6 mice control Mycobacterium tuberculosis for up to a year but ultimately succumb to disease. We hypothesize that the development of CD4 T cell dysfunction permits bacterial recrudescence. We developed a reductionist model to assess antigen-specific T cells during chronic infection and found evidence of CD4 T cell senescence and exhaustion. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 T cells upregulate coinhibitory receptors and lose effector cytokine production. Single cell RNAseq shows that only a small number of CD4 T cells in the lungs of chronically infected mice are polyfunctional. While the origin and causal relationship between T- cell dysfunction and recrudescence remains uncertain, we propose T cell dysfunction leads to a feed-forward loop that causes increased bacillary numbers, greater T cell dysfunction, and progressive disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction CAR-T cell therapy, though successful in hematologic malignancies, faces challenges in solid tumors due to limitations of autologous T cells. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells can be given safely across allogeneic barriers and constitute alternative effector cells generated from healthy donors. CIK cells are a heterogenous population of predominantly T cells with a mixed natural killer (NK) phenotype and combine non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity with potent anti-tumor capacity of the adaptive immune system. Here, we characterize and compare efficacy, phenotypic subpopulations and modes of action of CAR-CIK cells and conventional CAR-T cells from same-donor samples in ErbB2+ rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Methods To benchmark CAR-CIK against conventional CAR-T cells, effector cells were generated from same-donor samples and lentivirally transduced with a second generation CD28-CD3ζ CAR. Effector subpopulations and their dynamics upon target cell exposure were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Efficacy was assessed in human ErbB2+ RMS cancer cell lines and primary patient samples in vitro and ex vivo using cytotoxicity and spheroid co-incubation assays. Modes of action were assessed by comparing cytokine secretion profiles using bead-based multiplexed flow cytometry and by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry whole cell proteomics. Finally, we used an in vivo model of RMS mimicking minimal metastatic residual disease to compare anti-tumor potency of CAR-CIK vs. CAR-T cells and to assess their target organ infiltration. Results In vitro assays demonstrated superior cytotoxicity of CAR-CIK cells against RMS cell lines and primary tumor samples. Long-term co-incubation with tumor spheroids led to expansion of CAR-CIK cells and enrichment of CD3+CD56+ TNK cells. CAR-CIK cell cytokine signature showed significantly increased secretion of effector molecules like interferon-γ, perforin and granulysin, and lower secretion of Th2 cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10. Whole cell proteomics showed corresponding upregulation of chemokine signaling and NK-cytotoxicity pathways in CAR-CIK cells. In NSG mice xenografted with ErbB2+ RMS, a single injection of either CAR-effector cells strongly impeded metastatic tumor development and significantly improved survival. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that CAR-CIK cells are at least equipotent to CAR-T cells. Combined with their favorable safety profile and allogeneic applicability, these findings position CAR-CIK cells as promising immune effectors for solid tumors.">

The nutrient-limited conditions of the TME, particularly the scarcity of glucose, amino acids, and lipids, challenge cancer cell survival1–4. However, the metabolic constraints faced by immune and stromal cells in comparison to cancer cells, and how these limitations affect therapeutic outcomes, remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce Dual Ribosome Profiling (DualRP), a method that allows for simultaneous analysis of translation and identification of ribosome stalling, revealing amino acid shortages in different cell types within tumors. Using DualRP, we uncover that interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts trigger an inflammatory response, mitigating amino acid limitations during glucose starvation. In immunocompetent mouse models, we observe that immune checkpoint blockade therapy induces serine and glycine restrictions specifically in T cells, but not in cancer cells. We further demonstrate that these amino acids are essential for optimal T cell function both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting their critical role in effective immunotherapy. Our findings show that therapeutic interventions create distinct metabolic demands across different tumor cell types, with nutrient availability significantly influencing the success of immunotherapy. DualRP’s ability to explore cell type-specific metabolic vulnerabilities offers a promising tool for advancing our understanding of tumor biology and improving therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a debilitating pulmonary disorder that occurs due to persistent exposure to beryllium (Be) particles in the workplace. Be-exposure causes activation of the innate immune system, resulting in the secretion of interleukins and chemokines that drive the accumulation of B and T cells in the lungs. However, the mechanisms by which innate molecules influence the recruitment of B cells and B cell-mediated protection in CBD are poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiple approaches to examine the role of innate immune signaling and CD4+ T cells in B cell recruitment and function in the lungs. We show that the absence or blocking of IL-1R1 signaling prevents the recruitment of B cells to the lungs of BeO-exposed mice. Additionally, we show that B cell recruitment to the lungs depends on the chemokine receptor, CXCR5, and CD4+ T cells. In BeO-exposed mice, lung B cells down-regulate IgM but showed an increased IgD and CD44 surface expression. Further, RNA sequencing of pulmonary tissue-specific B cells in CBD revealed distinct gene signatures compared to splenic B cells, with increased expression of pathways involved in antigen presentation, tight junction interactions, and interferon signaling. Overall, our study shows that B cell recruitment and aggregate formation during CBD depend on sequential activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.">

        <tr id="Antitumor immune surveillance is the key feature of tumour progression and response to treatment in various malignancies, such as lymphomas. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are bone marrow (BM)-derived cells with potent suppressive properties, implicated in T cell inhibition and tumour dissemination. In Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), circulating MDSCs constitute the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, while the contribution of BM MDSCs in disease pathogenesis remains elusive. In the present study we aimed to evaluate both the frequencies as well as the molecular signatures of MDSCs in blood and BM from newly diagnosed DLBCL patients prior to treatment initiation and from age matched healthy donors. Circulating levels of total, monocytic (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSCs were found increased in DLBCL compared to healthy control, while in DLBCL patients the BM MDSCs were significantly increased compared to blood. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significantly different molecular fingerprints to characterize circulating and BM M-MDSCs, implying that MDSCs exhibit their function with distinct mechanisms depending on the anatomical compartment. Despite that MDSC frequencies did not demonstrate any significant correlation with disease characteristics and outcome, our findings propose that gene expression profiling should be evaluated for their potential prognostic impact. Overall, the findings presented here, provide new insights in the immunosuppressive networks that operate in DLBCL and importantly propose new molecular mechanisms expressed by BM MDSCs which may be explored therapeutically.">

        <tr id="Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are capable of mounting an adequate antimicrobial inflammatory response to pathogens while tolerating commensals. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of immune sensitivity remain incompletely understood, particularly in the context of human IECs. To enhance our understanding of the immune response of IECs to bacterial epithelial barrier breach, we investigated whether epithelial responsiveness is contingent on cell identity and cell polarization. We exposed human intestinal organoids to bacterial antigens to study their immune responses. Notable discrepancies were observed in the specific reactions exhibited by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enterocytes. It was determined that basolateral exposure of IECs to bacterial antigens resulted in a robust response, whereas apical exposure elicited a significantly more modest response. We identified ISCs as the responders, while the reaction of enterocytes was found to be attenuated. The regulation of bacterial responsiveness in enterocytes occurs at multiple levels, including the modulation of NFκB activation and post-transcriptional control of mRNA stability. Our findings demonstrate that differentiated non-responsive enterocytes can be sensitized to bacterial antigens through the activation of the WNT pathway. These findings extend the crucial role of WNT signaling for intestinal epithelial homeostasis and regulation of stem cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue architecture in the gut. Additionally, they reveal a new function of WNT signaling in regulating microbial responses within the intestinal environment.">

The immense potential MSC-EVs hold as tumour-targeted therapeutics warrants an understanding of potential adverse events to support clinical translation. This study aimed to determine whether MSC-EVs would elicit an immune response following administration in tumour-bearing immunocompetent animals. Secreted EVs were isolated from both human and murine bone marrow derived MSCs and characterized. hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs were administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour-bearing Balb/c mice or healthy controls. Tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and flow cytometry performed targeting T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The 4T1 model immune profile was first determined by comparing the spleen of tumour-bearing animals to healthy controls. T cells were increased in tumour-bearing animals (CD4+/CD25+ p=0.041; CD8+/CD25+ p=0.02). A significant elevation of GR-1+ MDSCs (p=0.002), CD11b+ macrophages (p=0.023) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (p=0.001) was also observed. In contrast, CD27+ NK cells were significantly decreased compared to the spleen of healthy animals (p=0.006). Collectively this data validated the immune profile and supported the determination of any changes in response to hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs administration. No significant activation of CD4+ (p=0.20) or CD8+ (p=0.57) T cells were seen in tumour tissue in both groups. The percentage of GR-1+ MDSCs (28% vs 27%, p=0.92), CD11b+, CD11c+ and CD27+ cells were similar regardless of EV origin. No significant changes in T cells, MDSCs, macrophages, dendritic or NK cells were observed in the lymph node or spleen of animals that received hMSC-EV versus mMSC-EVs. In conclusion, human MSC-EVs elicited no discernible immune response in mice, supporting the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune privilege of the secretory cell. This reinforces the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs.">

        <tr id="Background: Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have potent immunomodulatory abilities, particularly in a milieu of hyperactive immune system, through secreting a number of cytokines, growth factors, bioactive compounds and peptides, and by cell-cell contact. During viral infection, failure of immuno-neutralization of the viral particles, recruits T-lymphocytes (T-cells) that clear the virally-infected cells. MSCs greatly potentiate T-cells anti-viral activity. Objective: The objective of this study is to assess the ability of the cytokine-primed MSCs to activated T-cells, towards an antiviral application. Method: Human umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs) were isolated from Wharton Jelly of a consented donor. UC-MSCs were primed with interferon (INF)-γ and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. Peripheral blood T-cells were isolated using mini-max and CD3+ population was purified using anti-CD3 immuno-magnetic beads. Naïve or primed MSCs were co-cultured with naïve and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated CD3+ T-cells. T-cell activation was evaluated by changes in their rate of proliferation by cell count, flowcytometric immuno-phenotyping for CD25 expression, and IL-6 secretion in the conditioned medium. Results: The findings revealed that CD3+ T-cells count nonsignificant differed comparing the five experimental groups; Naïve MSCs, Naïve T cells, coculture with naïve MSCs, coculture with primed MSCs, and upon phytohemagglutinin-activation, despite a nonsignificant reduction of proliferation in the last two groups’ coculture. Only the coculture with the primed MSCs showed significant activation of T-cells assessed as CD25 expression compared to the other groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The undetectable levels of IL-6 in the conditioned medium of naïve MSCs, turned markedly high after their cytokine-priming (p < 0.001), reaching nonsignificant difference compared to naïve T-cells. Compared to naïve MSCs, naïve T-cells secreted considerable amounts of IL-6 (p < 0.001). Incubation of naïve MSCs with phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cells further the secretion of IL-6, to a level significantly higher than all of the aforementioned three groups; naïve MSCs, naïve T-cells and primed MSCs (p < 0.001, p = 0.0194, and p < 0.001, respectively). However, coculture of the cytokine-primed MSCs with phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cells dampened IL-6 secretion to a level that was significantly lower than that observed with naïve MSCs-phytohemagglutinin-activated T-cells coculture (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The cytokine-primed UC-MSCs significantly upregulated CD25+ expression on T-cells, while hindering IL-6, without affecting their proliferation rate. This may point to potentially stronger antiviral effects, while alleviating the viral infection-induced cytokine storm.">

NK cells play an important role in the control of malignant disease but the nature of tumour-infiltrating and peripheral NK cells in OC remains unclear. Methods Using flow cytometric analysis, we studied the phenotype and function of NK cells in blood, primary tumour and metastatic tissue in 80 women with OC. The cell type contexture of metastatic OC tissue was explored utilising scRNAseq analysis, with a focus on portraying an immunogenic tumour microenvironment and determining the characteristics of a dysfunctional NK cell population. Results The proportion of peripheral NK cells was markedly elevated with a highly activated profile and increased cytotoxicity. In contrast, NK cell numbers in primary tumour and metastasis were substantially reduced, with downregulation of activatory receptors together with elevated PD-1 expression. scRNA-Seq identified 5 NK cell subpopulations along with increased exhausted and immature NK cells within tumour tissue compared to normal tissue. These features were attenuated following chemotherapy where higher levels of activated and cytotoxic NK cells associated with improved disease-free survival. Correlation of NK cell phenotype with clinical outcomes revealed high levels of DNAM-1 expression on tissue-localised and peripheral NK cells to be associated with reduced survival. Expression of PVR, the DNAM-1 ligand, was significantly increased on tumours and DNAM-1 mediated NK cell lysis of primary tumour tissue was observed in vitro. Discussion These findings reveal profound modulation of the tumour tissue and systemic profile of NK cells which likely contributes to the high rates of local progression and metastasis seen with OC. Immunotherapeutic approaches that overcome local immune suppression and enhance DNAM-1-targeted lysis of OC offer the potential to improve disease control.">

        <tr id="The discovery of immune checkpoints and the rapid growth of immuno-oncology (IO) have sparked tremendous efforts to utilize the immune system to treat a wide range of cancer types/subtypes. While the major focus of IO over the past decades has been to manipulate the adaptive immune system, recent attention has been given to manipulating the innate immune system to treat cancer and/or to enhance adaptive responses. In this work we detail the intracellular protein, Dual Specificity Phosphatase 11 (DUSP11), as an innate immune checkpoint (iIC) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of this atypical phosphatase is correlated with patient survival for multiple cancer types, and we show here that its activity is important for the viability of lung cancer cells in vitro. Specifically, we demonstrate that DUSP11 knockdown in LUAD cells induces apoptosis and an innate immune response capable of activating other cells in vitro, and we provide evidence that these phenotypes are primarily mediated by the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). Finally, we show that expression of DUSP11 is important for tumor engraftment and growth of human LUAD in mice. Overall, these data are the first to establish DUSP11 as an immunosuppressive, pro-neoplastic, and potentially targetable protein in LUAD. In addition, our data suggests that the anti-cancer mechanisms induced by diminishing the activity of DUSP11 are likely to be generalizable to other cancer types such as breast cancer, warranting future investigation and therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent NK cell-stimulating cytokine, but the presence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) can inhibit IL 12-induced NK-cell cytotoxicity. Thus, we hypothesized that trabectedin, a myeloid cell-depleting agent, would improve the efficacy of IL-12 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In vitro treatment of healthy donor NK cells with trabectedin increased expression of the activation marker CD69 and mRNA expression of T BET (Tbx21), the cytotoxic ligands TRAIL (TNFSF10) and Fas ligand (FASLG) and the dendritic cell (DC)-recruiting chemokine lymphotactin (XCL1). The combination of IL-12 and trabectedin increased NK-cell cytotoxicity, activation and production of IFN-γ, TNF-α and granzyme B in the presence of human TNBC cells. Treatment of 4T1 and EMT6 tumor-bearing mice with IL-12 and trabectedin led to a significant reduction in tumor burden compared to single-agent controls, and the highest levels of plasma IFN-γ, intratumoral CD8+ T cells and conventional type 1 DC. MDSC and M2-like macrophages were significantly decreased with combination therapy. NK-cell depletion abrogated the effects of combination therapy, as did elimination of CD8+ T cells. NK-cell depletion led to lower levels of the NK cell-derived chemokine CCL5 and the DC-derived chemokine CXCL10, higher tumor burden, and decreased intratumoral CD8+ T cells. IL 12 and trabectedin also significantly enhanced the response of TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy. These data suggest that MDSC depletion augments the ability of IL-12-activated NK cells to drive the infiltration of DC and CD8+ T cells into TNBC for an antitumor effect.">

        <tr id="HIV persists in diverse tissues, with distinct cellular reservoirs presenting a major barrier to a cure and requiring targeted therapeutic strategies to address this heterogeneity. Here, we developed tissue models of HIV latency using human tonsillar, intestinal and cervicovaginal tissues. These models revealed differential HIV infection across CD4+ T cell subpopulations, with ART partially restoring CD4+ T cells and reducing intact HIV DNA. T follicular helper cells (TFH CD69+ CCR7-) were the primary inducible reservoir in tonsils, while tissue-resident memory cells (TRM CD69+ CD49a+) dominated in the intestine. Identification of markers for inducible reservoirs revealed that CD69, CD45RO, and PD-1 were shared across tissues, while CXCR5 in the tonsils and CD49a in the intestine served as tissue-specific markers. Furthermore, using different latency reversal agents (LRAs) we found that Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACis) failed to induce HIV in any tissue, the SMAC mimetic AZD5582 was effective only in a resident-memory CD4+ T cell subpopulation in the intestine, and IL15 exhibited the broadest reactivation potential across tissues and CD4+ T subsets. These models recapitulate key aspects of HIV infection providing insights into the inducible reservoir’s composition in different tissues and informing strategies for its elimination.">

 CD4+ memory T cells (Tm) drive chronicity of inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD). Variability in response to treatments specifically targeting Tmem hamper disease management. Recently, we have established that a subgroup of pediatric CD patients with high frequencies of circulating gut-homing IFN-g-secreting ex-Th17/Th1* TIGITneg Tmem at time of diagnosis develop a severe disease course. Specifically, they fail to reach remission within 6 months or lose remission within 1 year, despite anti-TNF treatment. As neutrophils are key targets of Tmem function, we hypothesized that pathogenic gut-homing IFN-g-secreting ex-Th17/Th1* TIGITneg Tmem alter intrinsic neutrophil transcriptional programming at an early stage, before the cells enter the tissue, associating with therapy resistant intestinal disease.



 We analyzed clinically well-characterized therapy-naive pediatric CD patients (n=33) and IBD-negative controls (IBDneg;n=15) from the PIBD-SETQ cohort at time of diagnosis; performed bulk RNA-seq of purified circulating neutrophils, bulk RNAseq of intestinal biopsies, multiparameter flow cytometry of circulating immune cells and plasma proteomics using Proximity Extension Assay technology.



 At diagnosis, CD neutrophils differentially expressed 263 genes (DEGs) compared to IBDneg neutrophils. CD neutrophil transcriptomes were enriched for pathways related to neutrophil activation, granule biology, and IFN signaling. Hierarchical clustering of CD patients on the basis of the 263 DEGs identified two patient clusters: cluster_1 with a neutrophil transcriptional pattern similar to IBDneg, and cluster_2 with a pronounced enrichment in IFN and TNF signaling and complement genes. In line with our hypothesis, neutrophil cluster_2 patients had higher frequencies of circulating gut-homing IFN-g-secreting ex-Th17/Th1* TIGITneg Tm, reduced frequencies of inhibitory Tm and higher plasma concentrations IFN-g pathway-associated proteins including IFN-γ, CDCP1, and CXCL9 compared to cluster_1 patients.
 Crucially, lesional colonic biopsies of neutrophil cluster_2 patients were transcriptionally distinct from cluster_1 with a signature of increased IFN-g signaling, extracellular matrix re-organization and Fc-receptor expression but did not differ in the number of infiltrating neutrophils/mm2 or histological disease activity.
 In line with this distinctive immunotype, cluster_2 patients had higher clinical disease scores, higher endoscopic scores and lower rates of normal FCP remission at 1 year after diagnosis despite similar anti-TNF use compared to cluster_1 patients.



 We define a subgroup of pediatric CD patients who have a distinctive pathogenic Tm-neutrophil immunotype at diagnosis and develop severe therapy resistant disease.

        <tr id="Antibody production is central to protection against new pathogens and cancers, as well as to certain forms of autoimmunity. Antibodies often originate in the lymph node (LN), specifically at the extrafollicular border of B cell follicles, where T and B lymphocytes physically interact to drive B cell maturation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts. In vitro models of this process are sorely needed to predict aspects of the human immune response. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) offer the opportunity to approximate the lymphoid environment, but so far have focused primarily on memory recall responses to antigens previously encountered by donor cells. To date, no 3D culture system has replicated the engagement between T cells and B cells (T—B interaction) that leads to antibody production when starting with naïve cells. Here, we developed a LN-MPS to model early T—B interactions at the extrafollicular border built from primary, naïve human lymphocytes encapsulated within a collagen-based 3D matrix. Within the MPS, naïve T cells exhibited CCL21-dependent chemotaxis and chemokinesis as predicted. Naïve T and B cells were successfully skewed on chip to an early T follicular helper (pre-Tfh) and activated state, respectively, and co-culture of the latter cells led to CD38+ plasmablast cells and T cell dependent production of IgM. These responses required differentiation of the T cells into pre-Tfhs, physical cell-cell contact, and were sensitive to the ratio at which pre-Tfh and activated B cells were seeded on-chip. Dependence on T cell engagement was greatest at a 1:5 T:B ratio, while cell proliferation and CD38+ signal was greatest at a 1:1 T:B ratio. Furthermore, plasmablast formation was established starting from naïve T and B cells on-chip. We envision that this MPS model of primary lymphocyte physiology will enable new mechanistic analyses of human humoral immunity in vitro.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally, with an increased death rate despite recent advancements in research and therapeutic options. Different molecular subtypes of GC have distinct interactions with the immune system, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME), prognosis, and reaction to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME are crucial for preventing tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by research showing that patients with GC who have a significant density of TILs have better survival rates. But cancer cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, both sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) playing a pivotal role in the development of an immunosuppressive TME. They prevent T cell activation and proliferation resulting in a decrease in the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. These immune checkpoint molecules function via different but complementary mechanisms, the expression of Siglec-15 being mutually exclusive with PD-L1 and, therefore, providing a different therapeutic approach. The review explores how TILs affect tumor growth and patient outcomes in GC, with particular emphasis on their interactions within the TME and potential targeting of the PD-L1 and Siglec-15 pathways for immunotherapy.">

While the majority of these cells express a conserved CD8αβ+ TRAV1-2 T cell receptor recognizing microbially-derived Vitamin B2 intermediates presented by the evolutionarily conserved major histocompatibility complex I-related molecule, MR1, there is an emerging appreciation for diverse subsets that may be selected for in humans with distinct functions, including subpopulations that co-express CD4. Prior work has not examined T cell receptor (TCR) heterogeneity in CD4+ MAIT cells, largely due to bias of identifying human MAIT cells as CD8+ TRAV1-2+ cells. In this study, we adopted an unbiased single-cell TCR-sequencing approach of total MR1-5-OP-RU-tetramer-reactive T cells and discovered that CD4+ MAIT cells express highly diverse TRAV1-2 negative TCRs. To specifically characterize this TCR repertoire, we analyzed VDJ sequences of single MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+ MAIT cells across two datasets and identified distinct TCR usage among CD4+ MAIT cells including TRAV21, TRAV8 (TRAV8-1, TRAV8-2, TRAV8-3), and TRAV12 families (TRAV12-2, TRAV12-3), as well as more variable J chain and CDR3 sequences. Non-TRAV1-2 MAIT cell TCRs were also enriched after in vitro expansion, including with Mycobacterial tuberculosis. These results indicate that mature human CD4+ MAIT cells adopt distinct TCR usage from the canonical TRAV1-2+ CD8+ subset and suggest that alternative MR1 ligands in addition to riboflavin intermediates may select them.">

        <tr id="Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.">

Immune cells, epithelial cells, and stromal cells may have distinct contributions to disease pathogenesis.

Furthermore, EV treatment of monocytes induced a novel anti‐inflammatory phenotype characterised by CD14+, CD16−, CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2−) and programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1)+ cells. In addition, Ascaris EVs induced T cell anergy in a monocyte‐dependent mechanism. Targeting professional phagocytes to induce both direct and indirect pathways of immune modulation presents a highly novel and efficient mechanism of EV‐mediated host‐parasite communication. Intra‐peritoneal administration of EVs induced protection against gut inflammation in the dextran sodium sulphate model of colitis in mice. Ascaris EVs were shown to affect circulating immune cells and protect against gut inflammation; this highlights their potential as a subject for further investigation in inflammatory conditions driven by dysregulated immune responses. However, their clinical translation would require further studies and careful consideration of ethical implications.">

        <tr id="Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) is a host-restriction factor that plays multiple roles in the antiviral defense of innate immune responses, including the inhibition of viral particle release from virus-infected cells. BST2 may also be involved in the endothelial adhesion and migration of monocytes, but its importance in the immune system is still unclear. Immune cell adhesion and migration are closely related to the initiation of immune responses. In this study, we found that the expressions of the lymph node homing marker chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and an adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were associated with BST2 expression. Interestingly, Bst2−/− cDCs showed lower chemotactic ability, including velocity and accumulative distance toward chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19) gradient in vitro, compared to wild-type cDCs. Bst2−/− cDCs also showed reduced migration and reduced retention capacity in draining lymph nodes in vivo. As a result, Bst2−/− cDCs as antigen-presenting cells induced lower antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses compared to Bst2+/+ cDCs. Notably, mice administered the influenza vaccine via Bst2−/− cDCs exhibited substantially inefficient virus clearance compared to mice administered the Bst2+/+ cDCs vaccine. Therefore, we propose that BST2, which plays a critical role in the effective migration and retention of cDCs, is involved in the development of optimal immunological effects in draining lymph nodes.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint blockade is a standard-of-care treatment for mRCC patients, but the immune mechanisms driving clinical benefit remain underexplored. In the I-RENE trial (NCT04891055), we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and lymphoid dynamics and their impact on the efficacy of nivolumab.
 Methods:
 The I-RENE study is a prospective, translational, real-world multicenter trial involving mRCC patients treated with nivolumab after failure of previous VEGFR-targeted therapies. Sixty patients were enrolled between December 2018 and August 2022. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected at baseline and at 2, 4, and 12 weeks, as well as at disease progression. PBMCs were analyzed by high-resolution flow cytometry (profiling 144 lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets), and plasma was assessed using multiplex analysis (69 soluble factors). CD14+ monocytes from PB and tumor tissue were subjected to RNA sequencing.
 Results:
 Significant immune modulations in PB were detectable as early as 2 weeks into treatment across all patients, regardless of clinical response, and persisted throughout the 3-month observation period. These changes included substantial alterations in the profiles of immune cells and plasma soluble factors. Responders to nivolumab exhibited a marked reduction in monocyte subsets associated with immune suppression, such as CD14+HLA-DR- cells, CD14+PD-L1+ cells, and intermediate monocytes. In contrast, non-responders showed a progressive increase in suppressive monocytes and a concomitant decrease in CD14+ cells involved in anti-tumor immunity, including non-classical monocytes and CD14+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CX3CR1. Lymphoid compartment analysis revealed that responders experienced an increase in CD8+ T cells and CD4+ effector memory T cells, along with a reduction in CD38+ T cells. Conversely, non-responders showed significant upregulation of senescent CD8+ T cells (KLRG1+CD28-CD57+) and CD38+ T cells. All progressing patients showed a notable resurgence of suppressive myeloid cells (HLA-DR-, PD-L1+), confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature, as well as an increase in PB CD38+ and senescent T cells. Notably, the detrimental role of myeloid-driven immune suppression in non-responders was further confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature in matched tumor samples.
 Conclusions:
 The pervasive and detrimental impact of myeloid cells committed to immune suppression is evident even before radiological progression in mRCC patients and persists despite immunotherapy. These findings highlight the need for early identification of immune-suppressive infiltrates and the development of strategies to overcome or reprogram these cells, both at the systemic and tumor level, following diagnosis.

        <tr id="Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating but poorly-understood disease. ME/CFS symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include immune system effects alongside incapacitating fatigue and post-exertional disease exacerbation. In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system . These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, and opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Adaptive immune resistance in cancer describes the various mechanisms by which tumors adapt to evade anti-tumor immune responses. IFN-γ induction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was the first defined and validated adaptive immune resistance mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to adaptive immune resistance as immune modulatory secreted and integral membrane proteins are dependent on ER. Sigma1 is a unique ligand-regulated integral membrane scaffolding protein enriched in the ER of cancer cells. PD-L1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is translated into the ER and processed through the cellular secretory pathway. At the cell surface, PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint molecule that binds PD-1 on activated T-cells and blocks anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 can also be incorporated into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), and EV-associated PD-L1 can inactivate T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that a selective small molecule inhibitor of Sigma1 can block IFN-γ mediated adaptive immune resistance in part by altering the incorporation of PD-L1 into cancer cell-derived EVs. Sigma1 inhibition blocked post-translational maturation of PD-L1 downstream of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling. Subsequently, EVs released in response to IFN-γ stimulation were significantly less potent suppressors of T-cell activation. These results suggest that by reducing tumor derived immune suppressive EVs, Sigma1 inhibition may promote antitumor immunity. Sigma1 modulation presents a novel approach to regulating the tumor immune microenvironment by altering the content and production of EVs. Altogether, these data support the notion that Sigma1 may play a role in adaptive immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that develops in the bone marrow (BM) and the second-most-common blood cancer. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are emerging cytolytic immune effectors showing potent antitumor activity. In MM patients, ILC2s from peripheral blood possessed a cytotoxic arsenal, enabling them to kill MM cells via DNAM-1. In contrast, ILC2 resident in BM did not exert anti-myeloma activity, and instead became more susceptible to apoptosis. Specifically, MM cells led to ILC2 cell death by inducing and engaging the inhibitory receptor TIGIT. Collectively, ILC2s from MM patients displayed an imbalance in the DNAM-1/TIGIT axis, resulting in the conversion from a cytolytic to an exhausted profile. These findings support the employment of anti-TIGIT mAb to restore the survival and antitumor effects of ILC2s in MM.">

        <tr id="T cell exhaustion is important to protect the host from immunopathology during chronic viral infection, but it also impairs T cell anti-tumor immunity1–5. A fundamental unresolved question is whether and how T cell exhaustion is determined at the onset of TCR signaling6–8. Here we report an unexpected role of Themis, a TCR-proximal signaling molecule9, in T cell exhaustion. Chronic viral infection in mice usually leads to T cell exhaustion and survival of the host. Surprisingly, Themis T-cell conditional knockout mice died from severe CD8+-dependent lung immunopathology in chronic viral infection, showing Themis’ importance in establishing T cell exhaustion. We found that Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells were hyperactivated at the single-cell level - producing more TNF and IFNγ compared to wild-type counterparts - but defective in population-level expansion. Moreover, TCF-1 and TOX expression were inhibited in Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing differentiation of exhausted T cell precursors (T-pex) and maintenance of terminally exhausted T cells (T-ex), respectively. Mechanistically, Themis initially promotes TCR signaling to induce PD-1 expression and subsequently mediates PD-1 signaling. In the latter, Themis binds to PD-1 and promotes PD-1 phosphorylation and its recruitment of SHP2, thereby acting as a negative regulator to inhibit T cell effector functions. Without Themis, the orderly regulation of TCR and PD-1 signaling, and therefore exhaustion, is disrupted. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that Themis-mediated early TCR signaling plays a decisive role in T cell exhaustion and provide a novel mechanism of PD-1 signaling through Themis.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity, causing approximately 1.3 million deaths annually. As a highly successful pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved numerous strategies to evade host immune responses, making it essential to understand the interactions between Mtb and host cells. G-protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, contributes to the regulation of pro-inflammatory reactions and the migration of innate immune cells, such as macrophages. Its role in mycobacterial infection, however, has not yet been explored. We found that GPR84 is induced in whole blood samples from tuberculosis patients and Mycobacterium marinum (Mm)-infected macrophage models. Using a Mm-wasabi infection model in mouse tails, we found that GPR84 is an important determinant of the extent of tissue damage. Furthermore, from our studies in an in vitro macrophage Mm infection model, it appears that GPR84 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and increases intracellular lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, thereby promoting intracellular bacterial survival. Our findings suggest that GPR84 could be a potential therapeutic target for host-directed anti-TB therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Background Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are characterized by impaired immune response that fails to eliminate HBV. Immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) control the amplitude of the activation and function of immune cells, which makes them the key regulators of immune response. Methods We performed a multiparametric flow cytometry analysis of ICMs and determined their expression on intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in untreated and treated patients with HBV in comparison with non-pathological liver tissue. Results The liver of untreated HBV patients exhibited a high accumulation of PD-1+CD8+ T cells, while the frequencies of 4-1BB+ T cells, 4-1BB+ natural killer (NK) cells, and TIM-3+CD8+ T cells were the highest in the chronic hepatitis phase. Our findings showed that the HBeAg status is linked to a distinct immune phenotype of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells characterized by high expression of ICMs, particularly 4-1BB. Importantly, antiviral treatment partially restored the normal expression of ICMs. Finally, we described important differences in ICM expression between intrahepatic and circulating NK cells in HBV patients. Conclusions Our study shows clear differences in the intrahepatic expression of ICMs on NK cells and T cells in chronic HBV patients depending on their clinical stage.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents significant clinical challenges due to its limited treatment options and aggressive behavior, often associated with poor prognosis. This study focuses on Kindlin-2, an adaptor protein, and its role in TNBC progression, particularly in hematopoiesis-mediated immune evasion. TNBC tumors expressing high levels of Kindlin-2 induce a notable reshaping of hematopoiesis, promoting expansion of myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. This shift correlated with increased levels of neutrophils and monocytes in tumor-bearing mice over time. Conversely, genetic knockout of Kindlin-2 mitigated this myeloid bias and fostered T cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, indicating Kindlin-2's pivotal role in immune modulation. Further investigations revealed that Kindlin-2 deficiency led to reduced expression of PD-L1, a critical immune checkpoint inhibitor, in TNBC tumors. This molecular change sensitized Kindlin-2-deficient tumors to host anti-tumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression in immune-competent mouse models. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, and immunohistochemistry data supported these findings by highlighting enriched immune-related pathways and increased infiltration of immune cells in Kindlin-2-deficient tumors. Therapeutically, targeting PD-L1 in Kindlin-2-expressing TNBC tumors effectively inhibited tumor growth, akin to the effects observed with genetic Kindlin-2 knockout or PD-L1-KO. Our data underscore Kindlin-2 as a promising therapeutic target in combination with immune checkpoint blockade to bolster anti-tumor immunity and counteract resistance mechanisms typical of TNBC and other immune evasive solid tumors. Implications: Kindlin-2 regulates tumor immune evasion through the systemic modulation of hematopoiesis and PD-L1 expression, which warrants therapeutic targeting of Kindlin-2 in TNBC patients.">

 Failure to respond to the anti-α4β7 integrin therapy, vedolizumab, is observed in a subset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, potentially linked to distinct T cell activation profiles. This study aims to characterize the transcriptional and phenotypic features of circulating memory CD4⁺ T cells in vedolizumab non-responders and their association with treatment resistance.



 We performed multidimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze IBD patients' circulating memory CD4⁺ T cell compartment, comparing pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood samples from vedolizumab responders and non-responders. Proteogenomic analysis and TCR repertoire profiling of CD4⁺ T cells were conducted using matched peripheral blood samples. Flow cytometry characterized T cell subsets based on surface markers, migration receptors, transcription factors, and cytokine expression, focusing on differences in activation and migration profiles.



 Ki67⁺ cells were enriched in the memory CD4⁺ T cell population of vedolizumab non-responders in both UC and CD, confirmed by two independent cohorts. TCR repertoire analysis showed increased diversity in memory CD4⁺ T cells post-treatment. Single-cell sequencing and proteomics revealed these Ki67⁺ cells had a high activation and proliferation profile (HLA-DR, CD40LG, MKI67) with reduced IL7R and SELL expression. They displayed elevated integrins (α4, β1, β7) and gut-homing receptors (CXCR3, CCR6). Upregulated T-bet, EOMES, and RORγt and increased IL-17A, indicated a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotype in non-responders.



 Ki67⁺ memory CD4⁺ T cells are significantly enriched in the peripheral blood of vedolizumab non-responders, displaying a distinct transcriptional and phenotypic profile characterized by Th1/Th17 polarization, high integrin α4β1 expression, and enhanced gut-homing capacity. These findings indicate that proliferating effector memory CD4⁺ T cells could contribute to therapy resistance in IBD, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic strategies targeting these cells in anti-α4β7 integrin therapy non-responders.

To characterize the mechanisms underlying tumor-host interactions, we utilized a BioID-based proximity labeling method to identify proteins secreted by Ykiact adult Drosophila gut tumors into the bloodstream/hemolymph. Among the major proteins identified are coagulation and immune-responsive factors that contribute to the systemic wasting phenotypes associated with Ykiact tumors. The effect of innate immunity factors is mediated by NFκB transcription factors Relish, dorsal, and Dif, which in turn upregulate the expression of the cachectic factors Pvf1, Impl2, and Upd3. In addition, Ykiact tumors secrete Eiger, a TNF-alpha homolog, which activates the JNK signaling pathway in neighboring non-tumor cells, leading to cell death. The release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from these dying cells presumably amplifies the inflammatory response, exacerbating systemic wasting. Targeting the inflammatory response, the JNK pathway, or the production of cachectic factors could potentially alleviate the debilitating effects of cancer cachexia.">

        <tr id="High-risk pediatric neuroblastoma patients have a dismal survival rate despite intensive treatment regimens. New treatment options are thus required. Even though HLA expression in neuroblastoma is low and immune cell infiltrates are limited, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is indicative for better patient survival. Here, we show that most tumor lesions contain viable immune cell infiltrates after induction chemotherapy, with high percentages of CD3+ T cells. We therefore expanded the TILs and tested their anti-tumoral activity. With sufficient starting material, TIL expansion was as efficient as for adult solid tumors. However, whereas TIL products from adult tumors almost exclusively contained αβ T cells, in neuroblastoma-derived TILs, γδ T cells expanded with similar efficacy as αβ T cells. Importantly, the anti-tumor responses in response to autologous tumor digest primarily originated from (Vδ1- and Vδ3-expressing) γδ T cells, and not from αβ T cells. In conclusion, this finding creates a window of opportunity for immunotherapy for neuroblastoma patients, with γδ T cells as potential prime responders.">

Despite intensive research and the use of new therapeutic options such as immunotherapy, the 5-year survival rate is not higher than 50% for male individuals, meanly affected by HNSCC, and has not been significantly improved over the last 20 years. The immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is characteristic of head and neck tumors (HNCs), contributes significantly to the failure of new therapy concepts. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify pro- and anti-tumorigenic immune cell populations in the HNSCC tumor environment with a special focus on the B cell subsets, as recent data assign B lymphocytes a significant contribution to tumorigenesis. In addition to an increase in anti-tumorigenic germinal center (GC) B cells, we describe here for the first time the population of marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of HNSCC with pro-tumorigenic potential.">

 ACOD1 is the ubiquitous source of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate. We hypothesised monocyte ACOD1 expression is an inhibitory pathway that limits intestinal inflammation.



 We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of colonoscopic biopsies from >120 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and healthy controls, with complementary analysis of DSS treated C57BL/6J (WT) mice, validated using flow cytometry in independent cohorts. Acod1–/– mice received 2% DSS in acute and recovery models, complemented by competitive bone marrow chimeric mice, anti-IFN / itaconate-derivate treatment and transgenic cell depletion models.



 We profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of intestinal CXCL9/10+ cells that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs).
 These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate specific expression of IBD susceptibility genes, including NOD2. By performing cross-species analysis in mice, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete MDP-precursor in the bone marrow and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans.
 Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production.



 Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health. Reduced itaconate production from IAMs in CD may predispose to chronic inflammation and disease progression.

        <tr id="Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare T-cell malignancy characterized by inflamed and painful rash-like skin lesions that may affect large portions of the body’s surface. Patients experience recurrent infections due to a compromised skin barrier and generalized immunodeficiency resulting from a dominant Th2 immune phenotype of CTCL cells. Given the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in normal and malignant T-cell development, we investigated the impact of UPR-inducing drugs on the viability, transcriptional networks, and Th2 phenotype of CTCL. We found that CTCL cells were >5-fold more sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Btz) and exhibited a distinct signaling and transcriptional response compared to normal CD4+ cells. The CTCL response was dominated by the induction of the HSP70 family member HSPA6 (HSP70B’) and, to a lesser extent, HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78). To understand the significance of these two factors, we used a novel isoform selective small-molecule inhibitor of HSPA5/6 (JG-023). JG-023 induced pro-apoptotic UPR signaling and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors and other UPR-inducing drugs in CTCL but not normal T cells. Interestingly, JG-023 also selectively suppressed the production of Th2 cytokines in CTCL and normal CD4+ T cells. Conditioned media (CM) from CTCL were immunosuppressive to normal T cells through an IL-10-dependent mechanism. This immunosuppression could be reversed by JG-023, other HSP70 inhibitors, Btz, and combinations of these UPR-targeted drugs. Our study points to the importance of the UPR in the pathology of CTCL and demonstrates the potential of proteasome and targeted HSPA5/6 inhibitors for therapy.">

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disease characterized by the dysregulation of multiple factors, including host immunity. The intestinal activation of T cells showing cytotoxic activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production is one of the key factors in its pathology. Therefore, targeting pro-inflammatory leukocytes from the circulation and in the inflammatory site is a reasonable therapeutic goal. CCR9 is the main activator of gut-tropism in the lymphocytes and responsible for the activation of migratory responses in lymphocytes into the lamina propria.
 SBR1 is a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR9 mAb showing high-affinity and specific binding towards CCR9+ cells. Displaying effector functions such as Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP), SRB1 shows specific depletion of infiltrating and circulating CCR9+ cells in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patient samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.



 Matching blood and 5 mm gut explants were obtained from IBD patients, then they were cultured for 16h with SRB1 and subsequently, CCR9+ cells were characterized by flow cytometry. The culture supernatants from these explants as well as blood samples from the same patients were analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokine production by Multiplex cytokine immune assay. Finally, in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) CCR9 cell depletion was determined by flow cytometric assays at doses of 8, 15 y 25 mg/kg.



 We showed that CCR9 is highly expressed in intestine samples from IBD patients, especially in T cells, but also in other cell types including dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Treatment with SRB1 was able to effectively deplete CCR9+ cells, specifically T CD4+ CCR9+ and CCR9+ memory T cells from blood and intestinal samples from IBD patients. This depletion also reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the culture media. Finally, SRB1 also showed efficacy depleting CCR9 in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) at different doses without showing any secondary adverse effects. All these data suggest a potential therapeutic potential of the antibody in the pathogenesis of IBD patients.



 SRB1 delivers potent blood and tissue depletion of CCR9 expressing cells ex vivo and in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patients’ samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SRB1 (anti-CCR9 mAb) a novel therapeutic approach for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases including CD and UC.

        <tr id="T cells, as integral components of the adaptive immune system, recognize diverse antigens through unique T cell receptors (TCRs). To achieve this, during T cell maturation, the thymus generates a wide repertoire of TCRs. This is essential for understanding cancer evolution, progression, and the efficacy of immunotherapies. Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are hematological neoplasms that are characterized by immune evasion mechanisms, with immunotherapy giving only modest results thus far. Our review of TCR repertoire dynamics in these diseases reveals distinct patterns: MDS patients show increased TCR clonality with disease progression, while AML exhibits varied TCR signatures depending on disease stage and treatment response. Understanding these patterns has important clinical implications, as TCR repertoire metrics may serve as potential biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response, particularly in the context of immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation. These insights could guide patient stratification and treatment selection, ultimately improving therapeutic outcomes in MDS and AML.">

The presence of both intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity limits understanding of biological mechanisms leading to tumor resistance, including immune escape. An attractive field of research to examine treatment resistance are immune signatures composed of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers and cytokines. CD markers are surface markers expressed on various cells throughout the body, often associated with immune cells. Cytokines are the effector molecules of the immune system. Together, CD markers and cytokines can serve as useful biomarkers to reflect immune status in patients with GBM. However, there are gaps in the understanding of the intricate interactions between GBM and the peripheral immune system and how these interactions change with standard and immune-modulating treatments. The key to understanding the true nature of these interactions is through multi-omic analysis of tumor progression and treatment response. This review aims to identify potential non-invasive blood-based biomarkers that can contribute to an immune signature through multi-omic approaches, leading to a better understanding of immune involvement in GBM.">

        <tr id="T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) have demonstrated promising results in patients with solid tumors. However, the underlying immunological and molecular mechanisms influencing these clinical outcomes require in depth evaluation. T cell exhaustion, a state induced by prolonged antigen exposure, is known to undermine T cell-based immunotherapies, though its specific impact on TCB efficacy remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of TCBs on tumor-specific T cells, focusing on their functional status. Utilizing a fully immunocompetent mouse model with a solid tumor expressing an immunogenic antigen, we showed that tumor-specific T cells acquire an exhausted phenotype and fail to expand under TCB treatment. By employing both mouse and human tumor-specific T cells in vitro, our study established that chronically stimulated tumor-specific T cells show impaired response to TCB treatment. The comparison of TCB efficacy in T cell-inflamed tumors with immunogenic antigens versus non-inflamed tumors with low antigen presence in mice revealed TCB success in solid tumors is more reliant on T cell functional fitness than on their abundance before treatment. The data also indicate that solid tumors with elevated levels of both, intratumoral regulatory T cells, and T cells expressing co-inhibitory receptors, show diminished responses to TCB therapy, aligning with similar observations described in hematological cancers. These findings highlight the critical role of T cell exhaustion due to chronic antigen exposure and illustrate that exhausted tumor-specific T cells are likely not the driver population redirected by TCBs for tumor elimination. Our research highlights the importance of maintaining T cell fitness and preventing T cell exhaustion to improve TCB therapy outcomes. This may help better identify patient populations with solid tumors that could benefit from TCB treatments most in clinical settings.">

A variety of highly immunogenic tuberculosis proteins have been used as targets in vaccine development to mitigate the spread of TB. Although Th1-type immunity has long been considered a crucial part of resistance to Mtb, γδ T cells, the predominant source of IL-17, are not negligible in controlling the early stages of TB infection. In addition to classical phosphoantigens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-resistant antigens (HAg), a complex containing 564 proteins obtained from live tuberculosis bacteria after heat treatment at 121 °C for 20 min, have been confirmed to be highly effective γδ T cell stimulators as well. Several studies have demonstrated that HAg-activated γδ T cells can participate in TB immunity by secreting multiple cytokines against Mtb or by interacting with other innate immune cells. In this review, we present a possible mechanism of HAg stimulation of γδ T cells and the role of HAg-activated γδ T cells in anti-TB immunity. We also highlight the limitations of studies on HAg activation of γδ T cells and suggest further research directions on the relationship between HAg and γδ T cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The occurrence of inflammation subsequent to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with an elevated risk of transplant‐related mortality (TRM). However, the duration of inflammation and the potential efficacy of anti‐inflammatory agents in reducing TRM remain uncertain. We performed a comprehensive investigation to examine the post‐transplantation alterations of inflammatory mediators and to ascertain the correlation between inflammation level and TRM through the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, ELISAs and cytometric bead array. The findings revealed that the 30‐day interval following transplantation is characterised by the most pronounced inflammatory response in both human and murine subjects, thereby elevating the risk of TRM. The inflammation is primarily caused by myeloid bias during haematopoietic reconstitution, which is a commonly overlooked aspect in clinical transplantation, additionally, a lesser extent of irradiation‐induced injury. The administration of the anti‐inflammatory agent resveratrol has the potential to reduce systemic inflammation and TRM by suppressing the NOD‐like receptor signalling pathway and slowing down granulocyte implantation in HSCT mice. This approach did not impair the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells. These findings demonstrate that the 30‐day post‐transplant period represents an opportunity to facilitate HSCT colonisation, mitigate transplant‐related adverse effects, and potentially reap the benefits of anti‐inflammatory treatments.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are generated in all cells. Systemic administration of allogenic EVs derived from epithelial and mesenchymal cells has been shown to be safe, despite carrying an array of functional molecules, including thousands of proteins. To address whether epithelial cell-derived EVs can be modified to acquire the capacity to induce an immune response, we engineered 293T EVs to harbor the immunomodulatory molecules CD80, OX40L, and PD-L1. We demonstrated abundant levels of these proteins in the engineered cells and EVs. Functionally, the engineered EVs efficiently elicited positive and negative costimulation of human and murine T cells. In the setting of cancer and autoimmune hepatitis, the engineered EVs modulated T cell functions and altered disease progression. OX40L EVs also provided enhanced antitumor activity in combination with anti-CTLA-4 in melanoma-bearing mice. In addition, we added multiple immunomodulatory proteins in EVs (EVmIM), attempting to elicit an immune response in both lymphoid and myeloid compartments. The EVmIM containing CD80, 4-1BBL, CD40L, CD2, and CD32 engaged both T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) in melanoma tumors, demonstrating the capacity for EVmIM to elicit antitumor activity. Our work provides evidence that EVs can be engineered to induce specific immune responses with translational potential to modulate immune cell functions in pathological settings.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Gut B cells maintain homeostasis by producing IgA antibodies that control the entry of commensal bacteria and pathogens. An increase in the number of B cells in the inflamed colon was detected in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Pro-inflammatory IgG antibodies binding to commensal bacteria are significantly elevated in UC, promoting intestinal inflammation. Aims To determine the effects of intestinal inflammation on the B cell compartment using a preclinical model of UC. Methods 32 CD-1 WT males were treated for 6 days with 2.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), followed by 8 days of recovery (regular water). Disease activity index was monitored daily. Distal colonic mRNA expression of cytokine (tumor necrosis [TNF-α], B-cell activating factor [Baff]) and factors associated with B cell attraction (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand [CXCL]13) were assessed by qRT-PCR. Localization using B cells phenotype (B220, cluster of differentiation (CD) 19, CD138, GL7, and IgD) and activation markers (CD80 & CD86) were assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF) in Peyers’ patches, distal colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Levels of IgA, M, G1, G2b, and G2c in colon tissue and serum were determined by ELISA. Results In colitic mice, TNF-α, Baff, and CXCL-13 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated, and immunostaining demonstrated several aggregated sites of B cells with the phenotype of B220+, IgD+, and CD19+in the lamina propria. Aggregated B cells were positive for co-expression of IgD and CD19 markers and negative for expression of IgA and IgG antibodies. Flow cytometry data showed a significant increase in the percentage of B220+ and CD19+ B cells within the CD45+ live cell population in colitic mice’s distal colon and MLNs. In addition, in colitic mice, the percentage of B cells expressing CD86 significantly increased in the distal colon, Peyers’ patches, and MLN. Furthermore, in colitic conditions, the percentage of B cells producing IgG1 was increased in the Peyers’ patches and distal part of the colon but only in Peyers’ patches for IgA-producing B cells. In colitic mice, IgA/IgG2c ratio in colon tissue decreased, and serum IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG1 antibody levels increased, with no difference for IgA and IgM. Conclusions Inflammatory conditions lead to B cell activation and recruitment with aggregated naïve B cells in the lamina propria that don’t switch to IgG or IgA. In colitis, systemic IgG subtypes increase, while Peyer’s patches may actively produce B cells expressing IgA or IgG1 during intestinal inflammation. These findings may guide the development of new UC therapies. Funding Agencies:">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor outcomes due to frequent recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. A major contributor to this resistance is the tumor’s ability to suppress natural killer (NK) cells, which are key players in the immune system’s fight against cancer. In PDAC, the tumor microenvironment (TME) creates conditions that impair NK cell function, including reduced proliferation, weakened cytotoxicity, and limited tumor infiltration. This review examines how interactions between tumor-derived factors, NK cells, and the TME contribute to tumor progression and treatment resistance. To address these challenges, we propose a new “Triple NK Cell Biomarker Approach”. This strategy focuses on identifying biomarkers from three critical areas: tumor characteristics, TME factors, and NK cell suppression mechanisms. This approach could guide personalized treatments to enhance NK cell activity. Additionally, we highlight the potential of combining NK cell-based therapies with conventional treatments and repurposed drugs to improve outcomes for PDAC patients. While progress has been made, more research is needed to better understand NK cell dysfunction and develop effective therapies to overcome these barriers.">

        <tr id="B cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays a central role in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas, making it a crucial therapeutic target. The advent of BCR-targeted inhibitors, particularly those directed at PI3K and BTK, has revolutionized treatment for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). However, therapeutic resistance remains a significant clinical challenge. Increasing evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, is crucial in driving cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. The BM microenvironment provides a specialized niche where lymphoma cells can evade therapy through interactions with stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) contribute significantly to this resistance. In this study, we developed an in vitro 3D model to better understand B cell lymphoma biology and drug resistance mechanisms. We co-cultured lymphoma cell lines with primary BMSCs in a 3D fibrin gel matrix using a high-throughput and automated system. Our results revealed that BMSCs modulate lymphoma cell growth and reduce their sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Furthermore, this model allowed us to identify IGFBP-3, Serpin E1, and PTX-3 as potential mediators of therapeutic resistance. These findings underscore the value of using 3D co-culture models in preclinical settings to more accurately study drug resistance, as they more closely simulate the BM microenvironment’s complexity than traditional 2D models, thus improving the predictive value of drug testing in B cell lymphomas.

        <tr id="Abstract Ovarian cancer (OC) remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to its late-stage diagnosis and high recurrence rates. Chronic inflammation is a critical driver of OC progression, contributing to immune evasion, tumor growth, and metastasis. Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, as well as key signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), are upregulated in OC, promoting a tumor-promoting environment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by immune cells like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion. Furthermore, OC cells utilize immune checkpoint pathways, including PD-1/PD-L1, to inhibit cytotoxic T cell activity. Targeting these inflammatory and immune evasion mechanisms offers promising therapeutic strategies. COX-2 inhibitors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway blockers, and NF-kB inhibitors have shown potential in preclinical studies, while immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have been explored with mixed results in OC. Additionally, emerging research on the microbiome and inflammation-related biomarkers, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and exosomes, points to new opportunities for early detection and precision medicine. Future approaches to OC treatment must focus on personalized strategies that target the inflammatory TME, integrating anti-inflammatory therapies with immunotherapy to enhance patient outcomes. Continued research into the interplay between inflammation and immune evasion in OC is essential for developing effective, long-lasting treatments.">

        <tr id="Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia remains a major contributor to clinical complications in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, including organ injury, morbidity and mortality. Given their critical role in antiviral defense, CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against CMV.Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional signatures and developmental lineages of CD8+ T cells in eight immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received organs from CMV-seropositive donors. Results were validated in a cohort of 62 KTRs using immunophenotyping.Our data revealed a significant influence of CMV serostatus on transcriptional variance of CD8+ memory T cells, associating with the first principal component from a global analysis of CD8+ T cells (p =0.0406), forming a continuum with five principal differentiation trajectories driven by CMV primary infection or reactivation. Following CMV primary infection, CD8+ T cells were hallmarked by restrained effector-memory differentiation. CD8+ T cells during CMV reactivation diverged non-linearly into senescent-like cells with signatures of arrested cell cycle, diminished translational activity and downregulated ZNF683 and longitudinally expanding effector cells with robust cytotoxic potential and upregulated ZNF683, acting as a reservoir for long-lived effector cells supporting long-term protection. Notably, CD28lo KLRG1hi IL-7R (CD127)lo HLA-DRhi CD8+ T cells present prior to the detection of viremia in CMV-seropositive patients emerged as a key feature distinguishing patients who did or did not undergo CMV reactivation after prophylaxis discontinuation (p =0.0163). Frequencies of these cells were also positively correlated with CMV-stimulated secretion of IFN-γ (p =0.0494), TNF-α (p =0.0358), MIP-1α (p =0.0262), MIP-1β (p =0.0043).These results provide insights into the transcriptional regulation that influences the generation of CD8+ T cell immunity to CMV and may inform strategics for monitoring host immune response to CMV to better identify and introduce therapeutic intervention to patients at risk of developing clinically significant CMV viremia.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether T-bet+ B cells, as well as age-associated B cells/ABCs (CD19+CD21-CD11c+T-bet+) and double-negative B cells/DN (CD19+IgD-CD27- CXCR5-T-bet+), serve as prognostic and/or therapeutic tools for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans.


METHODS
Flow cytometry was used for enumerating T-bet+ B cells and ABCs/DN subsets, found in the peripheral blood of 10 healthy donors and 22 active SLE patients. Whole blood assay cultures, combined with in vitro pharmacological treatments, were performed to evaluate the effects of hydroxychloroquine, anifrolumab and fasudil (a ROCK kinase inhibitor) on T-bet+ B cells' percentage. Moreover, previously published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were used in a meta-analysis to allow characterization of genes and pathways associated with the biology of T-bet in B cells.


RESULTS
T-bet+ B cells displayed an expansion in SLE patients [1.47 (1.9 - 0.7) vs 10.85 (37.4 - 3.6)]. Similarly, both ABCs and DN were found to be expanded. Interestingly, percentages of T-bet+ B cells positively correlated with patients' SLEDAI scores (rs=0.55, p=0.007). Cell culture experiments conducted, revealed that all three agents tested can deplete T-bet+ B cells (without affecting the cell viability of lymphocytes, T cells and B cells). According to bioinformatics analyses, T-bet is highly expressed in two B cell clusters with pathogenic characteristics for SLE (designated as atypical memory B cells and activated naïve B cells). These clusters can be targeted for therapeutic interventions.


CONCLUSIONS
T-bet+ B cells can serve as a putative prognostic biomarker of lupus severity. Circumstantial data suggest that these cells may promote disease pathogenesis and may represent a novel therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy involves significant immunological changes to support fetal development while protecting the mother from infections. A growing body of evidence supports the importance of immune checkpoint pathways, especially at the maternal–fetal interface, although limited information is available about the peripheral expression of these molecules by CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets during the trimesters of pregnancy. Understanding the dynamics of these immune cells and their checkpoint pathways is crucial for elucidating their roles in pregnancy maintenance and potential complications. This study aims to investigate the peripheral expression and functional characteristics of CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets throughout pregnancy, providing insights into their contributions to maternal and fetal health. A total of 34 healthy women were enrolled from the first, 30 from the second and 40 from the third trimester of pregnancy. At the same time, 35 healthy age-matched non-pregnant women formed the control group. From peripheral blood, mononuclear cells were separated and stored at −80 °C. CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets were analyzed from freshly thawed samples, and surface and intracellular staining was performed using flow cytometric analyses. The proportions of CD56+ NK cells in peripheral blood were similar across groups. While CD8− NKdim cells increased significantly in all trimesters compared to non-pregnant controls, CD8+ NKdim cells showed no significant changes. CD8− NKbright cells had higher frequencies throughout pregnancy, whereas CD8+ NKbright cells significantly increased only in the first and second trimesters. The expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and PD-L1, and cytotoxic-activity-related molecules were stable, with notable perforin and granzyme B increases in CD8− NKbright cells throughout pregnancy. Our study shows that peripheral NK cell populations, especially CD8− subsets, are predominant during pregnancy. This shift suggests a crucial role for CD8− NK cells in balancing maternal immune tolerance and surveillance. The stable expression of immune checkpoint molecules indicates that other regulatory mechanisms may be at work. These findings enhance our understanding of peripheral immune dynamics in pregnancy and suggest that targeting CD8− NKbright cell functions could help manage pregnancy-related immune complications. This research elucidates the stable distribution and functional characteristics of peripheral NK cells during pregnancy, with CD8− subsets being more prevalent. The increased activity of CD8− NKbright cells suggests their critical role in maintaining immune surveillance. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to uncover the mechanisms regulating NK cell function in pregnancy, potentially leading to new treatments for immune-related pregnancy complications.">

        <tr id="During tumor immunosurveillance, leukocytes play a crucial role in the cellular defense system, working collaboratively with other immune components to recognize and eliminate aberrant cells. Integral to this process is the integrin Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen 1 (LFA-1). LFA-1 facilitates adhesion during leukocyte migration and helps establish stable cell-to-cell contacts between leukocytes and their targets. Additionally, as a receptor, LFA-1 signaling activates leukocytes, promoting their differentiation and effector functions against cancer. However, tumors can develop mechanisms to evade immune clearance by disrupting LFA-1 functions or hijacking its pathways. In this review, we first detail how leukocytes utilize LFA-1 during immunosurveillance and then explore how tumors counteract this process in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by either altering LFA-1 functions or exploiting it to drive tumorigenesis. Moreover, we discuss therapeutic strategies targeting LFA-1, including inhibitors tested in laboratory studies and animal models, highlighting their potential as anticancer interventions and the need for further research to evaluate their clinical utility.">

        <tr id="The application of biological therapy and glucocorticoids in Auto-immune diseases (AID) patients will cause immunocompromised host (ICH) prone to infection. And monocytes play a key role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. We aimed to investigate the changes of circulating monocyte subsets in AID or AID-ICH patients with pulmonary infection. The subgroups and PD-L1 expression of monocytes were measured by flow cytometry in healthy individuals (HC), new-onset AID patients (AID cohort) and AID-ICH patients with pulmonary opportunistic infection (AID-ICH cohort). Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the distribution of monocyte subsets, including classical monocytes (CL, CD14++CD16−), intermediate monocytes (ITM, CD14++CD16+) and non-classical monocytes (NC, CD14+/−CD16++), as well as the dynamic change of PD-L1 + cluster among monocyte subsets. Among total monocyte, AID-ICH displayed decreased CL subset along with increased NC subset compared to HCs and AID. Regarding PD-L1 + monocytes, although CL subset constituted the majority of that in HCs, AIDs and AID-ICHs, imbalance of NC/CL within PD-L1 + monocytes was only noticed in AID-ICHs (P < 0.05). Furthermore, when AID subjects were developed into immunocompromised status (ICH), PD-L1 + cluster in CL was minorly decreased (P > 0.05). Clinically, the lower ratio of PD-L1 + cluster among CL subset (P < 0.05) and the less differentiated CL in PD-L1 + monocytes (P < 0.05) was more likely to leaded to disease progression. The imbalance of circulating NC/CL subset was remarkable in immunocompromised host with pulmonary opportunistic infection, especially involvement of PD-L1+ cluster, which served as a potential biomarker in clinical practice.">

 Background:
 Recent studies indicate that the efficacy of chemotherapy is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment. Peritoneal cavity contains many immune cells, however, the relationship between immune response within the peritoneal cavity and tumor response remains poorly understood.
 Methods:
 Single cell suspensions were obtained from ascites or peritoneal lavages from 41 patients with PM from GC. In 28 patients, cells were collected both before and after 1-3 courses of IP chemotherapy. These samples were immunestained with mAbs targeting to specific lymphoid or myeloid subsets, and their proportions in CD45(+) leukocytes were analyzed using flowcytometry. Eosinophils were purified by magnetic cell sorting for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.
 Results:
 Among 41 patients with PM, tumor leukocyte ratio (TLR) calculated as CD326(+) tumor cells divided by CD45(+) leukocytes varied from 0.002% to 58.1%. TLR was not correlated with any ratios of immune cells, however, the ratios of CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and CD16(-) CD193(+) eosinophils tended to decrease with the increase in TLR. Conversely, the ratios of CD19(+) B cell, CD14(+) macrophages and CD16(+) neutrophils increased with elevated TLR. Mean survival time of these patients was 17.7 months. None of the leukocyte subsets showed significant association with patient outcome. In 28 patients, the ratios of lymphocytes mostly decreased with significant difference in CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells after IP treatment. In contrast, the ratio of CD11b(+) myeloid cells increased in peritoneal cavity after IP treatment. Among the myeloid cells, the ratio of CD16(-) CD193(+) eosinophils significantly increased. The change was particularly prominent in in post-treatment negative peritoneal lavage cytology (CY0) patients (M=0.47% vs M=10.0%, p<0.0001), while the difference was not significant in post-treatment positive peritoneal lavage cytology (CY1) patients (M=0.93% vs M=0.97%, p=0.84). Patients with eosinophil ratio of ≥2% after IP chemotherapy in peritoneal cavity had significantly longer overall survival compared to those with lower eosinophil ratios (17.3 mo vs 26.7 mo, p=0.034; HR =0.23[0.06-0.89]). The peritoneal eosinophils after IP treatment exhibited elevated levels of CD11b and CD63 expression compared to circulating eosinophils (p<0.01), while SSC-A levels tended to be lower. Gene ontology pathways revealed enrichment of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, extracellular matrix organization and response to interferon-gamma in peritoneal eosinophils (p<0.0001).
 Conclusions:
 IP-PTX induces eosinophil activation and recruitment in the peritoneal cavity, while also affecting other types of immune cells. These effects may potentially contribute to the anti-tumor response against peritoneal metastases.

        <tr id="Cancer remains a major challenge to global public health, with rising incidence and high mortality rates. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex system of immune cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix (ECM), and blood vessels that form a space conducive to cancer cell proliferation. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are abundant in tumors, and they drive immunosuppression through metabolic reprogramming in the TME. This review describes how metabolic pathways such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and adenosine metabolism have a significant impact on the function of MDSCs by regulating their immunosuppressive activity and promoting their survival and expansion in tumors. The review also explores key metabolic targets in MDSCs and strategies to modulate MDSC metabolism to improve the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding these pathways can provide insight into potential therapeutic targets for modulating MDSC activity and improving outcomes of cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
The progress made in cancer immunology has led to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. However, despite these advances, the superficial characteristics of immune cells have been frequently overlooked: This oversight may be attributed to a limited understanding of the intricate relationships between immune cells and their microenvironment. This study seeks to address this limitation by comprehensively examining cell size and granularity in breast cancer (BC) patients and healthy donors (HD).


METHODS
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were isolated from BC patients and HD. We examined the size (FSC-A%rCV) and granularity (SSC-A%rCV) of immune cell subsets in both patient groups and HD using flowcytometry.


RESULTS
Despite the absence of statistically significant variations in cell size between BC and HD, visual examination reveals noticeable discrepancies. There is a substantial decrease in granularity in CD8 and CD4 T-cell populations in BC compared to HD which is not observed in B cells.


CONCLUSION
Our analysis shows that while the size of immune cells may not be significantly altered in breast cancer patients compared to healthy donors, a closer examination of cell granularity reveals a distinct pattern. Specifically, the T-cell populations, including CD8 and CD4 cells, exhibit a substantial decrease in granularity in BC compared to HD. In contrast, B cells remain unaffected, suggesting that the granularity of T cells is uniquely susceptible to perturbations in breast cancer. This observation highlights the importance of considering cell granularity as a critical aspect of immune cell function, particularly in the context of cancer development.">

        <tr id="Brain metastasis (BM) is a poor prognostic factor in cancer patients. Despite showing efficacy in many extracranial tumors, immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-CTLA-4 mAb appears to be less effective against intracranial tumors. Promisingly, recent clinical studies have reported that combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs has a potent antitumor effect on BM, highlighting the need to elucidate the detailed mechanisms controlling the intracranial tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we analyzed the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in murine models of BM that responded to anti-CTLA-4 mAb to anti-PD-1 mAb. Activated CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells with high CTLA-4 expression characteristically infiltrated the intracranial TME, which were activated by the combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatment. Loss of TFH cells suppressed the additive effect of CTLA-4 blockade on anti-PD-1 mAb. B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) produced by abundant myeloid cells, particularly CD80hiCD206lo pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages, in the intracranial TME, induced B cell and TFH cell infiltration and activation. Furthermore, the intracranial TME of patients with non-small cell lung cancer featured TFH and B cell infiltration as tertiary lymphoid structures. Together, these findings provide insights into the immune cell crosstalk in the intracranial TME that facilitates an additive anti-tumor effect of CTLA-4 blockade with anti-PD-1 treatment, supporting the potential of a combination immunotherapeutic strategy for BM.">

        <tr id="Although significant progress has been made in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, its overall efficacy remains limited in a large number of patients. The interaction between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and CD8+ T cells is one of the core topics in cancer immunotherapy research. CD8+ T cells can play an anti-tumor role by recognizing and killing virus-infected or mutated cells. However, in the TME, as the tumor compresses immune cells, the function of them is impaired, and studies have found that relying on PD-1 alone is not enough to resist tumor cells. Therefore, by blocking the PD-1 and Tim-3 pathways to interfere with CD8+ T cell exhaustion (TEX), the performance of CD8+ T cells can be maximized, their survival period extended, and the efficacy of positive cancer immunotherapy improved. For patients with cancer who have failed to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy, multi-targeted combination therapy may achieve better results.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells crucial for fighting infections, exhibit both tumor-promoting and tumor-inhibiting roles in cancer. This dual behavior depends on the environment around the tumor and includes remodeling the extracellular matrix, fostering angiogenesis, inducing cancer cell death, and enhancing immune responses. A notable yet underexplored phenomenon is the engulfment of neutrophils by cancer cells, potentially mediated by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). This process raises critical questions about its role in either aiding immune evasion or triggering cancer cell death through mechanisms such as ferroptosis. This review delves into neutrophil biology, their complex roles in cancer, the impact of LAP on neutrophil engulfment, and the therapeutic implications of modulating this pathway. Additionally, it highlights the potential of neutrophils as delivery systems for cancer therapies, underscoring the need to unravel tumor-associated neutrophil functions and LAP mechanisms to inform novel and effective cancer treatments.">

Here, we generated TAK-500, an immune cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC), to deliver a STING agonist to CCR2+ human cells and drive enhanced antitumor activity relative to non-targeted STING agonists. Preclinically, TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent innate immune activation in vitro. In addition, a murine TAK-500 iADC surrogate enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses both in vitro and in murine tumor models. Spatially resolved analysis of CCR2 and immune cell markers in the TME of >1,000 primary human tumors showed the CCR2 protein was predominantly expressed in intratumoral myeloid cells.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Arginase-1 (Arg1) expressing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is a significant challenge for cancer immunotherapy. We previously reported the existence of Arg1-specific memory T cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and described that Arg-1-based immune modulatory vaccines (IMVs) control tumor growth and alter the M1/M2 macrophage ratio in murine models of cancer. In the present study, we investigated how Arg1-specific T cells can directly target TAMs and influence their polarization. Methods Murine Arg1-specific CD4+T cells isolated from splenocytes of animals vaccinated with an Arg1-derived peptide in the adjuvant montanide were co-cultured with either in vitro M2-differentiated bone marrow-derived macrophages or ex vivo isolated F4/80+TAMs. Human Arg1-specific CD4+T cell clones were co-cultured with Arg1-expressing TAMs generated in vitro from either PBMC-derived CD14+cells or the myeloid cell lines MonoMac1 and THP-1. MHC class II-restricted Arg-1 peptide presentation by macrophages was confirmed by immunopeptidomics. T-cell-mediated changes in the macrophage immune phenotype and cytokine microenvironment were examined using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and multiplex immunoassay. The effect of Arg1-derived peptide IMV on TAMs in vivo was assessed by multiplex gene analysis of F4/80+cells. Results We show that Arg1-based IMV-mediated tumor control was linked to a decrease in multiple immunosuppressive pathways in the TAM population of the treated animals. Tumor-conditioned media (TCM) derived from Arg1-vaccinated mice induced significantly higher upregulation of MHC-II on exposed myeloid cells compared with controls. Furthermore, murine CD4+Arg1-specific T cells were able to target TAMs and effectively reprogram their phenotype ex vivo by secreting IL2 and IFNγ. Next, we established that human Arg1+TAMs present Arg1-derived peptides and are directly recognized by proinflammatory CD4+Arg1-specific T cell clones. These CD4+Arg1-specific T cells were able to reprogram TCM-conditioned macrophages as observed by increased expression of CD80 and HLA-DR. Conclusions TAMs may be directly targeted and modulated by Arg1-specific CD4+T cells. These findings provide a strong rationale for future clinical development of Arg1-based IMVs to alter the immune-suppressive TME by reprogramming TAMs and promoting a proinflammatory TME.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent a challenge in developing an effective and safe therapy for HCC. TAMs are considered to be one of the major mechanisms for HCC resistance to current therapies. TAMs, known as M1-like and M2-like macrophages, were discovered to be subdivided into four subsets (M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d). Each subset has a hypothetical contribution as a TAM immunosuppressive cell. Several trials have studied removing or modulating the immune suppressive roles of TAMs in the HCC microenvironment. Identifying TAMs’ behavior and subsets may be crucial for modulating the immune suppression in the HCC microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are gaining recognition as promising therapeutic carriers for immune modulation. We investigated the potential of EVs derived from HEK293FT cells to stabilize and deliver interleukin-10 (IL-10), a key anti-inflammatory cytokine. Using minicircle (MC) DNA vectors, we achieved IL-10 overexpression and efficient incorporation into EVs, yielding superior stability compared to free, recombinant IL-10 protein. Detailed biophysical and functional analyses revealed that IL-10+ EVs contain both monomeric and oligomeric forms of IL-10 on their external surface and encapsulated within vesicles. IL-10+ EVs suppressed inflammatory cytokine expression in pro-inflammatory macrophages (from two to 14-fold compared to naïve EVs) without inducing anti-inflammatory polarization, demonstrating a distinct immunosuppressive mechanism. Interestingly, naïve EVs from non-transfected cells also exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting that the intrinsic bioactive cargo of EVs substantially contributes to their function, complicating the interpretation of IL-10-specific effects. Size-based fractionation analyses of IL-10+ large EVs (lEVs), small EVs (sEVs), and non-vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs) revealed IL-10 presence across all fractions, predominantly in monomeric form, with anti-inflammatory activity distributed among subpopulations. Anion exchange chromatography successfully enriched IL-10+ exosomes while retaining immunomodulatory effects. However, the shared properties of naïve and IL-10+ exosomes underscore the complexity of their immunomodulatory functions. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of EVs while emphasizing the need to disentangle the contributions of engineered cytokines from endogenous vesicular components.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background There is a need for noninvasive immunological biomarkers that can identify stable kidney allograft immune quiescence to inform individualized immunosuppression. Methods We conducted a cross‐sectional, pilot cohort study evaluating the relative abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector T‐cell (Teff) populations as a surrogate marker of long‐term graft tolerance. We obtained fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients, most with recent surveillance biopsies to identify the presence or absence of chronic inflammation. Tregs were sub‐phenotyped as naïve, memory, and activated Tregs (aTreg). Treg/Teff ratios were modeled for association with chronic inflammation and in the context of potential clinical features. Results Twenty‐seven patient samples were included on standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 5.0 years, at 30.2 ± 21.7 months posttransplant. The ratio of aTreg (FOXP3++CD45RA−) to Th17 cells (CD4+IL‐17+) was significantly greater in patients without inflammation than in patients with graft inflammation (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater aTreg/CD4+ T cells and aTreg/CD8+ Teff in patients without inflammation (p = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). There was no significant association for inflammation with naïve or memory Treg/Teff ratios. Multiple logistic regression with all three aTreg/Teff ratios modeled allograft inflammation with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–0.98). Conclusions The proportion of peripheral blood aTregs/Teff cells in this pilot cohort of stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients was associated with immune quiescence. These data support further investigation into aTreg/Teff monitoring to inform precision immunosuppressive treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) confer ferroptosis resistance and CD8(+) T cell inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). By the intravenous injection of LLC cells into the tail vein, a LUAD mouse model was created. Phorbol‐12‐myristate‐13‐acetate (PMA) stimulated neutrophils to facilitate NETs formation and combined with NETs inhibitor DNase I to explore NETs mechanism on LLC cell proliferation, migration, ferroptosis resistance, and CD8(+) T cell activity. CitH3, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cell‐free DNA, and MPO‐DNA levels in LUAD were increased, indicating an increase in NETs formation in LUAD. PMA promoted NETs formation in tumours of mice, increased the number of CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells, decreased perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B, IFNγ, and TNF‐α levels, and promoted LUAD growth and the number of lung tumour nodules, indicating that PMA promoted NETs formation, reduced the activity of CD8(+)T cells, and promoted LUAD growth. DNase I partially reversed the effects of PMA. NETs promoted LLC cell proliferation and migration, while DNase I reversed NETs effects. Erastin inhibited LLC cell proliferation and migration and promoted ferroptosis. NETs partially reversed Erastin effects. Further results showed that NETs promoted LLC cell proliferation and migration and inhibited ferroptosis by promoting YTHDF2‐mediated SLC2A3 mRNA degradation. Sh‐YTHDF2 partially reversed the effect of NETs on LLC cells, whereas si‐SLC2A3 partially reversed sh‐YTHDF2 effects on LLC cells. In addition, NETs inhibited LLC cell ferroptosis by inhibiting CD8(+) T cell activity. Sh‐YTHDF2 and DNase I inhibited NETs formation in tumours, increased the activity of CD8(+) T cells and inhibited LUAD growth. Our results suggested that NETs promoted the growth of LUAD through inhibiting ferroptosis and CD8(+) T cell activity by promoting YTHDF2‐mediated SLC2A3 mRNA degradation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The monkeypox (MPXV) outbreak in 2022 is more prevalent among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While it is plausible that HIV-induced immunosuppression could result in a more severe progression, the exact mechanisms remain undetermined. To better understand the immunopathology of MPXV in patients with and without HIV infection, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from six patients hospitalized for MPXV, three of whom had HIV infection (HIV antibody positive and HIV RNA level below the detection limit), and three patients only infected with MPXV (HIV-). We map the peripheral immune response in both the acute phase and the recovery period, showing the reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotypes in acute stage compared with recovery stage, characterized by disturbed cell subsets and intense cell interactions mediated by monocytes and neutrophils. Importantly, we also found obviously dysregulated gene expression and cell subsets in HIV+ patients proposing mechanism underlying their serious condition. Our findings provide a comprehensive cell atlas of MPXV patients, shed light on the mechanisms underlying the severe disease progression and longer recovery time in HIV+ individuals.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized immune cells that play a crucial role in presenting antigens and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to combat tumors. The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) can bind to its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This interaction suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Radiation therapy can increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, and detailed studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. As many patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy-either through lack of response or cancer recurrence-there is a critical need to maximize synergistic effects by selecting combination treatments that offer improved therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects. In the present study, immature DCs (iDCs) were introduced directly into irradiated tumor sites (referred as IR/iDCs), and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) were administered intraperitoneally. We confirmed the antitumor effect of combining IR/iDCs and ICBs by examining tumor growth and mouse survival. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes increased in the IR/iDCs-treated groups. Combining IR/iDCs with an anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a significant reduction in distant tumor growth and improved mouse survival rates compared with IR/iDCs alone or IR/iDCs + anti-PD-1 antibody. These findings suggest that integrating radiotherapy, DC-based immunotherapy, and ICB, specifically targeting PD-L1, may be an effective cancer treatment strategy.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, a subset of T cells identified by the surface glycoprotein CD8, particularly those expressing the co-stimulatory molecule CD226, play a crucial role in the immune response to malignancies. However, their role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an immunosuppressive disease, has not yet been explored. We studied 64 CLL patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the proportion of CD226-expressing cells among different CD8+ T cell subsets (including naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effectors) in CLL patients, stratified by Rai stage and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutation status. Additionally, we compared the effector functions of CD8+CD226+ cells and their CD226- counterparts. We also quantified cytokine and chemokine levels in the plasma of CLL and HCs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed the publicly available bulk RNA-seq on CD226+ and CD226-CD8+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated the impact of elevated cytokines/chemokines on CD226 expression. Our results showed that CD226-expressing cells were significantly decreased within the effector memory and effector CD8+ T cell subsets in CLL patients with advanced Rai stages and unmutated IgHV, a marker of poor prognosis. These cells displayed robust effector functions, including cytokine production, cytolytic activity, degranulation, proliferation, and migration capacity. In contrast, CD8+CD226- T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype with reduced Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) were inversely correlated with the frequency of CD8+CD226+ T cells and may contribute to the downregulation of CD226, possibly leading to T cell dysfunction in CLL. Our findings highlight the critical role of CD8+CD226+RUNX2hi T cells in CLL and suggest that their reduction is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. This study also underscores the potential of targeting IL-6 and MIP-1β to preserve polyfunctional CD8+CD226+ T cells as a promising immunotherapy strategy.">

However, the impact of anti-PD-1 therapy on host humoral immunity in humans during cancer immunotherapy requires further investigation. Methods We evaluated immunoglobulin titers by ELISA and screened the immune landscape of immune cells from 25 healthy donors and 50 cases including 25 new-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients prior to systemic treatment and 25 HCC patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy by multicolor flow cytometry. Flow or beads sorted cells were cultured ex vivo for proliferation and functional analysis. Results Anti-PD-1 therapy significantly increased the levels of IgG and IgA in the periphery of HCC patients. Anti-PD-1 treatment led to an increase in plasmablasts and a notable rise in circulating T follicular regulatory (cTfr) cells, while changes in circulating B cells, T follicular helper cells, or regulatory T cells were not significant. Anti-PD-1 therapy also influenced the proliferation and function of cTfr cells, promoting the differentiation of CD38+ cTfr cells. We observed that the CD38+ Tfr cell subset in the peripheral blood can promote plasmablast differentiation, associated with altered antibody production. Conclusions Together, these data demonstrate the immunomodulatory role of PD-1 in restricting the differentiation and function of human cTfr cells and in regulating humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Patients who have ovarian tumors infiltrated with high frequencies of T cells are associated with a greater survival probability. However, therapies to revitalize tumor-associated T cells, such as PD-L1/PD-1 or CTLA4 blockade, are ineffective for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that for ovarian cancer, Toll-Like Receptor 5 (TLR5) signaling, for which the only known ligand is bacterial flagellin, governed failure of PD-L1 and CTLA4 blockade. Mechanistically, chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells in vivo and in vitro impaired the differentiation of functional IL-12-producing XCR1+CD103+ conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), biasing CD11c+ precursor cells toward myeloid subsets expressing high levels of PD-L1. This culminated in impaired activation of CD8+ T cells, reducing CD8+ T-cell function and ability to persist within the ovarian tumor microenvironment. Expansion of cDC1s in situ using FLT3L in combination with PD-L1 blockade achieved significant survival benefit in TLR5 knockout mice bearing ovarian tumors, whereas no benefit was observed in the presence of TLR5 signaling. Thus, we have identified a host-intrinsic mechanism leading to the failure of PD-L1 blockade for ovarian cancer, demonstrating that chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells is a barrier limiting the efficacy of checkpoint therapy.">

We evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, specifically focusing on TLS, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor concentration dosage in the TME and spatial interaction analyses. We found that TLS presence was associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation was associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and proximity of activated conventional type 2 DCs (DC2) to CD8+ T cells, indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associated TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density with improved progression-free survival, substantiating TLS presence as a potential prognostic marker. Our results provide evidence that TLS presence denotes cell activation and immunotherapy target expression.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) are the first line of treatment for many solid tumors including melanoma. PD-1 blockade enhances the effector functions of melanoma-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, leading to durable tumor remissions. However, 55% of patients with melanoma do not respond to treatment. As Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells play an important role in tumor-induced immunosuppression and express PD-1, we hypothesized that anti-PD-1 also increases the functions of melanoma-infiltrating Treg cells, which could be detrimental to treatment efficacy. Methods The cellular and functional dynamics of Treg cells were evaluated in C57Bl/6 Foxp3-reporter mice bearing highly immunogenic and PD-1 blockade-sensitive Yale University Mouse Melanoma Exposed to Radiation 1.7 (YUMMER1.7) tumors. Treg cell responses in tumors and lymphoid compartments were examined throughout tumor growth or therapy and were assessed ex vivo by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis, with in vitro suppression assays using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and in situ through spatial proteomic and transcriptomic profiling. Results In this highly immunogenic melanoma model, anti-PD-1 monotherapy yielded high responders (HRs) and low responders (LRs). We show that the potent CD8+ T cell responses characteristic of HR tumors paradoxically coincide with the expansion of highly-activated, Helios-expressing Treg cells. In both HRs and LRs, Treg cells co-localize with CD8+ T cells in immunogenic regions of the tumor and display potent suppressive capacity in vitro. Further characterization revealed that melanoma-infiltrating Treg cells progressively acquire T-bet and interferon gamma expression, exclusively in HRs, and induction of this T helper cell 1 (Th1)-like phenotype in vitro led to CD8+ T cell evasion from Treg cell-mediated suppression. Using spatial proteomic and transcriptomic profiling, we demonstrate that Treg cells display an increased activity of PI3K/Akt signaling in regions of HR tumors with an elevated CD8:Treg cell ratio. Conclusions PD-1 blockade promotes the expansion of a subset of highly-activated Treg cells coexpressing PD-1 and Helios. While these cells are potently suppressive outside tumor environments, costimulatory and inflammatory signals present in the tumor microenvironment lead to their local acquisition of Th1-like characteristics and loss of suppression of effector T cells.">

B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is a heterogenous group of aggressive and indolent malignancies with significant therapeutic challenges due to high relapse rates and limited options for relapsed/refractory disease. BsAbs function by simultaneously binding to CD3 on endogenous T-cells and a tumor-associated antigen, creating an immunologic synapse which results in the death of the target cell.

 Microbiota-specific CD4+ T cells drive chronic inflammation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), comprising Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). In previous projects we have identified several CD4+ T cell subsets enriched in the inflamed mucosa from naïve IBD patients, especially a colon-specific increase of HLA-DR+CD38+CD4+ memory T cells1. However, the functional properties remained to be elucidated. We therefore aimed to characterize CD4+ helper T cell lineage-specifying transcription factor (TF) expression and cytokine profiles in mucosa and circulation from IBD patients.



 We collected intestinal samples and peripheral blood from patients and healthy controls undergoing diagnostic ileocolonoscopy, and subsequently employed 5-laser spectral flow cytometry to analyse single-cell data.



 For phenotypic characterization, a 37-antibody panel including TF and chemokine receptors was applied to 70 intestinal samples from 16 CD and 12 UC patients (including 22 non-inflamed, 22 inflamed samples and 16 samples in remission), as well as 5 healthy controls. Unbiased tSNE-based analysis revealed an increase of Foxp3+ Treg cells in inflamed biopsies. Particularly, in Ki-67+RORγt+ cells, we identified a cluster co-expressing Foxp3 and Helios, and a cluster expressed T-bet were enriched in inflamed colonic biopsies. As described before, two clusters of activated RORγt+HLA-DR+CD38+ T cell subset, one CD103+ and another CD103-, were increased in frequency in inflamed biopsies. Both clusters expressed CTLA-4, CD39 and Ki-67. In contrast, the frequencies of RORγt+ NKT-like cells (CD161+CD69+CD103-) were decreased in inflamed tissues.
 Next, we measured cytokine production in CD4+ T intestinal cells upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of non-inflamed (healthy controls=8, IBD in active stage=8, IBD in remission=4) and inflamed samples (IBD in active stage=7). Frequencies of multifunctional CD103+ and CD103- CD154+ cells simultaneously producing IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2 were decreased in inflamed biopsies. On the contrary, CXCL-13 expression was elevated in the inflamed group.



 In conclusion, we observed that a Th17/Treg and a Th17/Th1 subset were increased in inflamed biopsies, which we hypothesize to represent a transformation of Th17 to Treg or Th1. In addition, the HLA-DR+CD38+ subset displaying a Th17 profile was proliferating in inflamed mucosa, indicative of an active role in the disease pathogenesis. Simultaneously, Tregs were upregulated while CD4+ T cells produced less cytokines in inflamed mucosa, potentially indicating that Treg cells suppress the pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response in IBD patients. Thus, our results provide new clues about the functional contribution of CD4+ T cells to inflammation in IBD.

Cirrhosis, an advanced stage of liver diseases, induces Cirrhosis-Associated Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CAIDS) characterized by both innate and adaptive immune dysfunction. Inflammation triggered by factors such as alcohol, viruses, toxins, and cholesterol induce metabolic reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Our study specifically sought to investigate the compromised adaptive immune response in cirrhosis by focusing on assessing T-cell exhaustion and activation markers on helper and cytotoxic T cells.


METHOD
A prospective observational study involving 19 liver cirrhosis patients and 36 healthy controls was conducted. Hepatic decompensation degree was assessed using various parameters including serum bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. T cell activation (CD38, CD44, CD69, HLADR), and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) were assessed on helper and cytotoxic T cells by flow cytometry.


RESULT
Cirrhosis patients showed reduced T cells with no alteration in CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. Among activation markers, HLADR showed increased expression on CD8+ T cells (P=0.031). Regarding exhaustion markers LAG-3 and TIM-3 exhibited increased expression in cirrhotic patients compared to controls in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (P=0.004, P=0.016, P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively). Neither cirrhotic nor healthy controls showed CTLA expression. PD-1 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Co-expression of PD-1/TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells was notably higher in cirrhotic patients (P<0.002).


CONCLUSION
The observation of impaired adaptive immunity with notable T cell exhaustion and activation in cirrhosis underscores the potential relevance of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by its ability to evade the immune system, hindering the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Recent research has highlighted the important role of immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in driving this immune evasion. In this study, we are the first to identify THEMIS2 as a key regulator of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated immunosuppression in GBM. We found that a high THEMIS2 expression is associated with poor patient outcomes and increased infiltration of immune cells, particularly macrophages. Functional analyses revealed THEMIS2’s critical involvement in immune-related pathways, including immune response activation, mononuclear cell differentiation, and the positive regulation of cytokine production. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated that macrophages with a high THEMIS2 expression were associated with increased phagocytosis, immune suppression, and enhanced tumor growth. These findings suggest that THEMIS2 could serve as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in GBM.">

Peritoneal fibrosis is a serious complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) and abdominal surgeries, yet effective treatments remain elusive. Given the known roles of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in immune responses and fibrotic diseases, we investigated their involvement in PD-induced peritoneal fibrosis to identify potential therapeutic targets.


METHODS
We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to characterize the activation and function of peritoneal MAIT cells in patients undergoing long-term PD. Our investigation focused on the molecular pathways activated by these cells, particularly the MHC class I-related protein 1 (MR1)-mediated interaction with mesothelial cells and subsequent activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. We further assessed the impact of inhibiting MAIT cells on fibrogenesis using both in vitro models and Mr1 knockout mice.


RESULTS
Our study revealed that long-term PD significantly enhanced the activation of MAIT cells, particularly the pro-inflammatory MAIT17 subtype. These activated cells contributed to peritoneal fibrogenesis by binding to the MR1 receptor on mesothelial cells, which triggered hyperglycolysis through the mTORC1 pathway, ultimately leading to fibrogenesis. Notably, we demonstrated that blocking the MR1-MAIT interaction, either through genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition with acetyl-6-formylpterin (Ac-6-FP), effectively mitigated fibrosis.


CONCLUSIONS
This study identified MAIT cells as crucial drivers of PD-induced peritoneal fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is regarded as a dysregulated immune response to infections. Recent study showed partially reversal of immunosuppression by trained immunity, which fosters an enhanced immune response towards a secondary challenge. However, the role of trained immunity in sepsis has not been fully understood. Methods We profiled the characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from septic patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. Murine double-hit models (pretreatment or post-treatment of β-glucan in septic mice) and murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were used then. Results scRNA-seq revealed that Ring finger protein 146 (RNF146) and protein kinase B (Akt) were downregulated in the immunosuppression period of septic patients and were verified to be decreased in bone marrow and spleen monocytes from septic mice. While β-glucan pretreatment improved the immunosuppressed state in septic mice and increased dectin-1/Akt/RNF146 expressions in monocytes, along with the increased survival rate, inflammatory factors and aerobic glycolysis, indicating a change from immunosuppression to immune training. Moreover, RNF146 regulated dectin-1-Akt-mTOR signaling in the trained immune state of murine monocyte/macrophage RAW264.7 cell line and the expression of RNF146 was dependent on dectin-1-Akt activation. The inhibition of dectin-1 by its antagonist laminarin downregulated Akt-RNF146 signaling and partially reversed β-glucan induced trained immunity in septic mice. Conclusion RNF146 and Akt are downregulated in the immunosuppression period of sepsis, while increased after β-glucan pretreatment induced trained immunity in septic mice. Moreover, RNF146 regulates the immune trained state of monocyte through dectin-1-Akt-mTOR pathway, suggesting a possible target in reversal of immunosuppression in sepsis.">

However, its potential remains understudied in combination therapies. Here, we develop a mathematical model to quantify the role of ICD in optimizing the efficacy of combined radiotherapy (RT) and macrophage-based immunotherapy. Using preclinical murine data targeting the SIRPα-CD47 checkpoint, we show that RT alone induces minimal ICD, whereas disrupting the SIRPα-CD47 axis significantly enhances both phagocytosis and systemic immune activation. Our model predicts an optimal RT dose (6–8 Gy) for maximizing ICD, a dose-dependent abscopal effect, and a hierarchy of treatment efficacy, with SIRPα-knockout macrophages exhibiting the strongest tumoricidal activity. These findings provide a quantitative framework for designing more effective combination therapies, leveraging ICD to enhance immune checkpoint inhibition and radiotherapy synergy.">

 Secretory IgA (sIgA) is critical for the maintenance of the mucosal barrier function, preventing bacterial translocation and reducing the risk of chronic inflammation. Several decades of research have revealed a dysregulation of the B-cell compartment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of yet unknown origin1,2. While increased serum levels of (auto)antibodies against S. cerevisiae or the intestinal M-cell expressed FimH receptor glycoprotein 2 (GP2) are observed in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD)3, some studies indicated an impaired generation of intestinal immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells (PCs)4. To unravel the role of mucosal humoral immunity in CD pathogenesis, we aimed to provide an in-depth characterisation of colonic PC differentiation in patients with CD.



 In-depth phenotyping of patients with CD in remission and non-IBD controls (hospitalised normals) was performed using multi-omics analyses (spatial single-cell proteomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) of plasma or colon biopsy samples. Colonic switched memory B cells (sMBCs) were sorted from lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNCs) by magnetic-activated cell sorting and ex vivo differentiated into PCs. The impact of mitochondrial function on colonic PC maturation was studied in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V-deficient ATP8 mutant mice and mice that underwent nutritional intervention.



 Despite a hyperactive colonic B-cell compartment, patients with CD displayed significantly diminished mucosal dimeric IgA (dIgA) and fecal IgA compared to non-IBD controls. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) expression did not differ, excluding a defective epithelial transcytosis of dIgA. Spatial single-cell proteomics uncovered that colonic plasmablasts and immature CD19+CD45+ PCs were increased at the expense of the fully mature CD19-CD45- phenotype. Consistently, PCs generated ex vivo from CD-derived sMBCs revealed impaired capacity to differentiate into IgA-secreting PCs. Metabolic phenotyping indicated a colonic mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with CD that was also reflected in colonic PCs by increased expression of the cell-surface NADase CD38 in concert with decreased expression of mitochondrially encoded transcripts. Of note, splenic PCs isolated from ATP8 mutant mice displayed a hyperproliferative and low-differentiated phenotype, while colonic IgA-secreting PCs were reduced. Conversely, feeding mice an isocaloric glucose-free, high-protein diet, which promotes mitochondrial activity, increased colonic IgA levels.



 In summary, this study links mitochondrial dysfunction to impaired PC differentiation in patients with CD, resulting in reduced levels of sIgA and thereby compromised mucosal barrier integrity.

        <tr id="Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is related to increased susceptibility to secondary infections and death. Lung is the most vulnerable target organ in sepsis, but the understanding of the pulmonary immunosuppression state is still limited. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is performed to map the landscape of immune cells, revealing a neutrophil-driven immunosuppressive program in the lungs of patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Although immunosuppressive genes are upregulated in different immune cells, only neutrophils dramatically increase in the BALF of patients in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Five neutrophil subpopulations in BALF are identified, among which CXCR2+ and CD274 (PD-L1 coding gene)+IL1RN+ neutrophil subpopulations increased significantly during septic immunosuppression. Interestingly, a developmental trajectory from CXCR2+ to CD274+IL1RN+ neutrophil subpopulation is disclosed. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CXCR2 blockade is observed on the survival of septic mice, along with a decreased number of PD-L1+ neutrophils. Taken together, the CXCR2+ neutrophil subpopulation is discovered as a contributor to immunosuppression in sepsis and identified it as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis treatment.">

        <tr id="Cytokines play a crucial role in mediating cell communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages are particularly influential in the regulation of immunosuppressive cytokines, thereby supporting tumor metastasis. The upregulation of Th2 cytokines in cancer cells is recognized for its involvement in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, the association between these cytokines and tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the connection between tumor-promoting macrophages and melanoma-derived EVs. The analysis from altered cytokine profile data showed that melanoma-derived EVs upregulate Th2 cytokine expression in naïve macrophages, thereby contributing to the promotion of tumor-supporting functions. Notably, many of these cytokines were also found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma patients (n = 30) compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Overall, our findings suggest a strong connection between melanoma secretory EVs and the induction of tumor-associated macrophages that facilitates the development of an immunosuppressive TME, supporting melanoma metastasis through regulation at both local and systemic levels.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
We report a case of relapse and refractory acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL) apparent turned to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is occasional and fatal during CAR-T treatment. There are still limited data to clarify the molecular mechanism of myeloid blast populations proliferation during CAR-T treatment.


CASE PRESENTATION
A 21-year-old man with an established history of r/r B-ALL with a complex chromosome karyotype and renal extramedullary infiltration presented to our institution. He exhibited a rapid relapse with acute monocytic leukemia 19 days after CD19 CAR-T cell infusion with extensive infiltration of skin and brain. Salvage chemotherapy was ineffective, and he subsequently succumbed to the uncontrolled invasion and infiltration of leukemia cells and hemorrhage. RNA velocity analysis predicted that HSCs differentiated into GMPs and then GMPs differentiated into myeloid lineage cells. The ANXA1-FPR1/2 axis expression was significantly increased post-treatment, which promotes tumor cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. 6q deletion (6q-) was the common genetic abnormality across all cell populations, indicating that 6q- conferred a survival ability to HSCs during CAR-T cell therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
This case demonstrates potential mechanisms of clone evolution molecular events that CD19 CAR-T cell infusion accelerated the existing myeloid lineage evolution via ANXA1-FPR1/2 axis expression from HSCs with 6q-. (Cyto-)genetic aberrations and/or pathways previously not included in the risk stratification of B-ALL might well be predictive for response and outcome in the era of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare haematological cancer with poor 5-years overall survival (OS) and high relapse rate. Leukemic cells are sensitive to Natural Killer (NK) cell mediated killing. However, NK cells are highly impaired in AML, which promote AML immune escape from NK cell immune surveillance. We made the first report of CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion in AML. This unconventional subset has been reported to expand in some chronic viral infections. Although it is unclear whether CD56neg NK cells expansion mechanism is common across diseases, it seems more relevant than ever to further investigate this subset, representing a potential therapeutic target. Methods We used PBMCs from AML patients and HV to perform mass cytometry, spectral flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq and in vitro assays in order to better characterize CD56neg CD16+ NK cells that expand in AML. Results We confirmed that CD56neg CD16+ NK cells represent a unique NK cell subset coexpressing Eomes and T-bet. CD56neg CD16+ NK cells could recover CD56 expression in vitro where they displayed unaltered NK cell functions. We previously demonstrated that CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion at diagnosis was associated with adverse clinical outcome in AML. Here, we validated our findings in a validation cohort of N=38 AML patients. AML patients with CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion at diagnosis had decreased overall survival (HR[CI95]=5.5[1.2-24.5], p=0.0251) and relapse-free survival (HR[CI95]=13.1[1.9-87.5], p=0.0079) compared to AML patients without expansion after 36 months follow-up. RNA-seq unveiled that CD56neg CD16+ NK cells were mature circulating NK cells with functional capacities. Upon expansion, CD56neg CD16+ NK cells from AML patients showed altered proteomic phenotype, with increased frequency of terminally mature CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expressing TIGIT along with decreased frequency of Siglec-7+ CD56neg CD16+ NK cells. Discussion Taken together, our results suggest that we could harness CD56neg CD16+ NK cells cytotoxic potential in vitro to restore NK cell anti-tumor response in AML patients with CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion and improve patients’ prognosis. To conclude, CD56neg CD16+ NK cells represent a relevant target for future NK-cell-based immunotherapies in AML.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system acts as the body’s frontline defense, detecting and responding to pathogenic threats with remarkable precision. Central to this defense are inflammatory markers, including cytokines, chemokines, acute-phase proteins, and cellular mediators. These markers not only recognize infections and cellular damage but also orchestrate immune cell recruitment and signal the activation of adaptive immunity. Key cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 play dual roles in promoting inflammation and restoring homeostasis. Similarly, chemokines like CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL2 (MCP-1) guide immune cells to infection sites. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like and NOD-like receptors, are vital for detecting pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, triggering signaling cascades that amplify the inflammatory response. Clinically, these markers are invaluable for diagnosing infections, monitoring inflammatory diseases, and predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, their dysregulation is implicated in chronic inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases like sepsis and COVID-19. Emerging therapies targeting cytokine signaling pathways and PRRs hold promise for mitigating excessive inflammation while preserving host defense. This review highlights the pivotal roles of inflammatory markers in innate immunity, focusing on their detection mechanisms, activation pathways, and therapeutic potential. Advancing our understanding of these markers will enable precise modulation of immune responses, offering innovative solutions to manage inflammatory and infectious diseases.

        <tr id="Abstract The discovery that natural killer (NK) cells can retain features of “memory” from previous stimulation and pathogen exposure was a landmark advance highlighting one of many ways in which NK cells of the innate immune system resemble T cells of the adaptive immune system. This ability to “remember” prior stimulation to bring about enhanced protection of the host sparked significant excitement regarding potential therapeutic applications. Yet, how closely the features of naïve and memory NK cells recapitulate those of T cells remains unclear. Nonetheless, despite unresolved questions about the immunobiology of naïve and memory NK cells, the application of memory NK cells to the clinic for cancer and other indications has gathered steam to meet the unmet need for novel immunotherapies. Recent work from Arellano-Ballestero et al highlights this evolving field and the current state of the art with memory NK cells. Application of these cells to the clinic is progressing with promising results, but important questions remain about the essential molecular, phenotypic, and functional characteristics that define a memory NK cell.">

        <tr id="CCR2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is widely expressed on monocytes, macrophages, activated T cells, and other cell types, and plays a critical role in coordinating the immune response to various infections. Here we demonstrate that CCR2 expression is significantly elevated during Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) respiratory infection, and its absence leads to exacerbated susceptibility, as evidenced by significant weight loss, higher bacterial loads, severe lung pathology, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β, tnfα, and il-6). The absence of ccr2 impairs both myeloid cell infiltration and T cell responses, which are crucial for effective immune defense. Specifically, ccr2 deficiency disrupts the differentiation and response of Th1 cells, which are the primary effector lineage responsible for clearing chlamydia through secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). As a result, there is a significant decrease in CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells in the lung and spleen, accompanied by reduced levels of IFN-γ protein and mRNA, as well as downregulated mRNA expression of Th1-promoting cytokines (il-12p35, il-12p40) and transcription factors (stat4, T-bet), which play crucial roles in Th1 differentiation. Moreover, ccr2 deficiency greatly diminishes STAT1 phosphorylation, a key regulator of IFN-γ secretion by Th1 cells. Meanwhile, we also observed a significant reduction in IFN-γ secretion by CD8+ T cells following ccr2 deficiency. Conversely, ccr2-/- mice exhibit an exaggerated Th2-type immune response, with elevated levels of Th2-promoting cytokines (IL-4), transcription factors (STAT6 and gata3), and il-5, which together lead to more severe lung tissue damage and increased susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, these mice show higher levels of IL-17 along with an enhanced Th17-type immune response, characterized by increased Th17-promoting cytokines TGFB, transcription factors stat3 and RORγt, and il-21, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that drives neutrophil infiltration to exacerbate lung inflammation. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CCR2, a chemokine receptor, in orchestrating the immune response to Chlamydia infection by facilitating Th1 cells differentiation while restraining Th2-type and Th17-type immune responses, thereby alleviating pulmonary inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Subjects with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), such as rheumatoid arthritis, with tuberculosis infection (TBI), have a high probability of progressing to tuberculosis disease (TB). We aim to characterize the impact of IMID on the immune response to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in patients with TBI and TB disease. Methods We enrolled TBI and TB patients with and without IMID. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with Mtb-derived epitopes (MTB300). By flow-cytometry, we identified the Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells as cytokine-producing T cells or as CD25+ CD134+ CD4+ T cells. Memory and activation status of Mtb-specific T cells were assessed by evaluating: CD153, HLA-DR, CD45RA, CD27. Mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) was used to evaluate the ability of PBMCs to inhibit mycobacteria growth. A long-term stimulation assay was used to detect a memory response. Results The IMID status and therapy did not affect the magnitude of response to Mtb-antigen stimulation and the number of responders. TBI-IMID showed a cytokine profile like TBI and TB patients. The Mtb response of TBI-IMID patients was characterized by an effector memory and central memory phenotype as in TBI and TB groups. This memory phenotype allowed the increased IFN-γ production after 6 days of MTB300-stimulation. HLA-DR expression on Mtb-specific T cells was associated with TB, whereas CD153 was associated with TBI status. Finally, the TBI-IMID had an MGIA response like TBI and TB patients. Conclusion IMID condition does not affect key aspects of the immune response to Mtb, such as the cytokine response, memory and activation profile, and the ability to contain the mycobacteria replication. The immunological characterization of the fragile population of TBI-IMID patients is fundamental to understanding the correlation between protection and disease.">

        <tr id="Chronic immunosuppressive therapies are crucial in organ transplantation but can increase the risk of opportunistic infections and cancer over time. We investigated immune status changes in 10 kidney transplant patients and 11 age-matched healthy adults using broad in vitro stimulation of subject-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells followed by mass cytometry by time of flight over 6 mo. Overall, the immune cells of transplant patients exhibited increased CD8+ T cell activation and differentiation compared with healthy donors, with elevated CD8+ CD57+, MIP-1β, and interferon γ production (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, and P < 0.01, respectively). CD107a and granzyme B expression were increased in CD8+ T cells and CD56bright natural killer cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), while T regulatory cells had decreased interleukin-10 production (P < 0.05). These changes indicated a proinflammatory environment influenced by induction therapy and ongoing maintenance drugs. Additionally, transplant recipients displayed signs of immune modulation, including decreased tumor necrosis factor α, interferon γ, and MIP-1β expression in γδT cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01), and reduced interleukin-17 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression in CD8+ T memory cell subsets (P < 0.05). The diverse functional changes underscore the importance of comprehensive immune status profiling for optimizing individual treatment strategies and developing better immunosuppressants that specifically target activated cell populations.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are critical regulators of T-cell exhaustion, impairing their ability to eliminate antigens present during chronic viral infections. Current immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in the clinic aim to reinvigorate exhausted T cells; yet, most patients fail to respond or develop resistance to these therapies, underscoring the need to better understand these immunosuppressive pathways. PSGL-1 (Selplg), a recently discovered immune checkpoint, negatively regulates T-cell function. We investigated the cell-intrinsic effects of PSGL-1, PD-1, and combined deletion on CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection. We found that combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 (Selplg-/-Pdcd1-/-) deficiency in CD8+ T cells increased their frequencies and numbers throughout chronic infection compared to the wild type. This phenotype was primarily driven by PD-1 deficiency. Furthermore, while PD-1 deletion increased virus-specific T-cell frequencies, it was detrimental to their function. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improved T-cell function but resulted in lower frequencies and numbers. The primary mechanism behind these differences in cell maintenance was driven by proliferation rather than survival. Combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 deletion resulted in defective T-cell differentiation, driving cells from a progenitor self-renewal state to a more terminal dysfunctional state. These findings suggest that PD-1 and PSGL-1 have distinct, yet complementary, roles in regulating T-cell exhaustion and differentiation during chronic viral infection. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the individual and combined roles of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. It underscores the potential of targeting these checkpoints in a more dynamic and sequential manner to optimize virus-specific T-cell responses, offering critical perspectives for improving therapeutic strategies aimed at reinvigorating exhausted CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEOur findings provide a comprehensive analysis of how the dual deletion of PD-1 and PSGL-1 impacts the response and function of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, revealing novel insights into their roles in chronic infection. Notably, our findings show that while PD-1 deletion enhances T-cell frequencies, it paradoxically reduces T-cell functionality. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improves T-cell function but reduces their survival. Whereas the combined deletion of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T cells improved their survival but decreased their function and progenitor-exhausted phenotypes during infection. We believe our study advances the understanding of immune checkpoint regulation in chronic infections and has significant implications for developing more effective immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies.">

        <tr id="Objective Circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) are closely related to immune tolerance and maintenance of immune homeostasis. Perhaps, there is a unique immune cell phenotype for difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA). Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been considered for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This study focused on the uniqueness of D2T RA lymphocyte subsets and the feasibility of low-dose IL-2 therapy. Methods Participants included 1,042 RA patients who were divided into three groups according to the presence or absence of treatment and their response to treatment in the last 6 months—new group, treated group, and D2T group—and 339 healthy controls (HCs). A total of 381 patients—107, 151, and 123 in each of the three experimental groups—received low-dose IL-2 treatment [0.5 million international units (MIU) per day, subcutaneous injection from day 1 to day 5]. The absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were detected by flow cytometry (FCM) and serum cytokine levels were detected by flow cytometry bead array (CBA). Results The absolute number of T, CD4+ T, and Treg cells in the D2T RA group was lower than that in the HC, new, and treated RA groups. Compared with the HC and new RA group, the ratio of Th17/Treg cells in the D2T RA group increased. The new, treated, and D2T RA groups had higher cytokine levels than the HC. The number of Treg cells in RA patients was negatively correlated with the disease activity index. Treg cells in the new, treated, and D2T RA groups could be increased by low-dose IL-2 therapy without any side effects. Conclusions The number of lymphocytes and subsets in D2T RA patients was reduced, especially Treg cells, resulting in a shift in the balance of effector T cells/Treg cells toward effector T cells, which is ameliorated by low-dose IL-2 without obvious side effects.">

        <tr id="Background: Immune dysregulation is a component of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Cannabidiol (CBD) has immunomodulatory and putative antidepressant effects. The relationship between apoptotic and exhaustion immune markers and the clinical features of MDD and the effects of CBD on these markers are still unknown. Objectives: To assess pro-apoptotic (CD95) and T cell exhaustion (TIM3) markers on immune cells in patients with MDD, as well as the impact of in vitro CBD administration on these markers. Methods: We recruited healthy controls and MDD patients and evaluated the immunophenotypes of T/B lymphocytes using flow cytometry in unstimulated and anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated conditions. We evaluated the immune profiles of M1 macrophages, T helper (Th)17 cells, immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), T cell proliferation, and immune-related neurotoxicity (IRN). We investigated the in vitro effects of CBD on immune cell subsets at concentrations of 0.1 ug/mL, 1 ug/mL, and 10.0 ug/mL. Results: The stimulated CD3+CD95+ cell percentages were substantially correlated with the number of depressive episodes, recurrence of illness, and suicidal behaviors. The stimulated CD8+TIM-3+ cell percentages were substantially and inversely associated with the M1, IRS, CIRS, T cell growth, and IRN immune profiles. TIM-3+ bearing CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD20+ cells were significantly suppressed by lower CBD concentrations (0.1 to 1 ug/mL). TIM3+ and all CD95+ bearing cells, with the exception of CD3+CD95+, were suppressed by the higher CBD concentrations. Discussion: Aberrations in immune checkpoint molecular processes impact the features of MDD. CBD significantly impacts apoptotic and exhaustion processes thereby possibly interfering with immune homeostasis.">

 Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine linked to inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where it contributes to inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis. Despite its established role, the specific signals driving OSM expression in colitis remain unclear.



 Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated using M-CSF and stimulated for 36 hours with a range of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and bacterial lysates. OSM secretion was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To dissect key signaling pathways, we applied chemical inhibitors and utilized macrophages derived from gene-deficient mice.



 Myd88-dependent stimuli, including TLR1/2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR4 (LPS), TLR2/6 (FSL-1), TLR7/8 (R848), IL-1α, and IL-33, significantly increased OSM expression in BMDMs. Gram-negative (E. coli, C. rodentium) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacterial lysates also enhanced OSM secretion. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ further boosted OSM levels, consistent with in vivo findings of OSM upregulation in inflammatory monocytes. Additionally, IL-4, which induces a tissue repair phenotype in macrophages, markedly increased OSM secretion.



 OSM expression in BMDMs is driven by multiple signaling pathways, indicating a synergistic effect of diverse stimuli. Identifying key stimulatory and inhibitory molecules, alongside macrophage-specific knockout analyses, will help clarify the upstream regulators of OSM. Understanding these drivers may uncover new therapeutic targets in IBD and offer insights into the onset of fibrotic processes.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Tumour-infiltrating T cells can mediate both antitumour immunity and promote tumour progression by creating an immunosuppressive environment. This dual role is especially relevant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterised by a unique microenvironment and limited success with current immunotherapy.


OBJECTIVE
We evaluated T cell responses in patients with advanced HCC by analysing tumours, liver flushes and liver-draining lymph nodes, to understand whether reactive T cell populations could be identified despite the immunosuppressive environment.


DESIGN
T cells isolated from clinical samples were tested for reactivity against predicted neoantigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to evaluate the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of antigen-experienced T cells. Neoantigen-reactive T cells expressing 4-1BB were isolated and characterised through T-cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing.


RESULTS
Bioinformatic analysis identified 542 candidate neoantigens from seven patients. Of these, 78 neoantigens, along with 11 hotspot targets from HCC driver oncogenes, were selected for ex vivo T cell stimulation. Reactivity was confirmed in co-culture assays for 14 targets, with most reactive T cells derived from liver flushes and lymph nodes. Liver flush-derived T cells exhibited central memory and effector memory CD4+ with cytotoxic effector profiles. In contrast, tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an exhausted profile were primarily identified in the draining lymph nodes.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer valuable insights into the functional profiles of neoantigen-reactive T cells within and surrounding the HCC microenvironment. T cells isolated from liver flushes and tumour-draining lymph nodes may serve as a promising source of reactive T cells and TCRs for further use in immunotherapy for HCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Many human autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are hallmarked by the presence and persistence of autoreactive B‐cells. While autoreactive B‐cells may frequently encounter antigens, the signals required to balance and maintain their activation and survival are mostly unknown. Understanding such signals may be important for strategies aimed at eliminating human B‐cell autoreactivity. Here, we assessed intracellular signaling pathways in B cells targeting citrullinated protein antigens isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common and well‐characterized AID. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 15 RA patients positive for anti‐citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) were analyzed directly ex vivo using spectral flow cytometry and B‐cell differentiation markers, citrullinated antigen‐biotin‐streptavidin tetramers, and intracellular (phosphoflow) markers. Tetanus toxoid (TT)‐specific B cells served as antigen‐specific comparators. In absence of any in vitro BCR stimulation, ACPA‐expressing memory B cells (MBCs) displayed enhanced expression of Ki‐67 and increased SYK‐, BTK‐, AKT‐, and S6‐phosphorylation compared with TT‐specific MBCs. We demonstrate the simultaneous detection of B cell antigen‐specificity and intracellular protein phosphorylation on the single‐cell level. The data reveal that autoreactive B‐cells in RA, in contrast to B cells against recall antigens, display enhanced phosphorylation of signaling molecules that point toward continuous, presumably antigen‐mediated activation of the autoreactive B‐cell compartment.">

 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with severe chronic inflammatory conditions that are refractory to conventional treatment, including Crohn’s disease. The success of aHSCT is thought to be grounded in resetting the break of immunological tolerance, but the exact mechanisms underlying a favourable response remain incompletely understood.



 We followed the immune reconstitution of 9 patients with severe refractory Crohn’s disease from one month until more than 2 years post-aHSCT. We performed flow cytometry to follow immune cell populations and functional T cells markers over time, in addition to Olink proteomics to study the inflammatory response in serum.



 Transplantation proceeded safely, without major adverse events in any of the 9 patients. aHSCT resulted in considerable improvement of disease status in 6 patients, with 3 patients classified as non-responders. After transplantation, we observed a strong change in the peripheral T-cell subset composition, with a reduction of the CD4/CD8 ratio and a reduction of naïve over effector memory (EM) T cells. Non-responders appeared distinct by a higher CD4/CD8 ratio and higher naïve over T-EM frequencies already before transplantation, and a smaller change in subset composition after transplantation. Remarkably, the local T-cell composition did not mirror the changes in the periphery, with an increased CD4/CD8 ratio in intestinal biopsies post-aHSCT, underscoring that a more detailed study of local versus peripheral responses to aHSCT is essential in aiding our understanding of its efficacy. Functionally, the changes in the peripheral T-cell profile were minimal and not clearly related to response. Although the pro-inflammatory profile was not altered, we did find a small but significant increase in the expression of regulatory markers.



 aHSCT resulted in strong changes in the T-cell subset composition of Crohn’s disease patients, but only small changes in functional markers related to inflammation, regulation and homing. Non-responders could be distinguished at baseline by a different T-cell composition and also experienced less profound changes herein upon transplantation.

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can result in cure in some patients. Analogous to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, we hypothesized that allogeneic cellular immunotherapies, including alloSCT and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), would impact malignant evolution through the application of selective immunologic pressure with reciprocal changes in the T cell compartment. We tested a cohort of 24 patients treated with HLA-matched alloSCT +/− DLI, two mediators of the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. Comparison of pre-alloSCT samples revealed that a key difference between responders (n=13) and non-responders (n=11) is the cellularity of leukemic cells. We further mapped mutational trajectories of tumor cells by whole exome sequencing (WES) of sort-purified CLL in 11 post-transplant relapsed patients and found evidence of subclonal leukemic evolution in 8/11 patients after nonmyeloablative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched alloSCT. Different patterns of CLL evolution were observed, and these changes included putative CLL drivers in every case. To investigate the presence of immune-related variants in patients, we collected 19 T cell co-culture CRISPR datasets and identified the top positive and negative regulators of cancer cell’s response to T-cell-dependent killing. We found that most mutations linked to T-cell killing emerged after allo-SCT treatment, suggesting that selective pressures from the GVL effect may drive the evolution of these mutations. Together, these data identify cellular homogeneity as a key biomarker for susceptibility to GVL-driven immunity in CLL and illustrate how the leukemic cells further evolve to evade immunosurveillance. SIGNIFICANCE The impact of allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) on subclonal leukemia evolution remains poorly understood. By performing whole exome sequencing (WES) on pre- and post-alloSCT patient samples, we reveal different patterns of CLL evolution and potential immune-related driver genes influencing CLL relapse and refractory disease post-alloSCT.">

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has attained unprecedented clinical success, the tolerance and immune suppression mechanisms evolved by tumor cells and their tumor microenvironment (TME) hinder its maximum anti-cancer potential. Ferroptosis therapy can partially improve the efficacy of ICB, but it is still subject to immune suppression by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME. Recent research suggests that an MDSC blockade can unleash the full therapeutic potential of the combined therapy of ferroptosis and ICB in liver cancer treatment. However, whether blocking the intrinsic ferroptosis pathways of MDSCs can relieve imidazole ketone erastin (IKE)-initiated ferroptosis-induced immune suppression and ultimately trigger the optimal therapeutic effect of the combined ferroptosis and ICB therapy is still unknown. Here, we report that TIPE2, a phospholipid transfer protein, regulated the ferroptosis susceptibility in MDSCs through reprogramming lipid peroxidation-related phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species composition. TIPE2-deficient MDSCs resisted IKE-induced ferroptosis by up-regulating SLC7A11 and GPX4, and dissolved ferroptosis-induced immunosuppressive function by down-regulating lipid ROS whilst encouraging T cell proliferation and infiltration into tumor tissues to improve ferroptosis therapy. More importantly, TIPE2-deficient MDSCs achieved the full anti-tumor therapeutic potential of IKE-induced ferroptosis therapy and a PD-L1 blockade. These findings indicate that TIPE2 confers the ferroptosis sensitivity of MDSCs, and combining the targeting of the TIPE2 of MDSCs, ferroptosis therapy, and ICB is a novel therapeutic option for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Exhausted T cell (Tex) is a specific state of T cell dysfunction, in which these T cells gradually lose their effector function and change their phenotype during chronic antigen stimulation. The enrichment of exhausted CD8+ T cell (CD8+ Tex) in the tumor microenvironment is one of the important reasons leading to the poor efficacy of immunotherapy. Recent studies have reported many reasons leading to the CD8+ T cell exhaustion. In addition to cancer cells, myeloid cells can also contribute to T cell exhaustion via many ways. In this review, we discuss the history of the concept of exhaustion, CD8+ T cell dysfunction states, the heterogeneity, origin, and characteristics of CD8+ Tex. We then focus on the effects of myeloid cells on CD8+ Tex, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils. Finally, we systematically summarize current strategies and recent advancements in therapies reversing and CD8+ T cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="Solid organ transplantation has significantly improved the survival rate of patients with terminal organ failure. However, its success is often compromised by allograft rejection, a process in which T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a crucial role. These cells facilitate rejection by enhancing neutrophil infiltration into the graft and by activating endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Additionally, Th17 cells can trigger the activation of other T cell types, including Th1, Th2, and CD8+ T cells, further contributing to rejection. An imbalance between Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is known to promote rejection. To counteract this, immunosuppressive drugs have been developed to inhibit T cell activity and foster transplant tolerance. Another approach involves the adoptive transfer of regulatory cells, such as Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, to dampen T cell functions. This review primarily focuses on the roles of Th17 cells in rejection and their interactions with other T cell subsets. We also explore various strategies aimed at suppressing T cells to induce tolerance.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells both play essential roles in controlling viral infections by eliminating virus-infected cells. Unlike CTLs, which require priming and activation by antigen-presenting cells, NK cells possess a remarkable capacity to mount a rapid antiviral immune response immediately after infection. Additionally, they can bolster the adaptive immune system by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with other immune cells. However, during chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, various immune cells, including NK cells, experience functional impairments. This has led to the exploration of NK cell-based immunotherapy as a promising strategy to reverse these dysfunctions and contribute to the pursuit of a functional cure for HIV. Building on the success of NK cell therapies in cancer treatment, these approaches offer significant potential for transforming the HIV cure field. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in NK cell-based immunotherapy for HIV, outlining the progress made and the key challenges that must be overcome to achieve a functional cure for people living with HIV.">

        <tr id="Epstein-Barr virus-induced 3 (EBI3) functions as a component of the heterodimer cytokine IL-27, which regulates innate and acquired immune responses. The expression of EBI3 gene is induced by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Repeated treatment with imiquimod (IMQ), a TLR7 agonist, induces splenomegaly and cytopaenia due to increased splenic function. Although immune cell activation is speculated to play a role in chronic infection-mediated splenomegaly, the detailed mechanisms remain unknown. This study shows that IMQ treatment induces marked splenomegaly and severe bicytopaenia (anaemia and thrombocytopaenia) in wild-type mice. In IMQ-treated mice, myeloid cell populations in the spleen increased, and extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed. RNA-seq analysis revealed the upregulation of type I interferon (IFN)-related genes in the spleens of IMQ-treated mice. IMQ-induced pathological changes were partially mitigated by EBI3 deficiency. To investigate the mechanism of the improved phenotypes in the Ebi3 KO mice, we examined the involvement of IL-27, a heterodimer of EBI3 and IL-27p28. The expression of Il27a, which encodes IL-27p28, was increased in the spleen and peripheral blood by IMQ treatment. Furthermore, IL-27 stimulation upregulated type I IFN-related genes in bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures without type I IFN. These findings suggest that EBI3 deficiency mitigated IMQ-mediated pathological changes, presumably via a lack of IL-27 formation. Our study thus provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic infection-mediated splenomegaly.">

        <tr id="Background Although tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) play crucial roles in the anti-tumor immune response and are associated with favorable prognoses in many solid tumors, the precise mechanisms by which TLSs enhance anti-tumor immunity remain poorly understood. The current study aimed to explore the relationship between the maturity of tertiary lymphoid structures and their key immune cells in combating breast cancer. Patients and methods In this study, we utilized immunofluorescence and H&E staining to detect tumor-resident memory T cells (Trm) and assess the maturity of TLS, analyzing their distribution and proportion in an annotated cohort of 95 breast cancer patients. Results The presence of tumor-associated TLSs was correlated with an improved prognosis in patients with breast cancer. The proportion of CD8+CD103+ resident memory T cells and natural killer (NK) cells within the TLSs was significantly higher than that in areas outside of these structures. Additionally, the proportions of CD103+ CD8+ Trm cells and NK cells were significantly increased with the gradual maturation of TLS. Furthermore, the secretion function of effector molecules by CD8+ CD103+ Trm cells and NK cells within TLSs was significantly enhanced, indicating a strong correlation between the effector function of CD103+ CD8+ Trm and NK cells and the maturity of TLSs. Conclusion Our study identifies potential additional prognostic information for the clinical prognosis of breast cancer patients, underscoring the prognostic significance of immune cells within TLS, with a particular focus on CD103+ CD8+ Trm cells and NK cells.">

        <tr id="The role of natural killer (NK) cells, which mediate innate immunity, in the immune reconstitution of people living with HIV (PLWH) remains unclear. Our previous research indicated that early activation of CD56dimCD16dim/- NK cells plays an important role in the recovery of CD4+ T cells in immunological non-responders (INRs) after ART. This study mainly focuses on the profiles of cell receptors and their relative ligands for NK cells and CD4+ T cells exhibited on INRs and immunological responders (IRs) in order to analyze the impact of differential immune status on immune reconstitution in PLWH receiving ART.This study included 66 PLWH who had been on ART for 4 years, comprising 32 INRs and 34 IRs. Using flow cytometry, we examined the expression of cell receptors and ligands for NK cells and CD4+ T cells in PBMCs, as well as the differentiation of CD4+ T cells.The expression of NKG2D ligands, including MICA/B and ULBP2-5, on CD4+ T cells in INRs is elevated prior to ART. Further research found that the expression of CD95 on MICA/B+CD4+ T cells and ULBP2-5+CD4+ T cells was higher in INRs before ART compared to IRs. Simultaneously, the percentages of death receptor CD95 expression on MICA/B+CD4+ T cells and on ULBP2-5+CD4+ T cells before ART were negatively correlated with CD4+ T-cell counts and ΔCD4. Among the CD4+ T-cell subsets, an imbalance persists in the CD4+ Tcm and CD4+ Temra subsets in both INRs and IRs, before or after ART. CD4+ T cells exhibit elevated levels of activation, proliferation, exhaustion, and apoptosis prior to ART initiation. However, CD4+ T-cell activation and proliferation normalize post-ART, while apoptosis and exhaustion levels remain significantly elevated. Regardless of ART, the anti-apoptotic capacity of CD4+ T cells in INRs is still lower than that of IRs and healthy controls (HCs). Before ART, the frequency of CD31 expression on naive CD4+ T cells in INRs is lower than that in IRs and HCs. Following ART, the amounts of CD31+ Tn from CD4+ T cells remain impaired in both INRs and IRs compared to HCs.The upregulation of related ligands for the NKG2D receptor on CD4+ T cells in INRs is associated with increased susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to NK cell-mediated killing. CD95 may plays an important role in poor recovery of CD4+ T cells co-expressing NKG2D-related ligands. The imbalance in CD4+ Tcm and CD4+ Temra subset homeostasis and impaired CD31 expression on naive CD4+ T cells in INRs are associated with poor immune reconstitution outcomes.">

 Immunotherapies are a transformative force in clinical oncology, delivering prolonged disease-free survival in refractory cancers. However, in the setting of breast malignancies, clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are both low and ephemeral, particularly in the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtype. Effective responses are predicated on abundant neoantigens, the activity of immune effector cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the establishment of immunological memory. These prerequisites pose a significant efficacy barrier as BC patients carry low mutational burdens (neoantigens), and T-cells are profoundly hindered by the presence of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Radiotherapy (RT) holds a significant untapped potential to overcome the lack of neoantigens by triggering immunogenic cell death and recruiting adaptive immunity. However, the unavoidable tissue damage and clearance of dead cells by adjacent macrophages further enhance their wound-healing (immunosuppressive) phenotype, dampening the immunogenic potential of RT. Macrophages regulate immune responses through remarkably plastic activation states, including immune-stimulatory (M1) and immune-suppressive (M2). In breast tumors, macrophages undergo a well-documented but poorly understood “M2-education” process that facilitates immune evasion, utilizing a myriad of immune modulators (hormones, cytokines, and enzymes). Collectively, these dependencies highlight a tremendous therapeutic potential for combining RT with strategies that recover the M1 phenotype of TAMs, creating immune-supportive TME. Despite the potential, modulating TAM activities has proven exceptionally challenging, primarily due to the pleiotropic nature of their suppressive functions and the lack of scalable TME models to enable high-throughput target discovery. To overcome these limitations, we developed a scalable platform that recreates the breast TME at scale and phenotypic fidelity. This model contains the major BC constituents, including macrophages, tumor cells, and their supporting stroma, while preserving the functions, transcriptional programs, cell-cell interactions, and typical spatial organization. To identify reprogramming targets in TAMs, we performed a CRISPR screen utilizing Arg1 (a hallmark M2 marker) as a surrogate marker. Our screen exposed targets that convert immunosuppressive (M2) TAMs into immunostimulatory (M1) macrophages in established tumors. In vivo data show that TAM reprogramming is remarkably effective, promoting tumor regression and abscopal effect in HR+ and ovarian cancers. Reprogrammed TAMs enhanced responses to ICI and radiotherapy, a path we plan to optimize for future clinical development as “first-in-human” trials. Interventions that re-potentiate innate and adaptive immunities can benefit cancer patients, particularly those with limited therapeutic options. Our findings pioneer an actionable roadmap to unlock the full therapeutic potential of RT and immunotherapies in refractory human cancers.

Of note, the modulation of cytokine production and its release can significantly influence the immune response. Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are cytokines that play a crucial role in innate immunity due to their potent antiviral effects, regulation of IFN-stimulated genes essential for viral clearance, and the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, an understanding of the dual role of IFN-I (protective versus harmful) during HIV-1 infections and elucidating its contributions to HIV pathogenesis is crucial for advancing HIV therapeutic interventions.

Regulatory B-cells (Bregs, CD19+CD24hiCD38hi) are a specialized B-cell subset that suppresses immune responses and potentially contribute to the maintenance of an immune-privileged environment for fetal development during pregnancy. However, little is known about the surrounding immunological environment of Bregs in gestational physiology. The relationship of regulatory T-cells (Tregs, CD4+CD25hiCD127loFoxP3+) to Bregs in coordinating immunoregulation during pregnancy is unknown. We aimed to determine whether peripheral concentrations of Bregs and/or PD-L1-expressing Bregs correlated with Tregs and cytokines during pregnancy.


METHOD
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 29 pregnant women at mean 12 weeks' gestation. Participants were age ≥ 18, self-identified as Latina/Hispanic, and N = 12 primigravid. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine percentages of Tregs from CD4+ T-cells and five Treg subsets defined by immune checkpoint markers, and Bregs and PD-L1+ Bregs from total B-cells. Levels of 13 cytokines were measured on a Meso Scale Discovery multiplex platform.


RESULTS
Bregs positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6. PD-L1+ Bregs positively correlated with T-cell suppressive cytokine IL-10. PD-L1+ Bregs negatively correlated with Tregs and Helios+, CTLA-4+, PD-1+, TIGIT+, and TIM3+ Tregs. For primigravida, PD-L1+ Bregs correlated positively with IL-10 and negatively with Helios+ and TIGIT+ Tregs. For multigravida, PD-L1+ Bregs correlated positively with IL-8 and negatively with Helios+, CTLA-4+, PD-1+, and TIGIT+ Tregs.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides insight into the immunosuppressive role of Bregs and PD-L1+ Bregs during human pregnancy. Our results suggest that PD-L1+ Bregs can employ suppressive mechanisms to limit pro-inflammatory responses in primigravida.">

        <tr id="Tissue-repair regulatory T cells (trTregs) comprise a specialized cell subset essential for tissue homeostasis and repair. While well-studied in sterile injury models, their role in infection-induced tissue damage and antimicrobial immunity is less understood. We investigated trTreg dynamics during acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection, marked by extensive tissue damage and strong CD8+ immunity. Unlike sterile injury models, trTregs significantly declined in secondary lymphoid organs and non-lymphoid target tissues during infection, correlating with systemic and local tissue damage, and downregulation of function-associated genes in skeletal muscle. This decline was linked to decreased systemic IL-33 levels, a key trTreg growth factor, and promoted by the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ. Early recombinant IL-33 treatment increased trTregs, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and parasite-specific CD8+ cells at specific time points after infection, leading to reduced tissue damage, lower parasite burden, and improved disease outcome. Our findings not only provide novel insights into trTregs during infection but also highlight the potential of optimizing immune balance by modulating trTreg responses to promote tissue repair while maintaining effective pathogen control during infection-induced injury.">

        <tr id="Infectious agents have closely interacted with the human immune system, acquiring a set of highly sophisticated mechanisms for modulating immunity. One of the survival strategies for viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths and fungi is to target the regulatory T cell network (Treg: CD4+CD25hiCD127-) that controls immunopathogenic responses in many infections. Not only pathogens but also commensals are able to directly induce the conversion of naive T cells into suppressive Foxp3-expressing Tregs, while others activate pre-existing natural Tregs, in both cases suppressing pathogen-specific effector responses. However, Tregs can also contribute to immunity under certain conditions, such as at the initial stages of infection when effector cells must gain access to the site of infection, and subsequently in ensuring the generation of effector memory cells. It is noteworthy that currently little information on whether infections selectively drive pathogen-specific Tregs, and if so, whether such cells are also reactive to autoantigens are available. Further analysis of Treg subset specificity, along with a clearer picture of relative dynamics during the disease, should lead to rational strategies of immune intervention to optimize immunity and eliminate the infectious process. Thus, restoration of Treg function is important in the treatment of infectious, autoimmune and other diseases and can serve as a marker of their successful treatment. The article assesses the effect of exometabolites of derived from permafrost Bacillus bacteria obtained at different temperature conditions of their cultivation on the activity of Treg and effector T lymphocyte differentiation. Significant differences were established: secondary microbial exometabolites affect Treg (CD4+CD25hiCD127-) differentiation and expression of activation markers (CD69, CD25, HLA-DR) on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. This effect is regulated by the type of metabolites obtained at different temperatures - "cold" (obtained at 5°C of bacterial incubation), "medium-temperature" (at 22°C) and "heat" (at 37°C) metabolites. In this case, an increase in the Treg level is associated with lower differentiation activity of CD4+ T-lymphocytes exposed to “cold” secondary exometabolites, a decrease in the differentiation activity of CD8+ T-lymphocytes treated with “warm” secondary exometabolites, and a roughly equivalent effect on the differentiation activity of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes acted upon by “medium-temperature” secondary exometabolites.">

        <tr id="T cell-based therapies, including Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy (TIL), T cell receptor engineered T cells (TCR T), and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR T), are powerful therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. While these therapies are primarily known for their direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, accumulating evidence indicates that they also influence the tumor microenvironment (TME), by altering the cytokine milieu and recruiting additional effector populations to help orchestrate the antitumor immune response. Conversely, the TME itself can modulate the behaviour of these therapies within the host by either supporting or inhibiting their activity. In this review we provide an overview of clinical and preclinical data on the bidirectional influences between T cell therapies and the TME. Unravelling the interactions between T cell-based therapies and the TME is critical for a better understanding of their mechanisms of action, resistance, and toxicity, with the goal of optimizing efficacy and safety.">

        <tr id="Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is associated with germline RUNX1 mutations, establishing a preleukemic state and increasing the risk of developing leukemia. Currently, there are no intervention strategies to prevent leukemia progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 10) combined with functional analysis of samples from patients with RUNX1-FPD (n > 75) revealed that FPD hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) displayed increased myeloid differentiation and suppressed megakaryopoiesis because of increased activation of prosurvival and inflammatory pathways. Bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD contained an elevated cytokine milieu, exerting chronic inflammatory stress on HSPCs. RUNX1-FPD HSPCs were myeloid biased, had increased self-renewal, and were resistant to inflammation-mediated exhaustion. The bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD showed high transcript and protein expression of CD74 at the preleukemic stage compared with that of healthy controls, which remained high upon patient transformation into leukemia. Further, CD74-mediated signaling was exaggerated in RUNX1-FPD HSPCs compared with healthy controls, leading to the activation of mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways with increased cytokine production. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of CD74 with ISO-1 and its downstream targets JAK1/2 and mTOR reversed RUNX1-FPD differentiation defects in vitro and in vivo and reduced inflammation. Our results highlight that inflammation is an early event in RUNX1-FPD pathogenesis, and CD74 signaling is one of the drivers of this inflammation. The repurposing of JAK1/2i (ruxolitinib) and mTORi (sirolimus) and promoting the advancement of CD74 inhibitors in clinical settings as an early intervention strategy would be beneficial to improve the phenotype of patients with RUNX1-FPD and prevent myeloid progression.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with gastrectomy being the primary treatment option. Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, may influence tumor growth by creating an immunosuppressive environment conducive to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Here, the effect of abdominal infection on tumor growth and metastasis was investigated through the implementation of a peritoneal metastasis model and a subcutaneous tumor model. In a murine model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to simulate the effects of sepsis, we observed significant immune dysregulation, including T-cell exhaustion and the release of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). This immune alteration was associated with increased programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression on T cells and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment, fostering an immune-suppressive environment. Polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) expressing elevated PD-L1 after sepsis demonstrated more substantial suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation than controls. Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies successfully restored T-cell function, reduced mortality, and decreased metastasis in CLP mice. These findings emphasize the impact of sepsis on tumor progression and suggest targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a potential therapeutic strategy for managing immune dysfunction in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Natural killer (NK) cells are integral components of the innate immune system, serving a vital function in eliminating virally infected cells. This review highlights the significance of CXCR5+ NK cells in the context of chronic HIV/SIV infection and viral control.


RECENT FINDINGS
Controlled HIV/SHIV infection results in a substantial increase in the population of CXCR5+ NK cells within the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). These CXCR5+ NK cells display enhanced functional characteristics, including elevated expression of activation markers and increased cytokine production, which are essential for effective viral control. These follicular NK cells are shown to be enriched in IL-15 signaling, and CXCR5 NK cells are negatively associated with viral burden during chronic HIV and SHIV infection.


SUMMARY
The distinct phenotypic and functional attributes of CXCR5+ NK cells, particularly in the lymphoid tissues of individuals living with HIV, emphasize their critical contribution to the anti-HIV-1 immune response. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and roles of CXCR5+ NK cells may present novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing NK-mediated viral control.">

 Resident intestinal macrophages play a key role in maintaining gut homeostasis and exhibit a hypoactive tolerogenic phenotype. Recently, several subsets of intestinal macrophages have been identified based on CD11c expression which differ in their inflammatory and functional profiles. Notably, pro-inflammatory CD11c+ monocyte-like macrophages are found elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). These cells are recruited from blood monocytes via the CCR2/CCL2 chemokine pathway. Our study is focused on observing the patterns of CCL2-driven blood monocyte migration and their translation into subsets of intestinal tissue macrophages that can determine the degree of gut inflammation in newly diagnosed patients.



 Patients referred with suspected IBD were seen in an inception clinic. Intestinal biopsies and matched blood samples were obtained from pre-treatment UC and CD patients during their index colonoscopy. Those with inflammation excluded during this procedure formed a ‘non-IBD’ control group. Biopsy segments were cultured to generate conditioned media and also digested for flow cytometry analysis. Plasma concentrations of CCL2 and intestinal secretome were measured using ELISA or Olink proteomic analysis respectively. Efficacy of blood monocyte chemotaxis towards CCL2 was assessed in the presence or absence of CCL2/CCR2 antagonists and the profile of monocyte subsets in whole blood were determined using whole blood flow cytometry analysis.



 As previously described, we observed distinct CD11c+ and CD11c- macrophage populations in IBD intestinal tissue, with expansion of the CD11c+ subset within inflamed regions which expressed higher levels of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1. Higher concentrations of CCL2 were observed in conditioned media from inflamed IBD tissue compared to non-inflamed regions and this correlated with elevated numbers of circulating blood monocytes. Chemotaxis assays revealed a corresponding increase in CCL2-induced monocyte migration in patients with IBD compared to the ‘non-IBD’ control group.



 Our study provides further insights into the role of the CCL2/CCR2 chemokine axis in driving monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into pro-inflammatory intestinal macrophages in IBD. We demonstrate that inflamed intestinal regions exhibit elevated levels of CCL2 correlating with an expansion of the CD11c⁺ macrophage subset and increased CCL2-driven monocyte migration in these subjects. These findings underscore the significance of targeting the CCL2/CCR2 pathway and that it might be an important driver in the development IBD.

        <tr id="Lymph node T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and germinal center (GC) B cells are critical to generate potent antibodies but are rarely possible to study in humans. To understand how Tfh/GC B-cell interactions during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) impact the generation of HIV-specific antibodies, we performed a unique cross-sectional analysis of inguinal lymph node biopsies taken prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in AHI. Although total Tfh and GC B cell frequencies did not change during AHI, increased frequencies of proliferating Th1-like CXCR3+ Tfh, CXCR3+ non-GC B cells, and total CXCR3+ GC B cells correlated with gp120-specific IgG antibody levels in AHI. Frequencies of proliferating CXCR3+ Tfh in AHI also correlated with gp120-specific IgG antibody levels after 48 weeks of ART, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and increased antibody binding to infected cells after ART. Importantly, while beneficial for antibody development, CXCR3+ Tfh cells were also infected by HIV-1 at higher frequencies than their CXCR3- counterparts and may contribute to the initial dissemination of HIV-1 in follicles. Together, these data suggest that activation of CXCR3+ Tfh cells is associated with induction of the germinal center response and subsequent antibody development, making these cells an important target for future therapeutic interventions.


IMPORTANCE
Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is important to limit the seeding of the long-lasting HIV-1 reservoir; however, it also precludes the development of HIV-specific antibodies that can help control the virus if ART is stopped. Antibody development occurs within germinal centers in the lymph node and requires activation of both antigen-specific B cells and T follicular helper cells (Tfh), a specialized CD4+ cell that provides B cell help. To understand how early ART initiation may prohibit antibody development, we analyzed the frequencies and activation status of Tfh and B cells in lymph node biopsies collected in the different stages of acute HIV-1 infection. Our data suggest that decreased antibody development after early ART initiation may be due to limited germinal center development at the time of treatment and that new interventions that target activation of CXCR3+ Tfh may be beneficial to increase long-term HIV-specific antibody levels.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Metastasis is the major cause of cancer‐related mortality. The premetastatic niche is a promising target for its prevention. However, the generality and cellular dynamics in premetastatic niche formation have remained unclear. Aims This study aimed to elucidate the generality and cellular dynamics in premetastatic niche formation. Materials and Methods We performed comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of lung and peripheral immune cells at three time points (early premetastatic, late premetastatic, and micrometastatic phases) for mice with subcutaneous implants of three types of cancer cells (breast cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma cells). The immuno‐cell profiles were then used to predict the metastatic phase by machine learning. Results We found a common pattern of changes in both lung and peripheral immune cell profiles across the three cancer types, including a decrease in the proportion of eosinophils in the early premetastatic phase, an increase in that of regulatory T cells in the late premetastatic phase, and an increase in that of polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and a decrease in that of B cells in the micrometastatic phase. Machine learning using immune cell profiles could predict the metastatic phase with approximately 75% accuracy. Discussion Validation of our findings in humans will require data on the presence or absence of micrometastases in patients and the accumulation of comprehensive and temporal information on immune cells. In addition, blood proteins, extracellular vesicles, DNA, RNA, or metabolites may be useful for more accurate prediction. Conclusion The discovery of generalities in premetastatic niche formation allow prediction of metastatic phase and provide a basis for the development of methods for early detection and prevention of cancer metastasis in a cancer type‐independent manner.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents a unique challenge for researchers due to its late diagnosis caused by vague symptoms and lack of early detection markers. Additionally, PDAC is characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME), making it a difficult tumor to treat. While γδ T cells have shown potential for anti-tumor activity, conflicting studies exist regarding their effectiveness in pancreatic cancer. This study aims to explore the hypothesis that the PDAC TME hinders the anti-tumor capabilities of γδ T cells through blockade of cytotoxic functions. For this reason, we chose to enroll PDAC treatment-naive patients to avoid the possibility of therapy modifying the TME. By flow cytometry, our research findings indicate that the presence of γδ T cells among CD45+ cells in tumor tissue is lower compared to CD66+ cells, but higher than in blood. Circulating Vδ1 T cells exhibit a terminal effector memory phenotype (TEMRA) more than Vδ2 T cells. Interestingly, Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells appear to be more prevalent at different stages of tumor development. In our in vitro culture using conditioned medium derived from Patient-derived organoids ;(PDOs), we observed a shift in expression markers in γδ T cells of healthy individuals toward an activation and exhaustion phenotype, as confirmed by scRNA-seq analysis extracted from a public database. A deeper understanding of γδ T cells in PDAC could be valuable for developing novel therapies aimed at mitigating the impact of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment on this cell population.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the dynamic interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses but their function is dysregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[1-4]. The mechanism that contributes to NK-cell dysregulation in IBD requires further elucidation.



 Using flow cytometry staining, we precisely characterized the frequency, phenotype and function of NK subsets distinguished by CD27 and CD11b in 61 treatment-naive patients with active IBD (including 34 with Crohn’ s disease (CD) and 27 with ulcerative colitis (UC)), as compared to 30 healthy volunteers.



 We observed a significantly increased proportion of the peripheral CD11b-CD27- (double-negative, or DN) NK subsets in IBD patients. Notably, these relatively expanded DN NK subsets exhibited an inactive and immature phenotype. Functional analysis, conducted by stimulating and assessing the expression of CD107a and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), revealed that the DN NK subsets had poor cytotoxic capacity and a deficient potential to produce IFN-γ. In addition, the percentages of DN NK subsets expressing CD107a and IFN-γ were positively correlated with NK degranulation and cytokine production, respectively. Interestingly, we also found that the frequency of DN NK subsets seemed to correlate with the plasma levels of IL-17A. High levels of IL-17A constrain the proliferation and maturation of NK cells in vitro. In some IBD patients who achieved clinical remission after receiving biological agent therapy, the percentage of DN NK subsets decreased accordingly.



 The increased proportion of DN NK subsets may account for NK-cell dysfunction in IBD patients, potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of IL-17A. These alterations in NK cell subsets may contribute to defective killing and thus the secondary infections and increased risk of cancer observed in IBD patients.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has been successfully applied in clinical settings as a standard therapy for many cancer types, but its clinical efficacy is restricted to patients with immunologically hot tumors. Various strategies to modify the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists that can stimulate innate immunity, have been explored but have not been successful. Here, we show a mechanism of acquired resistance to combination treatment consisting of an agonist for multiple TLRs, OK-432 (Picibanil), and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade. Adding the TLR agonist failed to convert the TME from immunogenically cold to hot and did not augment antitumor immunity, particularly CD8+ T cell responses, in multiple animal models. The failure was attributed to the coactivation of innate suppressive cells, such as polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) expressing CXCR2, through high CXCL1 production by macrophages in the TME upon OK-432 treatment. A triple combination treatment with OK-432, PD-1 blockade, and a CXCR2 neutralizing antibody overcame the resistance induced by PMN-MDSCs, resulting in a stronger antitumor effect than that of any dual combinations or single treatments. The accumulation of PMN-MDSCs was similarly observed in the pleural effusions of patients with lung cancer after OK-432 administration. We propose that successful combination cancer immunotherapy intended to stimulate innate antitumor immunity requires modulation of unwanted activation of innate immune suppressive cells, including PMN-MDSCs.">

Hu19-CD828Z, a fully human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with a CD28 costimulatory domain, is engineered to potently deplete B-cells. In this study, we manufactured Hu19-CD828Z CAR T-cells from peripheral blood of SLE, IIM, and SSc patients and healthy donors (HDs). CAR-mediated, CD19-specific activity of these cells was evaluated in vitro by assessing cytotoxicity, cytokine release, and proliferation assays in response to autologous CD19+ B-cells, the CD19+ NALM-6 B-cell line, or a CD19− U937 non-B-cell line as targets. The results demonstrated an increased proliferation of Hu19-CD828Z CAR T-cells and dose-dependent cytotoxicity against primary autologous and NALM-6 B-cells compared to non-transduced controls or co-cultures with non-B-cells. Notably, autoimmune-patient-derived CAR T-cells produced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines than healthy-donor-derived CAR T-cells in response to CD19+ B-cell targets. These data support the potential of Hu19-CD828Z and its therapeutic cell product KYV-101 as a therapeutic strategy to achieve deep B-cell depletion in SLE, IIM, and SSc patients, and highlights its promise for broader application in B-cell-driven autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which coexists as four genetically and immunologically distinct serotypes (DENV-1 to -4). In secondary heterologous DENV infection, pre-existing immunity is believed to contribute to severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Although the elevated pathology observed in ADE conditions has been described, the cell-intrinsic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected by DENV-2 in ADE compared to conventional infection conditions. Unsupervised analysis of scRNAseq data enabled the identification of two distinct cell populations in a heterogeneous cell culture, likely representing infected and bystander/uninfected cells. Differential gene expression and ingenuity pathway analyses revealed a number of significantly upregulated and downregulated genes and gene networks between cells infected by ADE compared to conventional infection. Specifically, these pathways indicated mechanisms such as suppressed interferon signaling and inflammatory chemokine transcription in cells infected via ADE. Further analysis revealed that transcriptomic changes were independent of viral RNA within infected cells, suggesting that the observed changes are reflective of cell-intrinsic responses and not simply a function of per-cell viral burden. The interpreted "bystander" cell population also demonstrated distinct profiles in ADE conditions, indicating an immunologically activated phenotype enriched for the expression of gene networks involved with protein translation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Together, these findings support the concept that DENV infection via ADE induces a qualitatively different transcriptomic response in infected cells, contributing to our understanding of ADE as a mechanistic driver of disease and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCEDengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen with a significant and growing global health burden. Although correlates of severe dengue disease are poorly understood, pre-existing immunity to DENV has been associated with severe disease risk and known to contribute to an alternative route of viral entry termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic processes involved in antibody-mediated DENV entry compared to conventional receptor-mediated entry. These data provide meaningful insight into the discrete processes contributing to DENV pathogenesis in ADE conditions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cisplatin is a platinum-based drug that is frequently used to treat multiple tumors. The anti-tumor effect of cisplatin is closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which includes several immune cell types, such as the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), dendritic cells (DCs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and natural killer (NK) cells. The interaction between these immune cells can promote tumor survival and chemoresistance, and decrease the efficacy of cisplatin monotherapy. Therefore, various combination treatment strategies have been devised to enhance patient responsiveness to cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin can augment anti-tumor immune responses in combination with immune checkpoint blockers (such as PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA4 inhibitors), lipid metabolism disruptors (like FASN inhibitors and SCD inhibitors) and nanoparticles (NPs), resulting in better outcomes. Exploring the interaction between cisplatin and the TIME will help identify potential therapeutic targets for improving the treatment outcomes in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Treatment strategies for Crohn's disease (CD) suppress diverse inflammatory pathways but many patients remain refractory to treatment. Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is an emerging therapy for medically refractory CD though the mechanisms through which it circumvents refractory pathophysiology are unknown.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to understand how the immune system reconstitutes post-SCT and whether SCT may function as a cellular therapy restoring appropriately responsive immune cell populations from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).


DESIGN
Adults with CD with active clinical and endoscopic disease who failed available medical therapies were enrolled in a phase II study of SCT for refractory CD (n=19). Blood and intestinal samples were collected longitudinally and analysed using CyTOF and scRNA-seq. Stem cell autografts were functionally assayed in mouse xenograft models.


RESULTS
scRNA-seq and CyTOF analyses reveal that SCT predominantly affected the intestinal myeloid lineage with loss of inflammatory populations and return of macrophages capable of supporting mucosal healing. Xenograft models using patient HSCs suggested that HSCs support the early reconstitution of the myeloid lineage and reveal an impairment of short and long-term HSC engraftment that may determine SCT outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests SCT functions as a myeloid-directed cellular therapy reinforcing the critical role of macrophages in refractory CD pathophysiology and as a target for cellular therapies. Furthermore, we report an unrecognised functional heterogeneity among HSC subpopulations in CD that may be relevant to our understanding of CD treatment and pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerged as critical contributors to the pathogenesis of vascular endothelial barrier dysfunction during the inflammatory response to infection. However, the contribution of circulating EVs to modifying endothelial function during dengue virus infection remains unclear. In this study, we showed that severe dengue patients' plasma-derived EV (SD-EV) were found to carry elevated levels of different protein cargos, e.g., immunoregulatory proteins (PD-L1, CD44). Further, we demonstrated that SD-EV induces PD-1 and CD44 expression on CD4+ T cells. SD-EV-modulated CD4+ T (SD-EV-CD4) cells released secretome delayed endothelial cell (EC) migration, arrested them in the G1 phase, and augmented the expression of PD-L1 and ICAM-1 expression on EC through the Notch signaling pathway. Blocking SD-EV and CD4+ T-cell interaction through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway partially rescued the CD4+ T cell's effect on EC but did not alter ICAM-1 expression on EC. We observed that the ICAM-1 expression on EC and hyaluronic acid (HA) release from EC was mediated by CD44, which was elevated on SD-EV-modulated CD4+ T cells (SD-EV-CD4), indicating a permeability defect. Blocking of CD44 on SD-EV-CD4 significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression on EC. Further, depletion of specific cytokines, e.g., TNF-α and not IFN-γ from the SD-EV-CD4 secretome, reduced ICAM-1 expression, decreased transendothelial electrical resistance, and induced apoptosis on EC significantly. Treatment with NF-kB inhibitor before secretome addition to EC reduced ICAM-1 expression on EC. In conclusion, we provided evidence that SD-EV-CD4 carrying PD-1 and CD44, when interacting with EC, significantly affected endothelial cell properties and may be significant in dengue-mediated endothelial dysfunction.IMPORTANCEExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane vesicles secreted into biological fluids, including plasma from living cells, holding insights into pathological processes. Studying EVs under pathological conditions is extremely important as they play a selective role in intercellular communication and modulation of immune response under diverse pathological conditions. However, there is less clarity on how circulatory extracellular vesicles influence immune cells during dengue virus (DV) infection and impact pathogenesis. Our present study highlights the impact of severe dengue patients' plasma-derived EV (SD-EV) on CD4+ T cells and together induce endothelial barrier dysfunction. We provided evidence that SD-EV induces PD-1 and CD44 on CD4+ T cells and, when interacting with endothelial cells (EC), drives endothelial damage through direct interaction or secretome and may be significant in dengue-mediated endothelial dysfunction.">

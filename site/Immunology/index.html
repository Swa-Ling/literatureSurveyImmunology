        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Advanced melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that has spread and cannot be surgically removed. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for some patients by helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. However, reliable methods to predict which patients will benefit are still lacking. This study investigated whether analyzing both tumor and blood samples before treatment could help identify patients most likely to benefit from ICIs. By studying gene activity in tumors and immune cell types in the blood, we found that patients with low immune activity in their tumors had poorer outcomes. Conversely, those with higher levels of a specific immune cell type in their blood—PD-1+ effector memory CD4+ T-cell—tended to respond better to treatment. These findings suggest that combining both tumor and blood analysis could support more personalized and effective treatment decisions for patients with advanced melanoma.">

        <tr id="Negative regulators of T cell function represent promising targets to enhance the intrinsic antitumor activity of CAR T cells against solid tumors. However, the endogenous immune ecosystem in solid tumors often represents an immunosuppressive therapeutic barrier to CAR T cell therapy, and it is currently unknown whether deletion of negative regulators in CAR T cells reshapes the endogenous immune landscape. To address this knowledge gap, we developed CAR T cells targeting B7-H3 in immune-competent osteosarcoma models and evaluated the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of deleting a potent negative regulator called Regnase-1 (Reg-1). Deletion of Reg-1 not only improved the effector function of B7-H3-CAR T cells but also endowed them with the ability to create a proinflammatory landscape characterized by an influx of IFNγ-producing endogenous T cells and NK cells and a reduction of inhibitory myeloid cells, including M2 macrophages. Thus, deleting negative regulators in CAR T cells enforces a non-cell-autonomous state by creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Although effective for immunologically hot tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors minimally affect tumors that are not T cell inflamed, including breast cancer. An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage. In summary, we describe a class of neutrophils, educated by the combined action of inflammatory mediators and metabolic inhibitors, having tumoricidal functions.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess strong immunomodulatory properties, making them attractive candidates for regenerative medicine and immune-related therapies. Pre-activation, or licensing, of MSCs with cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) has been shown to enhance their immunosuppressive efficacy. Recent attention has turned to extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by licensed MSCs as a cell-free therapeutic alternative. Methods Small EVs were isolated from MSCs licensed with a combination of IFN-γ and TGF-β1. These EVs were characterized according to standardized criteria. Their immunomodulatory effects were assessed in vitro using two human immune models: a THP-1-derived macrophage polarization system and a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) co-culture assay. Pro/anti-inflammatory molecules secretion, T cell proliferation, and regulatory T cell induction were quantified. Dimensionality reduction using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was applied to multiparametric flow cytometry data for immune profiling. In addition, publicly available transcriptomic datasets (GSE122091 and GSE46019) were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IFN-γ– and TGF-β1–licensed MSCs, providing insight into potential molecular drivers of EV-mediated immunoregulation. Results Licensed EVs significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory THP-1 macrophage activation and promoted an anti-inflammatory phenotype, with reduced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), increased IL-10 production, and decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels.. Compared to EVs from non-licensed MSCs, licensed EVs induced a greater proportion of regulatory T cells and exhibited enhanced suppression of allogeneic T cell proliferation. t-SNE analysis revealed a distinct immunoregulatory signature induced by licensed EVs, characterized by the emergence of a non-proliferative lymphocyte subset with elevated co-expression of CD4, CD25, and FOXP3. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed seven overlapping DEGs between IFN-γ– and TGF-β1–licensed MSCs, including both upregulated (GPR68, LIMK2, LIPG) and downregulated (EFNA5, PRKG1, DCLK1, TRIM2) genes, several of which are functionally implicated in EV-mediated immune regulation. Conclusions Small EVs derived from IFN-γ and TGF-β1-licensed MSCs exhibit demonstrate dose-dependent immunomodulatory trends in vitro, with enhanced effects observed at higher concentrations.. These findings suggest their potential utility in modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses, warranting further investigation for their application as a cell-free therapeutic strategy in immune-mediated conditions.

        <tr id="The autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc) presents with multiple organ manifestations that often complicate management strategies. To explore variations in immune cell subsets and their link to clinical heterogeneity, here we perform single-cell profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 SSc patients who never received immunosuppressive therapy. We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression. Thus, our single-cell analysis reveals distinct immune cell abnormalities associated with clinical organ manifestations, providing insights into tailored treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Background Early administration of IL-6R blockade is effective in adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD), but the underlying immune alterations during combined immunotherapy remain unclear. Methods We employed high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and an unbiased bioinformatics pipeline to characterize the immune landscape in treatment-naïve AOSD patients, stable AOSD patients after 24 weeks of IL-6R blockade plus methotrexate and prednisone, and matched healthy controls. Cytokine profiling was conducted using a high-throughput cytometric bead array, and potential regulatory networks were identified using the PerformanceAnalytics package. Validation was performed via flow cytometry and mRNA sequencing. Results We identified 22 peripheral immune cell populations and characterized their composition and phenotypic markers. Treatment-naïve AOSD patients exhibited significant depletion of CD4+ T cells and B cells, along with excessive activation of CD8+ T cells and a previously unreported CD45+CD3−CD19−CD10−CD66a+ population, findings that were validated in an independent AOSD cohort. mRNA sequencing revealed the proinflammatory role of CD8+ T cells. Notably, these dysregulated immune profiles were markedly restored following immunotherapy. IL-18, IL-21, and IFN-γ demonstrated strong associations with adaptive immune cells and AOSD clinical indices. Conclusions Combined IL-6R blockade effectively modulates immune dysregulation in refractory AOSD, reversing key pathological immune alterations and highlighting its therapeutic potential.

        <tr id="Although lung myeloid cells provide an intracellular niche for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), CD4+ T cells limit Mtb growth in these cells to protect the host. The CD4+ T cell activities including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production that account for this protection are poorly understood. Using intravenous antibody labeling and lineage-tracing reporter mice, we show that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), rather than phenotypically similar monocytes or dendritic cells, are preferentially infected with Mtb in murine lungs. MDMs were recruited to the lungs by Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells via IFN-γ, which promoted the extravasation of monocyte precursors from the blood. It was possible that CD4+ T cells recruited infectable MDMs because these cells are uniquely poised to receive cognate MHCII-mediated help to control intracellular bacteria. Mice with MHCII deficiency in monocyte-derived cells had normal Mtb-specific CD4+ T cell activation, expansion and differentiation but the CD4+ T cells were unable to attenuate Mtb growth. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we showed that MDMs receiving cognate MHCII-mediated help from CD4+ T cells upregulated glycolytic genes associated with Mtb control. Overall, the results indicate that CD4+ T cells recruit infectable MDMs to the lungs and then trigger glycolysis-dependent bacterial control in the MDMs by engaging their MHCII-bound Mtb peptides. Moreover, the results suggest that cognate MHCII-mediated help to promote MDM glycolysis is an essential, IFN-γ-independent effector function of Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a lethal manifestation of acute lung injury, remains a critical public health concern due to the absence of targeted therapies. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for immunopathology during DAD progression are largely undefined. Here, by integrating single cell RNA sequencing, functional assays, and genetic/pharmacological interventions in a mouse model of ricin-induced DAD, we revealed a significant accumulation of neutrophil with an activated phenotype that plays a critical role in immunopathology. We observed the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during DAD, which further intensified inflammation and tissue injury. IL-17A signaling activity was upregulated in DAD-affected lungs, while IL-17A deficiency or functional blockade significantly attenuated neutrophil recruitment, NET generation, and tissue damage. Mechanically, IL-17A stimulates lung resident fibroblasts to produce the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1. Notably, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) emerged as the dominant source of IL-17A, highlighting a triad of interactions among ILC3, fibroblast, and neutrophil in DAD pathogenesis. This finding delineates a pathogenic IL-17A-neutrophil-NET axis that amplifies lung immunopathology after ricin-induced DAD, a deeper understanding of these relationships may pave the way for mitigate DAD immunopathology and other lung inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Eosinophils are agile cells that participate in a multitude of homeostatic and inflammatory responses in the lung, ranging from allergic asthma to antiviral defense against respiratory viral infection. In the context of vaccination followed by viral infection, such as breakthrough infection, eosinophils have been linked to aberrant Th2 responses like vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). Here, we demonstrate that the lung immune cell composition, cytokine and chemokine repertoire, histopathological profile, and systemic humoral response of breakthrough influenza infection in mice is distinct from that of primary influenza infection or allergic sensitization, canonical Type 1 and 2 immune responses, respectively. Longitudinal comparison of breakthrough infection with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection demonstrated major differences in lung immunity between treatment groups in female, BALB/c mice. Breakthrough infection mice exhibit lung eosinophil infiltration that peaks at 7-10 days post-challenge, enriched for the Siglec-Fhi subset, but in the absence of overt pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine signals, high viral titers, severe lung lesions, goblet cell hyperplasia, allergic levels of total IgE, or enhanced morbidity. Multiparameter fluorescence imaging corroborated findings from flow cytometry and also unveiled interactions between CD101+Siglec-F+ cells with CD3+ cells in the lung tissue space. Imaging also revealed a marked absence of eosinophil or neutrophil extracellular traps in the lungs of breakthrough infection mice, in contrast with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection, respectively. Altogether, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the kinetics and cell-cell interplay during non-pathological, balanced Type 1/2 immune responses in vaccinated hosts during breakthrough infection.">

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis is recognized as a common and severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus, without an optimal therapeutic strategy currently available. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold therapeutic promise, their efficacy varies substantially, likely due to their plasticity and capacity to adopt pro-inflammatory (MSC1) or anti-inflammatory (MSC2) functional states in response to different microenvironments. Here, we report for the first time that IL-27, via JAK1–STAT1 signaling, up-regulates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in MSCs, driving MSC differentiation toward an IDO-positive MSC2 phenotype with low immunogenicity. These IDO-positive MSC2 cells produce kynurenine and kynurenic acid, the metabolites of tryptophan, which bind to the intracellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This interaction stimulates an increase in the anti-inflammatory factor TSG-6 and induces the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Notably, IL-27-conditioned MSC2 demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy compared to conventional MSCs in a murine lupus nephritis model. In conclusion, this study revealed that IL-27 is a critical modulator of MSC immune plasticity and presented a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing IL-27-enhanced MSC2 for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing worldwide, and although kidney transplantation improves survival, long-term graft loss–driven mainly by immune-mediated rejection–remains common. We aimed to delineate immune mechanisms that distinguish recipients with stable versus impaired graft function. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from kidney-transplant recipients with normal (n = 10) or impaired (n = 10) renal function were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing. Fourteen immune populations were identified; CD4+ T-cell “stemness” was quantified using mRNAsi and EREG_mRNAsi indices, lineage trajectories were reconstructed with Monocle, and ligand–receptor communication was inferred with iTalk. Findings were validated in an independent bulk RNA-seq cohort (n = 192) using differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Results Recipients with graft dysfunction exhibited (i) expansion of Th17 cells and contraction of Treg cells, (ii) significant loss of CD4+ T-cell stem-like features (lower mRNAsi/EREG_mRNAsi, p < 0.001), and (iii) pseudotime trajectories skewed toward Th17 differentiation. iTalk revealed enhanced S100A8/A9-TLR4 signalling from myeloid cells to neutrophils, consistent with reduced circulating neutrophils and presumptive intragraft accumulation. Bulk validation confirmed the stemness deficit and identified eight hub genes (API5, CAPRIN1, CCT2, DLG1, NMD3, RDX, SENP7, S100A4) that correlated with both low stemness and poor clinical outcome. Pathway enrichment implicated cell-morphogenesis, tight-junction, and metabolic-homeostasis pathways in graft injury. Discussion Integrative single-cell and bulk analyses link diminished CD4+ T-cell stemness, Th17-dominant polarization, and S100A4-mediated neutrophil recruitment to graft dysfunction. These signatures nominate stemness indices, Th17/Treg balance, and the S100-TLR4 axis as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets to preserve allograft integrity and prolong transplant survival.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play dual roles in cancer, either promoting or suppressing tumor progression, complicating therapeutic approaches. TAMs include recruited macrophages (recMacs), derived from circulating monocytes, and tissue-resident interstitial macrophages (IMs). We recently identified a heterogeneous population of chemokine-expressing IMs, including subsets that support tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation during lung inflammation. Here, we show that IMs can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic, depending on the subset. Using Pf4ᶜʳᵉCx3cr1ᴰᵀᴿ mice to deplete CD206hi IMs expressing Cxcl13, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, we demonstrate their essential role in TLS formation, lymphocyte recruitment, and tumor suppression in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Ccl2-expressing IMs promote tumor growth by recruiting pro-tumorigenic recMacs. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the distinct localization and chemokine profiles of these subsets. Finally, CCR5 blockade with the FDA-approved inhibitor Maraviroc during neoantigen vaccination improved tumor control by preventing the migration of immunosuppressive, antigen-presenting recMacs (moDCs). These findings support the development of macrophage-targeted therapies by identifying pro-tumorigenic subsets and recMac trafficking as actionable targets, while preserving macrophage populations that sustain anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an effective treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, yet the mechanisms underlying immune reset and sustained remission remain incompletely understood. This study provides a longitudinal immune profiling of patients undergoing AHSCT, with a specific focus on immune reconstitution at two years post-AHSCT.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at baseline and multiple time points post-AHSCT. Immune reconstitution was characterized using high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to assess phenotypic changes in B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells.AHSCT led to profound alterations in immune cell populations. B-cell recovery was marked by a rapid expansion of naïve B cells, while memory B cells and plasmablasts remained depleted. Notably, patients with evidence of inflammatory disease activity (EIDA) post-AHSCT exhibited higher pre-transplant frequencies of non-switched IgD+IgM+ memory B cells, raising the possibility of a potential biomarker for treatment response. Myeloid-cell reconstitution showed a decline in classical monocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially shifting the immune balance toward a more tolerogenic state. CD4 T-cell reconstitution demonstrated a shift from central memory (Tcm) to effector memory (Tem) phenotypes, with a selective depletion of polyfunctional Th1/Th17cells lacking PD-1 expression. Clusters enriched for PD-1+ Tem CD4 T cells appeared to differ between patients with and without EIDA. Furthermore, an increase in atypical naïve CCR7⁻CD62L⁻ CD4 T cells was observed in EIDA patients, raising questions about their role in the pathophysiology of MS. CD8 T-cell reconstitution followed a similar pattern, with a shift from a naïve/Tcm-dominant to a Tem-skewed population, albeit with substantial interpatient variability. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells showed a sustained decrease, possibly reflecting microbiota alterations post-transplant.Taken together, these findings provide an exploratory characterization of immune reconstitution following AHSCT, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms that warrant validation in larger cohorts to guide patient stratification and monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in immuno-oncology research have revolutionised our understanding of the interplay between immune cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME), profoundly impacting patient responses to therapy. The TME, comprising tumour cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and co-existing microbes, orchestrates the immune phenotype of cancers, shaping disease progression and treatment outcomes. Immune-cell infiltration serves as a significant prognostic marker in various cancers, with higher rates correlating with improved prognosis. Recent discoveries have paved the way for immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which exhibit remarkable efficacy across multiple cancer types. However, understanding the nuanced contributions of different immune-cell populations to therapeutic responses remains a challenge. The majority of research has focussed on the role of T cells in the immune response to cancer therapies, with the potential importance of B cells only recently being recognised. Here, we review the diverse phenotypes of B cells within the TME, their structural organisation within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and the role of both B cells and TLS in cancer prognosis and response to different therapies for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered immune cells, particularly CAR T lymphocytes and CAR natural killer (NK) cells, have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, their therapeutic efficacy and safety can be influenced by the tumor microenvironment, particularly the presence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are immunomodulatory cells which can alter the function of tumor-infiltrated immune cells in both supportive and suppressive ways. Results obtained in recently conducted experimental studies demonstrate that MSCs modulate proliferation, cytotoxicity, cytokine production and anti-tumor activity in CAR-expressing immune cells in both a juxtacrine and a paracrine manner. While MSCs can enhance CAR cell viability and persistence through trophic support, they may also impair cytotoxic function and promote an immunosuppressive phenotype under certain conditions. Understanding the dualistic nature of MSCs in CAR-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases is critical for optimizing clinical outcomes. Additionally, MSCs may serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of immunomodulatory agents, and should be considered as active components in the design of next-generation CAR-based immunotherapies. Accordingly, in this review article we emphasize molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in MSC-dependent modulation of CAR-expressing immune cells, paving the way for more efficient CAR-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases.">

        <tr id="Polytrauma with significant bone and volumetric muscle loss presents substantial clinical challenges. Although immune responses significantly influence fracture healing post-polytrauma, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation require further investigation. While previous studies examined either injury site tissue or systemic tissue (peripheral blood), our study uniquely investigated both systemic and local immune cells at the same time to better understand polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation and associated impaired bone healing. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a rat polytrauma model, we analyzed blood, bone marrow, and the local defect soft tissue to identify potential cellular and molecular targets involved in immune dysregulation. We identified a trauma-associated immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cell population that drives systemic immune dysregulation, immunosuppression, and potentially impaired bone healing. We found CD1d as a global marker for TIM cells in polytrauma. In the local defect tissue, we observed Spp1+ monocytes/macrophages mediating inflammatory, fibrotic, and impaired adaptive immune responses. Finally, our findings highlighted increased signaling via Anxa1-Fpr2 and Spp1-Cd44 axes. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of immune dysregulation-mediated nonunion following traumatic injury and provides biomarkers that could function as treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Background: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to immune suppression observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are hijacked during development and further reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment (TME) to harbor immune-suppressive properties and inhibit T-cell functions. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, including BRD4, are epigenetic modulators that regulate genes implicated in CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions. Previously, we investigated how the novel BET inhibitor OPN-51107 (OPN5) prevents CLL disease expansion, modulates T-cell immune function, and alters gene expression related to MDSCs. In turn, we hypothesize that BET proteins such as BRD4 regulate MDSC functions, and subsequent pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 will alleviate MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL. Methods: Utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, we evaluated BRD4 protein expression in MDSCs derived from the bone marrow of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. We then investigated the ex vivo functionality of OPN5-treated MDSCs, expanded from Eµ-TCL1 and WT bone marrow in MDSC-supportive medium. Finally, we conducted an in vivo study utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model to determine the in vivo effects of OPN5 on MDSCs and other immune populations. Results: Through the course of this study, we found that MDSCs isolated from Eμ-TCL1 mice upregulate BRD4 expression and are more immune-suppressive than their WT counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrated ex vivo OPN5 treatment reverses the immune-suppressive capacity of MDSCs isolated from leukemic mice, evident via enhanced T-cell proliferation and IFNγ production. Finally, we showed in vivo OPN5 treatment slows CLL disease progression and modulates immune cell populations, including MDSCs. Conclusions: Altogether, these data support BET inhibition as a useful therapeutic approach to reverse MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL.">

        <tr id="Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), a B-cell lymphoma in cattle. Previous studies have demonstrated that T cells of BLV-infected cattle show increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules, including programmed death-1 (PD-1), lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), leading to T-cell exhaustion. However, the key immune checkpoint molecules driving T-cell exhaustion in BLV-induced tumorigenesis remained unclear. In this study, we identified the key immune checkpoint molecules by performing comprehensive flow cytometric analyses of T cells from EBL cattle, and elucidated the phenotype and function of exhausted T cells using a transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing and cell culture assays. The comprehensive expression analysis revealed that the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressing PD-1 and TIM-3 was significantly increased in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of EBL cattle compared to healthy cattle. Transcriptomic analysis of PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells revealed the upregulation of genes related to terminal exhaustion and the downregulation of genes related to T-cell differentiation and response in this subset. Additionally, PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells exhibited higher expression of CTLA-4, LAG-3, and Eomes, and lower expression of T-bet, suggesting a terminally exhausted phenotype. Cell culture assays revealed a significant impairment in IFN-γ production in PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells upon stimulation, reflecting severe dysfunction. These findings indicate that PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells play a central role in T-cell exhaustion during BLV-induced tumorigenesis. This study provides valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies against BLV infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent and deadly disease that is largely refractory to immunotherapy. The only CRC subset that responds to these therapies is characterized by prevalent microsatellite instability (MSI), extensive  CD8+ T cell infiltration and high expression of innate immune signaling pathways. Endogenous activation of the cGAS/STING pathway is essential for this CD8+ T cell antitumor response in MSI CRCs, suggesting that activating it in other CRCs could boost immunotherapy response rates. In contrast, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is typically associated with tumor-promoting inflammation although this has primarily been studied in immune cells. Methods We used a mixture of flow cytometry, activation assays, in vivo orthotopic models and patient-derived organoids to investigate the effect of NLRP3 activation in CRC cells on cGAS/STING-mediated antitumor immunity. Results Our results show that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome specifically in CRC cells boosts cGAS/STING signaling in both MSI and non-MSI CRCs and that dual stimulation increases CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. The ability of NLRP3 to enhance cGAS/STING signaling was specific and did not occur with activation of other innate immune pathways such as AIM2 or TLRs. Enhancement of cGAS/STING signaling by NLRP3 proceeded via a positive feedback loop that was inflammasome-independent and required early crosstalk between the signaling mediators and regulation of their gene expression. Conclusions Activation of NLRP3 specifically in CRC cells could be a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity in otherwise immunotherapy resistant CRCs.

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1, Nur77) plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell metabolism and function within the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus influencing cancer progression and serving as a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. A comprehensive review discussing the multifaceted roles of NR4A1 in immune cells and the exploitation of that knowledge for therapeutic development is lacking in the field. This review explores diverse functions of NR4A1 in tumor-associated immune cells, including T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. NR4A1 contributes to immune regulation by impacting cytokine production, cell differentiation, and immune cell exhaustion. We highlight how NR4A1 in immune cells within the TME may be either a positive (e.g., macrophages in colon cancer) or negative prognostic factor (e.g., T cells in melanoma), depending on the cancer and immune cell context. Additionally, this review also highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting NR4A1, leading to its inhibition, activation, or degradation to restore immune cell function and enhance anti-tumor immunity. Such therapies could potentially improve patient outcomes by altering immune cell behaviors, blocking intrinsic tumor growth pathways, or via both mechanisms. However, the development of NR4A1-targeted therapies will be dependent on further research to better understand lineage-specific roles of NR4A1 and the underlying mechanisms across different cancer types and immune cells.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits profound molecular heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features that limit therapeutic efficacy. This review elucidates the dual roles of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC progression. TLS, ectopic lymphoid organs formed under chronic inflammation, correlate with improved survival and immunotherapy sensitivity by fostering effector T/B cell interactions and antigen presentation. Conversely, immunosuppressive TME components like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) drive immune evasion via cytokine-mediated suppression and checkpoint activation (PD-1/PD-L1). CD8+ T cells exert context-dependent effects, with high infiltration reducing recurrence risk but paradoxically inducing exhaustion in PD-L1-rich microenvironments. Th17 and memory T cells further modulate disease through IL-17-driven angiogenesis and CD45RO+ immune memory dynamics. Multi-omics-based TLS scoring and combinatorial therapies emerge as promising strategies to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the gut microbiome has been recognized as one influential factor in cancer development. Particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC), several studies observed a major imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, marked by a reduction in beneficial bacterial species, such as Roseburia intestinalis, and an increase in opportunistic pathobionts, like Peptostreptococcus stomatis. We previously observed that specific Eubacteriales, including R. intestinalis, were significantly reduced in CRC patients and have a potent anti-tumor immune effect when applied as oral monotherapy in mice. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of R. intestinalis on various cell types in vitro, highlighting its potential therapeutic value in CRC. Co-culture experiments with macrophages demonstrated that R. intestinalis exposure induced an increase in the M1 phenotype and decreased the M2 phenotype, suggesting macrophage-polarizing properties of these bacteria. R. intestinalis also triggered a gene expression profile resembling M1 macrophages and led to distinct chemokine and cytokine secretion in cancer cells, suggesting an immune-activating environment. However, we did not observe direct cytotoxic effects in cancer cells. Our research provides insights into the potential of R. intestinalis to activate immune responses, supporting further investigation into its therapeutic role in CRC. These findings underscore the need for deeper studies on the bacterium’s impact on CRC pathogenesis and treatment.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

However, the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate sterilizing immunity against latent infection remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry to characterize the immune dynamics and cellular architecture of cryptococcal granulomas. Using fate mapping and murine genetic tools, we demonstrate that alternative activation of monocyte-derived myeloid cells by CD4+ T helper 2 cells antagonizes pulmonary fungal clearance during latent infection. In contrast to the prevailing view in the field, we find that alternatively activated myeloid cells are not an intrinsic replication niche for the fungus and more broadly, Cryptococcus predominantly resides in the extracellular environment. We propose a T helper 2 cell-myeloid circuit establishes a local immunosuppressive environment to drive extracellular fungal persistence, which could be leveraged as a new target for host-directed therapy to treat latent fungal infections.">

        <tr id="Objective Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by high clinical heterogeneity and complex immunopathological mechanisms. Immune dysregulation plays a central role in its progression. This study aims to investigate the compositional changes of immune cells, characteristics of intercellular communication, and potential regulatory mechanisms of N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in sepsis, with a particular focus on the functional remodeling of platelets. Methods This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE167363 dataset) from sepsis patients with m6A methylation sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Through systematic analysis, we compared the differences in immune cell composition, developmental trajectories, intercellular communication, and m6A modifications among healthy controls, survivors, and non-survivors, and further screened for key m6A-regulated target genes. Results The analysis revealed that platelets gradually accumulated during the progression of sepsis, while B cells, T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibited a trend toward platelet-like phenotypic remodeling. Cell–cell communication analysis showed a marked decline in communication strength among immune cells as the disease worsened, particularly a significant weakening of the APP–CD74 signaling pathway between platelets and B cells, indicating impaired immune network synergy. m⁶A methylation sequencing revealed distinct remodeling of m⁶A peaks and dysregulation of related regulatory factors in non-survivors. Further integrative analysis identified RPA1 as a key m⁶A-regulated target gene, whose expression was closely associated with APP and co-regulated by multiple m6A-modifying factors. Conclusion This study reveals disruptions in immune cell interactions and an m6A-dependent mechanism of platelet functional remodeling during sepsis progression. The identification of the key target gene RPA1 offers new insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of sepsis and lays a theoretical foundation for future precision interventions and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Unresolved inflammation and fibrosis are the two key features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of steatotic liver disease that can evolve into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although innate immunity has been well studied in MASH, the role of CD4⁺ T cells remains underexplored despite their potential to coordinate immune responses by providing help to other immune cells, promoting inflammation, or regulating immune activity through effector and regulatory subsets. To better understand the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MASH, we comprehensively characterized hepatic CD4+ T cells in murine and human MASH at a single-cell protein, transcriptional, and functional level. Mass cytometry and CITE-sequencing revealed a marked shift in intrahepatic CD4⁺ T-cell composition in MASH, with enrichment of Th1, regulatory, and cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells. Similar phenotypic changes were mirrored in the peripheral blood and validated in human MASH samples. Functional assays demonstrated increased production of IFNγ and TNFα by hepatic CD4⁺ T cells, highlighting their proinflammatory effector activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified Tnfrsf4 (OX40) upregulation in hepatic CD4⁺ T cells during MASH. Therapeutic blockade of the OX40L-OX40 axis reversed hepatic fibrosis and improved histologic disease scores in mice with established MASH, and also decreased inflammatory markers in a human ex vivo liver model. Together, these studies provide a proteogenomic single-cell atlas for hepatic CD4⁺ T cells and uncover a CD4⁺ T cell-dependent immunopathogenic circuit as a promising immunotherapeutic target to alleviate MASH and liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies represent a promising approach for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse, yet their efficacy is hindered by immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the tumor microenvironment. This study investigated the effects of TGF-β on NK cell cytotoxicity and migration using 2D and 3D co-culture models that mimic the leukemic microenvironment. Methods TGF-β production was evaluated in AML-derived leukemic cell lines and mesenchymal stromal cells (hTERT-MSCs) using ELISA. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to analyze global gene expression changes in TGF-β-treated primary human NK cells. NK cell cytotoxicity and migration were assessed in 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid co-cultures containing hTERT-MSCs and leukemic cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results Both leukemic cells and MSCs produced TGF-β, with increased levels observed in MSCs after co-culture with primary AML blasts. RNA sequencing revealed that TGF-β altered key gene pathways associated with NK cell cytotoxicity, adhesion, and migration, supporting its immunosuppressive role. In functional assays, TGF-β exposure significantly reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner and impaired NK cell infiltration into 3D spheroids, particularly in models incorporating MSCs. Additionally, MSCs themselves provided a protective environment for leukemic cells, further reducing NK cell effectiveness in 2D co-cultures. Conclusion TGF-β suppresses both NK cell cytotoxicity and migration, limiting their ability to eliminate leukemic cells and infiltrate the bone marrow niche (BMN). These findings provide novel insights into TGF-β–mediated immune evasion mechanisms and provide important insights for the future design of NK-based immunotherapies and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia and decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, it can be either congenital or acquired, predominantly affecting adolescents and the elderly, with higher incidence in Asia compared to Europe and America. Current treatment options include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppressive agents, yet proximately a third of patients fail to reach long-term survival. AA is primarily driven by immune-mediated destruction of HSPCs, initiated by self-activated T cells. Early stages feature a Th1 response, which later shifts to Th17 and effector memory CD8+ T cells. Key cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) play crucial roles in this immune dysregulation, influencing HSPCs and contributing to bone marrow failure. Furthermore, bone marrow macrophages (MΦ), particularly M1 subtype, are implicated in AA via the TNF-α/TNF-α receptor pathway, leading to T cell activating and subsequent HSPC damage. Interestingly, MΦ with high expression of IL-27Ra have been demonstrated to contribute to HSPC destruction in AA murine models. Beyond their role in thrombosis, platelets also participate in immune regulation. Some studies suggest that platelet may modulate T cell responses through mechanisms such as Akt-PGC1α-TFAM pathway or PF4-mediated activity, which could play a role in AA. However, direct evidence connecting platelet regulation to T cell-mediated HSPC damage is limited, and current research has largely focuses on CD8+ T cells. Moving forward, it is essential to investigate the interactions between platelets, CD4+ T cells, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In this review, we propose that platelet-derived factors such as PF4 and TGFβ may activate mitochondrial pathways, influencing T cell activation and leading to HSPC destruction in AA. This hypothesis could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AA and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies (Highlight).">

T cells provide multifaceted support to NK cell-mediated responses. Here, we aimed to design a novel CD19-targeted CAR-NK, engineered with secreted interleukin-15 and C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (ie, 15×21 CAR-NK), capable of recruiting and cooperating with T cells. Methods We characterized 15×21 CAR-NK cells by performing experiments in vitro and in mouse models, and conducting RNA sequencing. Results 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibit strong capabilities in cytotoxicity, cytokine production, effector molecule expression, and T-cell recruitment in vitro. Cooperation with T cells promoted efficient tumor-cell elimination, alleviated mutual exhaustion phenotypes, and enhanced the expression of effector molecules/receptors. The recruitment and cooperative effects also result in effective tumor control in mouse models. In addition, 15×21 CAR-NK cells strongly enrich the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway - a key intracellular signaling cascade that is associated with enhanced downstream pro-survival signaling, anti-apoptotic ability, mitochondrial function, and cytotoxicity. Conclusions Our study highlights the intrinsic advantages and extrinsic T-cell cooperative benefits of 15×21 CAR-NK cells, providing a promising strategy for NK-cell-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical sentinels of the immune system, serving as indispensable bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs are a heterogeneous population, with subsets playing specialized roles in immune defense, tolerance, or disease development. Among these, the recently redefined DC3 subset has gained attention for its unique features and potential roles in health and disease. This review focuses on the phenotypic, functional, and developmental diversity of DC subsets—primarily DC3s—and their contributions to cancer. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors is characterized by varying degrees of immune cell infiltration, including DCs. Within the TME, DCs play diverse roles, either promoting anti-tumor responses or facilitating immune evasion. Key subsets include conventional type 1 and type 2 DCs (cDC1s and cDC2s), as well as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). DC3s share certain features with cDC2s and monocytes but are distinct in their phenotype, function, and ontogeny. Functionally, DC3s can prime and activate T cells, skewing CD4+ T cells towards Th17 and stimulating CD8+ T cells with a tissue-resident memory phenotype. In cancer, their presence correlates with diverse outcomes depending on the TME: DC3 presence is linked to increased survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and oropharyngeal cancer while in non-small-cell lung cancer and melanoma it is associated with immunosuppression. The emerging understanding of DC3s highlights the complexity of DC biology and its relevance to diseases. The dynamic immunomodulatory functions of DC3s open new avenues for developing targeted therapies against cancer and immune-mediated disorders.">

We here assessed the impact of the interferon (IFN)/JAK-STAT pathway on myeloid cells from PLH and the potential of a JAK1/2 inhibitor, Baricitinib, to prevent IFN-driven myeloid cell activation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 chronically infected and virologically suppressed PLH were compared to 15 healthy uninfected individuals (UI) before and after exposure to type 1 IFN, type 2 IFN, and Baricitinib. First, we report an increased activation profile on monocytes and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) from PLH compared to UI, associated with a higher expression of PD-L1 and CD11b ex-vivo, and elevated transcription of pd-l1, cxcl-10 and ifnar1. Then, we unveil the role of type 1 and 2 IFN as inducers of PD-L1 expression at the transcriptional and protein level and highlight an increased response to IFN in PLH myeloid cells, associated with the delay before antiretroviral therapy initiation and the level of CD4 T cell depletion. Last, we describe the preventive effects of Baricitinib on IFN-driven PD-L1 expression. Our study shows that PLH harbor signs of myeloid cell activation, associated with increased type 1 and 2 IFN-signaling, which could be reversed by JAK1/2 inhibitors in vitro.

        <tr id="Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines stimulate the immune system to target cancer antigens, representing a promising option for immunotherapy. However, clinical trials have demonstrated limited effectiveness, emphasizing the need for enhanced immune responses. Improving the production of DC vaccines, assessing their impact on immune components, and observing responses could improve the results of DC-based therapies. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a heterogeneous population of innate immune components that generate cytokines and modulate the immune system, potentially enhancing immunotherapies. Recent research highlights the different functions of ILCs in cancer, demonstrating their dual capabilities to promote tumors and exhibit anti-tumor actions. DCs and ILCs actively communicate under physiological and pathological conditions, and the activation of ILCs by DCs or DC vaccines has been shown to influence ILC cytokine production and function. Gaining insights into the interaction between DC-activated ILCs and tumors is essential for creating exciting new therapeutic strategies. These strategies aim to boost anti-tumor immunity while reducing the support that tumors receive. This review examines the effect of DC vaccination on host ILCs, illustrating the complex relationship between DC-based vaccines and ILCs. Furthermore, it explores some exciting strategies to enhance DC vaccines, aiming to boost anti-tumor immune responses by fostering better engagement with ILCs.">

        <tr id="Rationale: mRNA cancer vaccines show great promise for tumor therapy, but the therapeutic efficacy is limited. Metabolites play critical roles in immunomodulation. However, their role in mRNA cancer vaccines remains poorly understood. Methods: Metabolome analysis and single-cell RNA sequence were performed to explore the most important metabolite and its source cell. B16-F10-OVA-bearing wide-type and Irg1-depleted C57BL/6 mice were treated with OVA-LNP, OVA&si-Irg1-LNP, or anti-PD-1 antibody to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Flow cytometry analysis was used to examine the immune cells within the lymph nodes, spleens, and the tumor immune environment. Results: We found that macrophage-derived itaconate was increased markedly in activated ipsilateral lymph nodes after ovalbumin-encoding mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (OVA-LNP) injection, compared to homeostatic contralateral lymph nodes. Depleting the immune-responsive gene 1(Irg1), which encodes the itaconate-production enzyme aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), in macrophages improved dendritic cell antigen presentation and enhances T cell function. Combining Irg1 knockdown via small interfering RNA (siRNA) with OVA mRNA in LNPs augmented the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA cancer vaccines, both as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a link between itaconate and mRNA cancer vaccines, suggesting that targeting Irg1 via siRNA-LNP could be a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA cancer vaccines.">

        <tr id="Background Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potential as a treatment for inflammatory diseases, including acute lung injury (ALI), due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. However, their clinical efficacy is often limited by poor post-transplant survival and adaptability in the host environment. Accordingly, MSCs are primed to boost their therapeutic efficacy for treating a variety of diseases. In our previous study, we discovered that culturing MSCs in a functional polymer-based 3D niche, which simulates the in vivo microenvironment, significantly increased integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2) expression compared to traditional 2D cultures, as revealed by RNA-seq analysis. Methods ITGA2 was used to prime MSCs and their therapeutic potential evaluated in ALI models. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were transfected with mEmerald-ITGA2 vectors and intravenously injected at 6 h post-ALI induction. Histological and biochemical analyses explored the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of ITGA2-MSCs (ITGA2 overexpressing MSCs) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI models. Results ITGA2-MSCs effectively ameliorated lung tissue injury and lowered blood IL-6 levels compared to that of the control group. Additionally, CD206 expression was highest in the ITGA2-MSC group, which was associated with the activation of M2 macrophage polarization, which contributed to inflammation reduction and tissue repair. Finally, ITGA2-MSCs demonstrated enhanced survival and adaptability when intravenously administered to mice, as indicated by the in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Conclusions ITGA2 creates a favorable microenvironment for MSCs, enhancing their immunomodulatory functions, ultimately offering a promising strategy for MSC-based cell therapy for ALI.

        <tr id="Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) selectively increases regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor analyses and show that IL-2LD clonally expands effector Treg cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Treg cells upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and show an increased number of predicted ligand–receptor interactions. These Treg cells also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By tracking the T cell receptors of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction, which is restrained by IL-2LD. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2LD. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Treg cells, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells are well recognized for their role in immune regulation; however, their role in tissue regeneration is not fully understood. This study demonstrates such a role of Tregs in a published preclinical murine model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis (PF) expressing a human PF related mutation in the Surfactant Protein-C (SP-C) gene (SFTPCI73T). Genetic crosses of SP-CI73T mice with Foxp3GFP and Foxp3DTR lines were utilized to study Treg behavior during PF development. We found that FoxP3+Tregs accumulate during the transition from inflammation to fibrogenesis, peaking at 21-28 days after mutant SftpcI73T induction localizing to both perivascular and distal fibrotic lung regions. Diphtheria toxin mediated ablation of Tregs at 17 days worsened fibrosis and increased levels of TGFβ and inflammatory cytokines. Tregs expressed Th2 markers (Gata3+) and elaborated factors including amphiregulin (Areg) and Osteopontin (Spp1). Reductionist experiments showed that lung Tregs enhanced organoid formation when co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells and adventitial fibroblasts, an effect size mimicked using Areg and Spp1 in combination. Our findings demonstrate that immune-mesenchymal-epithelial signaling crosstalk is present in the distal lung wherein Tregs play a protective role by limiting fibrosis and promoting tissue repair, highlighting their broader function beyond immune modulation in lung injury. HIGHLIGHTS In a preclinical model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were found to infiltrate the lung coincident with the resolution of early injury and transition to fibrogenesis. Depletion of Tregs at this transition worsened lung injury and enhanced fibrogenesis. Tregs recovered from the fibrotic lung are Type 2 skewed – GATA3+ and produce growth factors (e.g. Amphiregulin, Osteopontin) that promote lung tissue repair in ex vivo organoid models.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The immune system maintains homeostasis by balancing activating and inhibitory signals. CD300a is an inhibitory receptor predominantly expressed on various immune cells, including mast cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and NK cells. By recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1, CD300a attenuates immune activation by suppressing key signaling pathways like TLR-MyD88 and FcεRI-mediated signaling. Recent studies suggest that tumors may exploit this inhibitory pathway to evade anti-tumor immune responses, for example by reducing type I interferon production or impairing NK cell cytotoxicity. This review highlights the immunoregulatory functions of CD300a and discusses its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Growing evidence links immune dysfunction, notably impaired IFNγ production, to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but understanding of the immune phenotype in CPA patients remains limited. Methods To investigate this, we recruited 25 CPA patients and 25 controls with bronchiectasis, isolating immune cells from peripheral blood for detailed flow cytometric phenotyping at resting state and after ex vivo stimulation with the TLR2/Dectin-1 agonist Zymosan. Results CPA patients exhibited pronounced neutrophilia and a reduced frequency of conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets at baseline compared to bronchiectasis controls. Post-stimulation, DC and monocyte subsets in CPA patients showed significantly lower expression of activation markers. Notably, cDC1s displayed reduced IL-12p40, TNFα, and CD86 expression. CPA patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had significantly higher frequencies of activated cDC1s. Machine learning analysis validated these immunological parameters as predictive of CPA status. Conclusion Our findings suggest that immune dysfunction in CPA involves DC and monocyte impairments, potentially contributing to IFNγ deficiency through reduced IL-12 production and co-stimulatory capacity in cDC1s. These results also hint at the presence of innate immune memory in CPA patients with prior TB. Our study advances understanding of the immune dysfunction underlying CPA.">

        <tr id="Regulatory B cells (B regs) are immune cells that help suppress excessive inflammatory responses by interacting with other immune components. Among them, B-10 cells are known for their strong immunoregulatory function. This study focused on how B-10 cells influence macrophage phenotype and function through the PD-1 signaling pathway. To investigate this, B-10 cells derived from mouse spleens were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from either wild-type (WT) or PD-1 knockout (PD-1 KO) mice, using both direct contact and Transwell setups. The findings indicated that direct co-culture with B-10 cells significantly promoted the polarization of macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory M2 type, characterized by increased expression of surface markers (F4/80+, CD206+, CD163+), higher levels of PD-1, and upregulation of M2-related genes (IL-1ra, IL-10, Arg-1, IL-6, and CCL1). These macrophages also exhibited enhanced phagocytic activity and greater secretion of specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPMs) like RvD2 and 15-epi LXA4. In contrast, these effects were reduced when B-10 cells were cultured indirectly or when PD-1 was absent. These findings suggest that B-10 cells promote anti-inflammatory macrophage activity primarily through PD-1 signaling, offering insights into potential therapeutic approaches for controlling inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA) is an important therapeutic option for patients that incur debilitating injuries to the face or limbs. The complexity and immunogenicity of tissue types within VCA grafts pose unique challenges and necessitate the use of intensive immunosuppression; however, graft rejection remains a challenge in VCA. Methods Deep proteomic profiling and high dimensional analysis with cytometry time of flight were used to define the cell types and effector mechanisms elicited by VCA in BALB/c (H-2Kd) > C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) limb recipients. Spleen and cervical draining lymph nodes were collected post-transplant days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (n =4–6 mice/group/day). We identified dynamic, coordinated signatures in T cell and monocyte populations associated with VCA allograft rejection. Results In comparison to syngeneic transplant recipients, allogeneic recipients exhibited significant alterations in the immune cell populations within secondary lymphoid tissues. These changes included very early expansion of double-negative TCRβ- T cells, including IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, and patrolling monocytes. Subsequently, CD8+CD62L+ T cells and CD8+ effector/effector memory T cells (Teff/Tem), Ly6ChiCCR2hiCX3CR1low classical monocytes, CD4+ Teff/Tem, and CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem were increased by day 5. CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem with the highest expression of IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme B were enriched by day 7. Conclusions High dimensional proteomic analysis reveals multiple innate and Teff/Tem subsets in acute rejection following VCA. In particular, IL-17A-producing γδ T cells and classical monocytes may be particularly important in initiating the alloimmune response in VCA recipients.">

        <tr id="Background The treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), a leading cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer, is complicated by type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to investigate the CRLM immune microenvironment in the context of T2D and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A hyperglycemic CRLM mouse model was established. Seven single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed, including three peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) datasets (from healthy donors and T2D patients) and four datasets with 20 CRLM samples and matching PBMCs datasets, to explore the immune characteristics and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in CRLM with concurrent T2D. Results CD8+T cells exhibited dysfunction and exhaustion in liver metastasis from patients with CRLM and T2D; the proportions of various CD4+T cell subpopulations were also altered, and the number of myeloid cells and their function was increased. Myeloid cells in CRLM from patients with T2D exhibited high expression levels of CCL3, which recruited peripheral blood monocytes expressing high levels of CCR1, leading to an accumulation of myeloid cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recruited cells exhibited enhanced T cell communication abilities, indicating an augmented immunosuppressive capacity. In addition, CCR1 expression in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with CRLM was closely correlated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting that CCR1 expression levels may predict immune cell phenotype and prognosis in patients with CRLM and T2D. Conclusions Our study revealed complex changes in the tumor microenvironment of patients with CRLM and T2D. In particular, a novel mechanism was identified by which hyperglycemia regulates immunosuppression: the CCL3–CCR1 signaling axis. This finding offers a novel potential therapeutic target for patients with CRLM and T2D and provides an important theoretical basis for the future prediction of the prognosis of these patients.">

        <tr id="Background Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with over-activation, which contributes to disease progression. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates play a critical role in HIV-1 infection. However, research on the characteristics of platelet-natural killer (NK) cell aggregates in HIV-infected individuals still has certain limitations. Methods Platelet-NK cell aggregates in the peripheral blood of participants were detected by flow cytometry and confirmed by imaging flow cytometry. Platelet activation was evaluated by CD62P expression. The expression of various activating and inhibitory receptors, markers of apoptosis, lipid droplets, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Granzyme B, and Perforin in platelet-NK cell aggregates were assessed. The signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAM) family receptors in both platelets and NK cells and the levels of phosphorylation signals in NK cells were respectively measured through flow cytometry. Results In this study, we observed an increase in platelet-NK cell aggregates that were negatively correlated with CD4 count, a prognostic marker for HIV-1 disease progression. Furthermore, platelet activation was inversely associated with both HIV-1 disease progression and the platelet-NK cell aggregates. However, antiretroviral therapy (ART) couldn’t restore the levels of these aggregates or platelet activation. Compared to platelet-free NK cells, platelet-NK cell aggregates exhibited over-activation (CD69) and exhaustion phenotypes (CD39, LAG-3, PD-1), increased levels of apoptosis (Annexin V and CD95) and lipid droplets (Bodipy 493/503 and LipidTOX). Furthermore, NK cells' cytokine secretion (IFN-γ) and cytotoxic function (Granzyme B and Perforin) within the aggregates were declined. Screening results of SLAM receptors in NK cells and platelets suggested that platelets may transmit signals to NK cells via SLAMF5. Moreover, elevated levels of p-Fyn, p-PLC-γ2, p-SHP-1, and p-SHP-2 denoted disturbances in the downstream signals of the SLAM family within platelet-NK cell aggregates. Conclusion Our study indicates that platelet-NK cell aggregates exhibit characteristics of over-activation and dysfunction during HIV-1 infection. Hyperactivated platelets and the formation of platelet-NK cell aggregates contribute to the HIV-1 disease progression and the inflammation of the immune system. These findings may implicate potential targets of overactivated platelets for HIV-1 disease progression.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet its clinical efficacy remains limited to a subset of patients with specific tumor types. The present review provides a comprehensive analysis of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity from both local and systemic perspectives, with particular emphasis on CD8+ T cells as primary effectors. The review discusses how the complex trafficking between the tumor microenvironment (TME), surrounding lymphoid tissues and peripheral circulation creates multiple opportunities for tumors to evade immune surveillance. Within the TME, T-cell exclusion mechanisms, antigen specificity and the spectrum of T-cell exhaustion states, from progenitor exhausted T cells to terminally exhausted T-cell phenotypes, are reviewed. Beyond the local TME, the crucial roles of tumor-draining lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in maintaining sustainable antitumor immunity, as well as the significance of circulating T cells as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are analyzed. This systemic perspective provides insights into the dynamic nature of antitumor immunity and suggests potential strategies for next-generation immunotherapies, including combination approaches targeting multiple immune compartments to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.">

This review summarizes recent studies in understanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) biology, highlighting CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as pivotal regulators of immune surveillance and suppression. We summarize emerging biomarkers such as TCR clonality, spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and exhaustion markers including PD-1, TCF1, and TIM-3, which predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy beyond PD-L1 expression. This review specifically describes radiotherapy-induced immunogenic remodeling and peripheral T cell dynamics as innovative strategies to monitor immune response and resistance mechanisms. By integrating results from single-cell omics and AI-driven spatial analysis, we propose multidimensional frameworks of TIL in NSCLC to overcome resistance and optimize immunotherapy combinations.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells have evolved to detect abnormalities in tissues arising from infection with pathogens, genomic damage, or transformation and respond rapidly to the production of potent proinflammatory and cytolytic mediators. While this acute proinflammatory response is highly efficient at orchestrating sterilizing immunity to pathogens in a matter of days, cellular transformation often avoids the innate detection mechanisms of NK cells. When cellular transformation results in malignancy, tumor cells and/or the tumor microenvironment can evolve additional mechanisms to circumvent NK cell responses, and cancer is now a dominant disease burden worldwide. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the combined relationship between malignancies and natural killer (NK) cells, learn from recent clinical efforts in therapeutically targeting natural killer (NK) cells in cancer and outline some emerging therapeutic concepts that aim to improve the innate immune response against cancer.">

        <tr id="Aging leads to a gradual decline in immune function, termed immunosenescence, which significantly elevates the susceptibility to infections, cancers, and other aging-related diseases. Recent advancements have shed light on the molecular underpinnings of immune aging and pioneered novel therapeutic interventions to counteract its effects. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-a type of multipotent stromal cells with regenerative potential, low immunogenicity, and strong immunomodulatory properties-are increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic option to reverse or alleviate immunosenescence-related dysfunction. This review systematically summarizes recent discoveries on how MSCs counteract immune aging, particularly their ability to rejuvenate aged immune cells and restore immune homeostasis. It also addresses key challenges, such as variations in MSC sources, donor variability, and the lack of standardized protocols, while proposing future directions to enhance therapeutic precision. Although preclinical and clinical studies highlight the potential of MSC-based strategies for delaying immunosenescence, critical issues remain unresolved, including long-term safety and efficacy, optimizing cell delivery systems, and elucidating context-specific mechanisms. Addressing these challenges will accelerate the development of MSC-based therapies to combat aging-associated immune decline.">

        <tr id="Objective: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Chemotherapy is associated with side effects, such as damage to myeloid cells and a reduction in the number of immune cells in patients. In addition, tumor cells hijack the mitochondria of immune cells through tunnel nanotubes, thereby weakening immune ability. Methods: In this study the effects of direct mitochondria transplantation on cancer cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic sensitivity were determined, as well as anti-tumor immunity in in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. Results: A combination of mitochondrial transplantation and cisplatin chemotherapy was shown for the first time to significantly improve immune infiltration of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and overcome the shortcomings of cisplatin chemotherapy, including damage to myeloid cells and a reduction in the number of immune cells. Conclusions: The findings of the current study provide valuable recommendations for enhancing immune infiltration and augmenting anti-tumor efficacy during chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. In addition, the findings support “mitochondrial transfer” as a novel paradigm in tumor treatment.">

        <tr id="Innate immune memory, also called trained immunity, is a metabolic and epigenetically regulated process that enables innate immune cells to recalibrate their inflammatory reactivity in response to pathogenic or endogenous stimuli. In addition to its function in host defense, trained immunity contributes to diverse immune-mediated diseases. We discovered that complement component 1q (C1q) is an effective modulator of innate immune memory, potently suppressing the responsiveness of myeloid cells. We found that C1q leads to profound reprogramming of myeloid cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis, and exerts control over the transcriptional regulation of important metabolic and inflammatory genes. We corroborate our findings by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms close to the C1q gene that are linked to induction of trained immunity by Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) or beta-glucan in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results reveal an immunomodulatory role for C1q and provide evidence of a molecular interaction between the complement system and innate immune memory.

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite causative links to lymphoproliferative disorders, little is known about early events governing KSHV infection in B lymphocytes. IL‐6 signaling plays a critical role in KSHV‐mediated disease, with human IL‐6 (hIL6) levels correlating with viral load and disease progression. This dynamic is even more complex due to the coexistence of hIL6 and KSHV‐encoded viral IL‐6 (vIL6) in these diseases. We hypothesize that hIL6 and vIL6 play critical, separable and collective roles in the early stages of KSHV infection in B cells. In this study, we use our ex vivo model of KSHV infection in human tonsil lymphocytes to investigate the relative contributions of vIL6 and hIL6 to early infection events in human B cells. We demonstrate that vIL6 and hIL6 collectively suppress KSHV infection in B cells restricting the distribution of KSHV within B cell subsets. We show that vIL6 manipulates hIL6 expression in a subset‐specific manner, and that vIL6 and hIL6 differentially influence the differentiation of germinal center and plasmablasts. Taken together, these results suggest a novel paradigm in which KSHV uses vIL6 to abrogate the GC‐mediated maturation pathway for antibody secreting cells that is driven by hIL6 signaling.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following lung cancer. Despite the immune system’s capacity for tumor surveillance and elimination, CRC tumors can evade immune responses through complex mechanisms, ultimately escaping immune detection. T and B lymphocytes play a critical role in adaptive immunity against tumors, with T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, driving tumor elimination. Additionally, B cells contribute by producing tumor-specific antibodies, including various immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses that participate in immune modulation. However, the effectiveness of adaptive immunity in CRC is often limited due to tumor-driven immunosuppression. This study investigates the expression of T and B cell activation genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CRC patients. A panel of 84 genes involved in T and B cell activation was analyzed to assess changes in expression using RT2 QPCR arrays. Additionally, we measured serum levels of the four IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) in CRC patients to explore possible alterations in humoral immunity. Compared to healthy controls, 5 genes were found to be downregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCL3 (fold regulation − 6.36), IL6 (fold regulation − 12.46), CSF2 (fold regulation − 7.50), CXCR3 (fold regulation − 3.01), and TNFSF14 (fold regulation − 4.90). Moreover, 13 genes were upregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCR3 (fold regulation 59.21), CD2 (fold regulation 3.07), CD27 (fold regulation 6.39), CD3G (fold regulation 4.15), CD8B (fold regulation 3.25), FAS (fold regulation 3.94), IL10 (fold regulation 39), IL18R1 (fold regulation 82.39), IL5 (fold regulation 20.4), LAG3 (fold regulation 19.88), MAP3K7 (fold regulation 4.07), TLR1 (fold regulation 6.45), and TLR6 (fold regulation 18.87). The serum levels of the four IgG subclasses were however statistically insignificant in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive immune dysfunction in CRC, offering a detailed profile of gene expression changes associated with T and B cell activation and antibody production. Understanding these dysregulations may enhance the development of targeted immunotherapies, potentially improving outcomes for CRC patients through more personalized immunomodulatory approaches.

        <tr id="Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that enables EOC progression and limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. In this study, we demonstrated that isogenic BRCA2-mutated PEO1 and BRCA2-wild type PEO4 EOC cells induced immunosuppressive TMEs through distinct mechanisms. PEO1 cells produced IFNγ-induced PD-L1 and expressed CD39 and CD73 for generating adenosine. Treatment with the adenosine antagonist CGS15943 reversed PEO1 cell-mediated suppression of effector T cell activation. In contrast, PEO4 cells secreted IFNγ-induced CXCL10 and promoted up-regulation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Treatment with the CXCL10/CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 attenuated PEO4 cell-induced Tregs and decreased IL10 production. In vivo, administration of a monoclonal antibody against CXCR3 effectively hindered the progression of tumor ascites and prolonged survival in the p53(-/-) ID8 EOC syngeneic mouse model. Additionally, AMG487 treatment synergized with the VEGFA inhibitor bevacizumab, significantly reducing tumor ascites and extending mouse survival. Collectively, our results reveal that EOC leverages CXCL10-induced Tregs or adenosine signaling to dampen T cell-mediated anti-cancer immune responses. These findings suggest that targeting CXCL10/CXCR3 and adenosine signaling could effectively counter immunosuppression of EOC, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for improving patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Introduction Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently characterized subset of lymphocytes with critical effector and regulatory functions. Based on distinct phenotypic markers and cytokine secretion profiles, ILCs are classified into three subtypes: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) is characterized by heightened cytokine levels and dysregulated inflammatory responses, potentially affecting immune cell composition. In this study, we aimed to assess the frequency and absolute number of ILCs in the BM and peripheral blood (PB) of healthy individuals (HI) and compare them to those in MDS-BM. Methods ILC subsets were identified and quantified using multiparameter flow cytometry and histological analysis of BM and PB samples. Results ILC1 populations were consistently detected in all PB and BM samples. In contrast, ILC2 and ILC3 subsets were present in both BM and PB of healthy individuals but were largely absent in MDS-BM samples. Additionally, our findings suggest the existence of a potential maturation trajectory for BM-resident ILCs. Discussion These data indicate a disruption in the ILC maturation continuum within the MDS-affected BM compared to healthy BM, potentially contributing to the immunopathogenesis of MDS.">

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ−) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ− cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer’s Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that plays a critical role in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, exhibit dual functions, either promoting or suppressing tumor growth depending on their phenotype and interactions within the TME. The presence of immune evasion mechanisms, such as the loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, and metabolic reprogramming (hypoxia-induced glycolysis and lactate accumulation), further contributes to immune suppression and poor treatment responses. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response rates remain highly variable, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and combinatorial therapeutic strategies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of immune cells in the TME of HNSCC, discusses the mechanisms underlying immune escape, and explores emerging immunotherapeutic and epigenetic-targeting approaches aimed at enhancing antitumor immune responses and improving clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="This study investigates the interplay between cellular senescence and inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We employed RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression changes in HUVECs subjected to replicative- or radiation-stress-induced senescence, and we compared these profiles with those of cells under acute or chronic TNFα-mediated inflammation. Our findings reveal that both senescence types exhibited significant upregulation of genes associated with epithelial- (or endothelial) mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory pathways, indicating a shared molecular response. Notably, chronic inflammation led to a pronounced EMT signature, while acute inflammation primarily activated classical inflammatory responses. Experimental validation confirmed reduced proliferation and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in senescent and chronically inflamed cells and substantiated the upregulation of EMT marker genes. Additionally, we observed impaired wound healing capacity in senescent and chronically inflamed cells, highlighting the functional consequences of these cellular states. Our study underscores the critical role of inflammation in exacerbating senescence-related changes, contributing to the understanding of age-related cardiovascular pathologies. These insights may inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of aging and inflammation on endothelial function and cardiovascular health.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) is commonly labeled a “cold tumor” due to its dense population of immunosuppressive cells, particularly M2-like macrophages, which contribute to its resistance to therapy. Thus, there is a pressing need to shift the macrophage polarization towards M1 and revitalize the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to improve BC prognosis. In this study, we leveraged published RNA-sequencing data and performed multiplex immunohistochemistry on clinical specimens to identify NR4A3 as a promising biomarker for favorable outcomes in BC. High NR4A3 expression correlates with an inflamed TIME, characterized by heightened T-cell infiltration and activation. NR4A3 was preferentially expressed in macrophages and fostered M1-like macrophage polarization through direct binding to p65, thereby enhancing NF-κB transcriptional activity. Overexpression of Nr4a3 in tumor-infiltrating macrophages significantly inhibited the growth of E0771 tumors in a syngeneic mouse model, accompanied by increased T-cell infiltration and elevated production of functional cytokines. Conversely, suppression of Nr4a3 in macrophages compromised T-cell recruitment and diminished their anti-tumor capabilities. Consistent with these findings, co-culture experiments involving human T cells and NR4A3-overexpressing THP1 cells further demonstrated enhanced T-cell functionality. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel role for NR4A3 in macrophage polarization and TIME remodeling, offering a potential biomarker for favorable BC prognosis and a therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.">

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

        <tr id="Lung metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer mortality, driven not only by primary tumors but crucially by dynamic interactions within the premetastatic niche (PMN). Emerging evidence reveals that organ‐specific PMN formation precedes tumor cell arrival, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to metastatic colonization. Primary tumor‐derived factors interact with lung resident cells, promoting the recruitment of bone marrow‐derived cells and creating a favorable microenvironment for the migrating tumor cells. Despite progress, systematic integration of PMN's multilayered regulatory mechanisms—from mechanism to clinical application remains lacking. The review summarizes recent studies investigating the effects of PMN in the entire process of lung metastasis. Our discussion revolves primarily around extracellular vesicles, extracellular matrix remodeling, proinflammation, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming. We emphasize the impact of various treatment strategies for primary tumors on the PMN in clinical practice, while also summarizing current diagnostic methods and exploring new therapeutic possibilities in the PMN. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future investigations into the lung PMN, highlighting prioritized research axes that bridge mechanistic discoveries with bench‐to‐bedside translation of PMN‐targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated bone marrow failure (BMF) entails a complex immune landscape. Myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are involved in the development and progression of immune aplastic anemia (AA). We used a murine model of BMF to explore the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on immune pathophysiology. Hematopoiesis, immune cell populations, and gene expression were assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing. CSF-1R inhibition with the small molecule PLX3397 intensified BMF in CByB6F1 mice, enhancing inflammation and macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This was accompanied by increased leukocyte apoptosis, a reduction in CD11b+ myeloid cells, and worsened animal survival. In contrast, the JAK-inhibitor baricitinib attenuated BMF, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed upregulation of M1 signature genes in both murine BMF and also AA human samples. In patients with severe AA, there was a shift towards an M1-like monocyte phenotype, correlating with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and altered MDSC populations. These findings highlight the role of myeloid-derived cells in BMF and suggest that M1 macrophages, with defective MDSC function, contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. Targeting macrophage polarization or MDSCs offers alternative therapeutic strategies in immune-mediated BMF.">

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have recently emerged as key regulators of mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis and are increasingly implicated in IBD. Unlike adaptive lymphocytes, ILCs do not require antigen recognition and clonal expansion to respond rapidly to environmental cues and shape immune responses. In a healthy gut, ILCs maintain intestinal homeostasis by guarding the epithelial barrier, protecting against pathogens, and mounting proper responses to external insults. However, their altered differentiation, proliferation, recruitment, activation, and interaction with other host cells, microbiota, and environmental stimuli may contribute to IBD. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding murine and human ILCs in the context of intestinal inflammation and IBD. A deeper understanding of ILC-mediated immune mechanisms may offer novel therapeutic strategies for restoring intestinal homeostasis and improving personalized management of IBD.">

        <tr id="Introduction Microvascular injury is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis, but its interaction with the immune system in early infection is unclear. This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

        <tr id="Background Aging is linked to various dysfunctions of the immune system, including the decline of its primary developmental source: the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). Results An analysis of the conditioned media from young and aged HSC niches revealed that the environment of aged niches exhibited an increased presence of adiponectin. This media was subsequently utilized in BMDC differentiation and maturation protocols, with their effects closely monitored. Our results indicate that the old HSC niche microenvironment promotes premature BMDC activation, characterized by elevated MHC class II expression and enhanced allostimulatory capacity of BMDCs at their immature stage. Additionally, LPS stimulation of BMDCs, used to induce DC maturation, significantly increased CD86 expression on BMDCs from the aged niche. However, these cells did not show superior allostimulatory capacity compared to their counterparts from the young niche environment. By analyzing the BMDC cytokine profile, we observed that when cultured in aged niche-conditioned media, the BMDCs secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, indicating a heightened proinflammatory activation state. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that aging-related changes within the HSC niche can considerably alter DC functionality by disrupting their normal development from BM precursors. These results emphasize the significance of this phenomenon and its implications for immunosenescence.

 Background:
 Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that engage in direct cytotoxic responses against malignant cells and promote pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironments. While studies have predominantly focused on conventional NK cell subsets, recent findings uncovered adaptive and tissue-resident (TR) subsets with unique functional properties. The influence of distinct NK cell subsets on tumor immunobiology and clinical outcomes remains unknown.
 Methods:
 Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary, therapy-naïve tumors from 276 patients across 14 cancer types, as well as 39 patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), was accessed through publicly available datasets. We employed systematic computational analyses to phenotype and examine intra-tumoral NK cells. Gene signatures for NK cell subsets were applied to bulk RNA-sequencing from 212,105 tumor samples to delineate their associations with clinical outcomes using the Caris CODEai database.
 Results:
 Six main subsets of NK cells were identified in solid tumors, including conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 NK cells, alongside adaptive, TR adaptive, TR CD56
 bright
 , and TR CD56
 bright
 /adaptive subsets. Across cancer, TR adaptive NK cells emerged as the most prognostic subset, with high infiltration conferring significantly longer overall survival (HR[95% CI] = 0.68[0.66-0.69], p < 0.001) than conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 subsets. This was also observed in cohorts of head and neck, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancers, particularly those treated with ICB. Notably, elevated TR adaptive NK cell infiltration was more prognostic than high tumor mutational burden in these settings. This was most apparent in ICB-treated head and neck cancers (HR = 0.48[0.41-0.57], p < 0.001 vs HR = 0.90[0.76-1.04], p = 0.16). Additionally, TR adaptive NK cells were strongly correlated to the infiltration of CD8
 +
 T cells and B cells in tumors. Underlying these observations, our scRNA-seq analyses demonstrated that TR adaptive NK cells exhibit the highest immunomodulatory activity of all subsets, expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 CCL3
 ,
 CXCL13
 , and
 IFNG
 ) and low levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (
 TGFB1
 ). Mechanistically, this activity was linked to the upregulation of transcription factors associated with NK cell activation, function, and persistence and downregulation of genes related to stress response and exhaustion. Interestingly, scRNA-seq from paired pre- and post-ICB-treated tumors revealed a unique expansion of cytotoxic
 GZMB
 + TR adaptive NK cells after treatment.
 Conclusions:
 TR adaptive NK cells represent a novel subset of NK cells that may drive anti-tumor immune responses, particularly in the context of ICB treatment. Features of this unique population may be harnessed to design more effective NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors.

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the first line of defense in nonspecific immunity (innate immunity) and interact with other immune cells to participate in specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity). Studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediates tumor development and recruits neutrophils into tumors to become tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), an important part of TME, and achieve extended lifespan. TANs can be differentiated into the antitumor or protumor phenotype, and play an important role in tumor occurrence, proliferation and recurrence, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, cell necrosis, and so on. Here, we summarize the TAN origin and subtypes found through Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in different types of tumors in recent literature, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their antitumor and protumor effects on tumors. We focus on the interaction between TANs and immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory TME, as well as signal pathways such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) associated with TAN phenotype transition. Based on the summarized mechanisms, we focus on the potential application and latest strategies of TAN-based immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and combination therapy in the preclinical study and clinical trials of tumors. The discussion on promising therapy encompasses five key areas: inhibition of the tumor-promoting effect of TANs, enhancement of the antitumor effect of TANs, targeting the interaction between TANs and the TME, reprogramming of TANs, and drug delivery carriers. Finally, we discuss the potential of TANs and their related markers as emerging biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients.">

To better understand its pathophysiology, we apply advanced single cell methodologies, including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA, and TCR/BCR sequencing, to patient samples from a clinical trial of immunosuppression and growth factor stimulation. We observe opposing changes in the abundance of myeloid cells and T cells, with T cell clonal expansion dominated by effector memory cells. Therapy reduces and suppresses cytotoxic T cells, but new T cell clones emerge hindering robust hematopoietic recovery. Enhanced cell-cell interactions including between hematopoietic cells and immune cells, in particular evolving IFNG and IFNGR, are noted in patients and are suppressed post-therapy. Hematologic recovery occurs with increases in the progenitor rather than stem cells.

        <tr id="The therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in lung cancer remains constrained and demonstrates substantial variability across different patients. Targeting the metabolism of tumors emerges an encouraging strategy to enhance the outcomes of tumor immunotherapy. We analyzed metabolic differences in lung cancer post-anti-PD-1 treatment using a single-cell RNA sequencing data (n = 15). Abnormal lipid metabolism is notable in patients with a non-major pathological response, and low RAN expression is linked to good immunotherapy response. RAN showed increased expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) versus normal lung tissues, correlating with worse prognosis, advanced staging, reduced immune cell activity, and greater sensitivity to common chemotherapeutic drugs. Knockdown of RAN caused G2/M phase arrest, inhibiting proliferation and clone formation in LUAD cells. RAN modifies lipid metabolism via nuclear p-AMPK output to aid tumor cells in resisting immunotherapy and reduces MHC-related molecule expression to evade CD8 + T cell detection. Combining Selinexor with immunotherapy might effectively counter immune tolerance and boost anti-tumor responses in LUAD.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Most exhaustion studies have focused on CD8+ T cells. Here, we demonstrated reciprocal growth inhibition of CD4+ T cells and colorectal cancer cells, which induced the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in CD4+ T cells. The accelerated exhaustion of CD4+ T cells was evidenced by the reduced secretion of several cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-γ, or TNFα, and elevated secretion of CXCL family chemokines. Progressive expression of PD-L1, CTLA4, and IDO1 exhaustion markers occurred concomitantly with tumor growth in vivo in a mouse model. The pattern of CD4+ T cell exhaustion was analogous to that observed in CD8+ T cells, although with altered dynamics. The PD-L1-high phenotype can be induced by co-culture with tumor cells and is mediated by secreted factors in addition to cell contact. Our findings revealed that IFN-γ receptor knockout T cells exhibited PD-L1 protein expression when cultured with tumor cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is not fully dependent on IFN-γ. The TIL population undergoing exhaustion due to persistent antigen stimulation in the presence of cancer cells gradually acquires an immunosuppressive phenotype. The accumulation of inhibitory signals exerted by both cancer cells and T cells, which had converted to a suppressive phenotype, accelerated T cell exhaustion.">

The leukemia arises, most commonly after a latency of 3–5 years, from a preleukemic B cell precursor population generated in utero. Despite the generally low immunogenicity of B-ALL cells, emerging evidence implicates T cell exhaustion - a state marked by sustained expression of inhibitory receptors and progressive functional decline - as a contributor to disease progression. Expression of inhibitory receptors is frequently detected on T cells from children with B-ALL at diagnosis and during therapy. As T cell exhaustion presents an actionable target for enhancing protective immune activity, in this review we summarize evidence from both clinical and pre-clinical settings for T cell exhaustion during pediatric B-ALL progression and discuss the opportunities and challenges to incorporating immune checkpoint blockade into pediatric B-ALL therapy regimens.">

To overcome these limitations, emerging CAR platforms that utilize alternative immune effectors, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and γδ T lymphocytes, are rapidly gaining traction. This review systematically analyzes the mechanistic advantages of CAR-NK, CAR-M, and CAR-γδ T cell therapies, while critically evaluating persistent challenges in clinical translation, including limited cell persistence, manufacturing scalability, and dynamic immune evasion mechanisms.

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) possess immunoregulatory capacity, which is enhanced in an inflammatory environment. Participation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in this function is proposed, as they can transport various immunoregulatory molecules. However, the impact of the inflammatory microenvironment on the load of the different types of EVs released by these cells is not fully known. Therefore, this work analyzes in detail the temporal effect of IFN-γ, alone or in combination with TNF-α (TNF-α + IFN-γ), on the cargo of immunoregulatory molecules (programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1], CD73, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1]) in large extracellular vesicles (L-EVs) released by human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). The presence of these molecules on the surface of L-EVs was determined by flow cytometry. Our results demonstrate that exposing BM-MSCs to TNF-α + IFN-γ for 24 h increases the percentage of PD-L1+ and CD73+ L-EVs. However, if this stimulus persists, the release of L-EVs with an immunoregulatory phenotype (PD-L1+, CD73+, and PD-L1+CD73+) decreases. The impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the transport of ICAM-1 by L-EVs is late, since up to 72 h of treatment with IFN-γ or TNF-α + IFN-γ, the percentage of ICAM-1+ L-EVs increases. In contrast, stimulation with IFN-γ for 72 h favors the release of CD73high and ICAM-1high L-EVs, but this effect also decreases in the presence of TNF-α. Our study generates novel knowledge about the impact of the inflammatory microenvironment on the cargo composition of L-EVs released by BM-MSCs and demonstrates, for the first time, that the prolonged presence of TNF-α reduces the cargo of immunoregulatory molecules in these structures.">

Myeloid cells, which includes neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, microglia, and macrophages, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), T cells and natural killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor functions, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can promote tumor progression by suppressing these immune responses. Therefore, MDSCs play a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of immunotherapy. TME has constrained the ability of traditional GBM treatment approaches to significantly enhance prognostic outcomes for patients. This category encompasses conventional therapies like surgical resection and radiation therapy, along with cutting-edge methodologies such as immunotherapy. Through extensive investigations into the dynamic interactions between the GBM microenvironment and neoplastic cells, both targeted treatment strategies and innovative immunotherapeutic modalities have emerged, offering promising new directions for clinical intervention.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a high-mortality cancer due to its aggressive nature and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which enables evasion of immune surveillance. Despite chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival is ~ 30%, necessitating novel immunotherapies. AML suppresses cytotoxic T/NK cells by co-opting regulatory pathways, creating an “immune paradox.” Emerging strategies aim to disrupt this evasion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CD47 magrolimab, combined with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), enhance T-cell activity and phagocytosis, especially in TP53-mutated AML. Therapeutic vaccines targeting leukemia-associated antigens (e.g., WT1, PRAME) via dendritic cell fusion show early success in prolonging remission. Combinatorial approaches, like HMAs with STING agonists or dual checkpoint blockade, target multiple immunosuppressive pathways to overcome resistance. Challenges include TME heterogeneity, therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells, toxicities (e.g., anemia, cytokine release syndrome), relapse from clonal evolution, and a lack of predictive biomarkers. Autologous therapies face economic and logistical hurdles, driving demand for scalable solutions. Advances in single-cell genomics, AI, and synthetic biology are identifying novel targets (TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA) and improving patient stratification. Integrating these innovations may transform AML into a chronic condition, bridging preclinical potential to clinical impact. In this review, we aim to evaluate mechanisms, challenges, and future directions of immunotherapies in AML with highlighting ICIs and vaccination to improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Management of difficult-to-heal skin wounds presents a significant clinical challenge, particularly when associated with inflammatory skin disorders. The differentiation of stem cells into keratinocyte-like cells has been explored as a potential regenerative therapy. Ras-related protein (Rab) 7, a key regulator of membrane trafficking, influences the activity of several growth factors. In this study, the competitive Rab7 inhibitor, CID-1067700, was investigated for the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cell into keratinocyte-like cells. This treatment upregulated several epidermal markers, including P63, cytokeratin 5 and 14 and filaggrin, while downregulated the stem cell marker, vimentin. Microarray data showed upregulation of the anti-inflammatory gene HMOX-1, coupled with the downregulation of various inflammation-related pathways, such as TNF, chemokine, AGE-RAGE and IL-17 signalling cascades, as well as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Gene set enrichment analysis predicted Ehmt2, an epigenetic regulator, to be the top activated upstream regulator, enhancing the transcriptional activity. Protein array analysis showed reduced secretion of several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-8, IL-17A, and IL-32, while enhancing the secretion of the epidermal growth factor. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that CID-1067700, as an additive to the differentiation media, not only enhances stem cell differentiation into keratinocyte-like cells, but also improves their anti-inflammatory properties. These combined regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties may offer significant therapeutic potential for patients with chronic skin wounds, particularly those with underlying inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression heavily relies on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In the ccRCC TME, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive a self-perpetuating cycle of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance through diverse interactions between cells and molecules. Furthermore, heterogeneous CAFs facilitate tumor growth through metabolic reprogramming and modulate immune suppression by driving the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which promote a multilayered immunosuppressive network. In addition, CAFs reshape the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), hinder the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and further exacerbate immune escape. Moreover, CAF-derived exosomes can confer resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by CAFs synergizes with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate adaptive resistance to targeted therapy. Emerging therapeutic strategies—including fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted CAR-T cells and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitors—can partially reverse this immunosuppressive property. Combination therapies employing immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF antagonists exhibit promising synergistic effects, although the clinical translation remains hampered by CAF heterogeneity, dual functional roles, and the lack of specific biomarkers. Future studies should integrate single-cell sequencing and spatial multi-omics techniques to comprehensively analyze the spatio-temporal dynamic heterogeneity of CAF subpopulations and develop precision treatment strategies based on molecular subtyping, aiming to break the vicious cycle of “CAF-TME-resistance” in ccRCC.">

        <tr id="The liver presents a unique immune system. Liver diseases are closely associated with the immune system. Disruption of the tightly regulated balance between immune activation and tolerance induction leads to the development and worsening of immune-related liver diseases. T cells play diverse crucial roles in the immune system, and they have long been known to induce inflammation through direct tissue damage by effector molecules and the recruitment of effector cells via chemokines. Additionally, T cells interact with B cells to induce autoantibodies, promoting tissue inflammation and dysfunction through the deposition of IgG and immune complexes in the tissues. Recent advances in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have elucidated the role of T cells in the progression and recovery of liver fibrosis. Moreover, comprehensive and unbiased information can now be obtained from small samples of human and mouse tissues, which advances our understanding of tissue-specific functions of T cells, including resident memory T cells, peripheral helper T cells, and tissue Tregs. However, significant unmet needs remain in the fields of immune-related liver diseases. In this review, we discuss the T cell biology and its role in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which are non-viral liver diseases exhibiting a strong involvement of immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, the latest therapeutic concepts for the diseases and associated drugs targeting T cells have been overviewed.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has shown limited efficacy in colorectal cancer (CRC), necessitating the urgent identification of novel immunotherapeutic targets to address this challenge. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are complex immune structures that spontaneously form within and outside of the tumor microenvironment, resembling secondary lymphoid organs. The formation of TLS formation dynamically adapts to the tumor microenvironment, with their immune function maintained by resident immune cells and cytokine networks. TLS develops antitumor immune competence following dynamic reorganization of their cellular components and proportions, although the precise mechanistic underpinnings remain to be fully characterized. Numerous studies have demonstrated that TLS can modulate the immune status of CRC, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Currently, the clinical setting lacks appropriate immunological markers to assess immunotherapy outcomes, and TLS may offer a solution to this limitation. This article will review current research on TLS as a novel therapeutic target in the immunotherapy of malignant colorectal tumors.">

Despite standard-of-care consisting of surgical resection, when possible, adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ), GB remains highly fatal, with an estimated recurrence rate of over 90% and a median overall survival (OS) of around 15 months from diagnosis. Several factors contribute to such poor patient outcome, including a unique myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment (TME) that confers immunosuppression and therapeutic resistance.

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="CKLF (chemokine-like factor)-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family member 4 (CMTM4), belonging to the CMTM family of transmembrane domain proteins, plays a significant role in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Nevertheless, its involvement in tumor immunity remains elusive. In the present investigation, we observed an upregulation of CMTM4 expression in patients with cervical cancer (CC), which also serves as a prognostic indicator for patients with CC. In vitro experiments and therapeutic models have demonstrated that CMTM4 upregulates the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment via the CCL2 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 2)/CCR2 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 2) and IL-6 (interleukin-6)/GP130 (glycoprotein 130) axes. This process exerts immunosuppressive effects and promotes the occurrence and progression of CC. Mechanistically, CMTM4 interacts and stabilizes PHB2 (prohibitin 2) through post-translational modification, which further induces activation of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes)/TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1)/STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) pathway, facilitating the nuclear translocation of STAT6 which binds to the CCL2/IL-6 promoter, leading to the upregulation of CCL2/IL-6 transcription expression. Importantly, targeting CMTM4 with CMTM4-small interfering RNA enhanced the effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Our study identifies CMTM4 as a crucial determinant guiding the homing of MDSCs to CC, thereby contributing to MDSCs-mediated immune suppression and tumor progression. The combination of CMTM4 inhibition and anti-PD-1 treatment shows promising antitumor efficacy against CC. These findings offer novel insights into the tumor microenvironment and have the potential to inform the development of innovative immunotherapy approaches for CC.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident macrophages (TRM) are critical for mammalian organismal development and homeostasis. Here we report that with-no-lysine 1 (WNK1) controls myeloid progenitor fate, with Csf1riCre-mediated Wnk1 deletion in mice (WNK1-deficient mice) resulting in loss of TRMs and causing perinatal mortality. Mechanistically, absence of WNK1 or inhibition of WNK kinase activity disrupts macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-stimulated macropinocytosis, thereby blocking mouse and human progenitor and monocyte differentiation into macrophages and skewing progenitor differentiation into neutrophils. Treatment with PMA rescues macropinocytosis but not macrophage differentiation of WNK-inhibited progenitors, implicating that M-CSF-stimulated, macropinocytosis-induced activation of WNK1 is required for macrophage differentiation. Finally, M-CSF-stimulated macropinocytosis triggers WNK1 nuclear translocation and concomitant increased protein expression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)8, whereas inhibition of macropinocytosis or WNK kinase activity suppresses IRF8 expression. Our results thus suggest that WNK1 and downstream IRF8-regulated genes are important for M-CSF/macropinocytosis-mediated regulation of myeloid cell lineage commitment during TRM development and homeostasis.">

One group of immune gene-producing cells that have been identified is type 2 innate lymphoid cells (Ilc2). These cells are involved in the production of Th2 equivalent immune responses and signal cytokine production during the resolution of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis parasite infection in mice lungs. However, many questions about Ilc2 activity in the gut remain. To study this, retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα)-deficient mice were infected with adult N. brasiliensis and arranged into four treatment groups. Ten days post-infection (dpi), mouse ileum tissue was extracted for RNA-Seq. The RORα-deficient mice showed little change in gene expression at 10 dpi (N = 51) when compared to the WT mice at 10 dpi (N = 915), displaying dysregulation within the mouse gut. Based on the results, the gene expression in the gut of Ilc2-deficient mice denoted that the inability to craft Ilc2 cells left the mice unable to mount classical helminth immune responses involving humoral, mast cell, and antibody Th2-driven reactions. Overall, the results showed the importance of Ilc2 in the gut during N. brasiliensis infections and the effect that the lack of these cells had on immunity.">

This study aims to construct a novel risk model for AML patient through comprehensive analysis of scRNA and bulk RNA data to optimize the precise treatment strategies for patients and improve prognosis. Methods and Results scRNA-seq classified cells into nine clusters, including Bcells, erythrocyte, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC/Prog), monocyte/macrophagocyte (Mono/Macro), myelocyte, neutrophils, plasma, and T/NK cells. Functional analysis demonstrated the important role of inflammation immune response in the pathogenesis of AML, and the leukocyte transendothelial migration and adhesion in the process of inflammation should be noticed. ssGSEA method identified four core cells including GMP, HSC/Prog, Mono/Macro, and myelocyte for subsequent analysis, which contains 1,594 marker genes. Furthermore, we identified AML-associated genes (2,067genes) and DEGs (1,010genes) between AML patients and controls usingGSE114868dataset. After performing intersection, univariate Cox, and LASSO analysis, we obtained a prognostic model based on the expression levels of five signature genes, namely, CALR, KDM1A, SUCNR1, TMEM220, and ADM. The prognostic model was then validated by two external datasets. Patients with high-risk scores are predisposed to experience poor overall survival. Further GSEA analysis of risk-model-related genes revealed the significant differences in inflammatory response between high-and low-risk groups. Conclusion In conclusion, we constructed an inflammation related risk model using internal scRNA data and external bulk RNA data, which can accurately distinguish survival outcomes in AML patients.">

Within the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cells exhibit dual regulatory roles-exerting critical regulatory influences on both tumorigenesis and disease progression while simultaneously serving as therapeutic targets. Particularly in OS, the dynamic interplay between malignant cells and the unique bone microenvironment manifests through intricate immune cell-mediated crosstalk. This comprehensive review analyzes the paradoxical roles of immune cell subsets in OS pathophysiology, detailing their tumor-promoting versus tumor-suppressing functions.

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has shown limited efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-15 has been identified as a novel immune evasion biomarker, while the role of Siglec-10 in the specific immune suppressive tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Methods Immunohistochemical assays were employed to investigate the correlation of the expressions of Siglec-10 and Siglec-15 with the clinicopathological features as well as the prognosis of immunotherapy in patients with HNSCC. The Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used to identify the upstream transcriptional regulators of SIGLEC10 in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the downstream biological functions it mediates. These findings were then validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The impact of Siglecg deficiency on the efficacy of immunotherapy and the activation of CD8+T cells was analyzed in mouse HNSCC tumor-bearing models. Results The expression of Siglec-G/10, rather than that of Siglec-15, was positively correlated with immune suppressive marker programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and was associated with cervical lymph node metastasis, poorer pathologic stage, and lower sensitivity to immunotherapy. Siglecg deficiency rescued the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment, as evidenced by decreased TAM-associated phenotype and increased CD8+T cell infiltration and activation, which inhibited tumor growth significantly. Single-cell sequence and transcription factor prediction revealed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) could induce Siglec-G/10 transcription. Interleukin (IL)-4 could upregulate Siglec-G/10 expression significantly via STAT6 activation, as proved by overexpression and inhibition of STAT6. Signal transduction mechanism revealed that Siglec-G/10 could promote TAM differentiation and activation via increasing HIF1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) expression. Furthermore, Siglecg deficiency could enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor, and increase the infiltration and cytotoxic functions of CD8+T cells. Conclusions Our results suggest that high Siglec-G/10 expression aggravates the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and impedes the immunotherapy efficacy in HNSCC, which indicates that targeting Siglec-G/10 may represent a promising therapeutic option for improving the immunotherapy efficacy in HNSCC.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes more than 90% of the primary tumor of the liver. Metabolic reprogramming is decisive in promoting HCC development. The new metabolic program drives the surrounding immune cells to an immune suppressive commitment, enabling tumor survival. The enhanced metabolic activity of cancer cells leads to competition for essential nutrients, depriving non-malignant cells of critical resources. Simultaneously, the accumulation of metabolic byproducts within the tumor microenvironment (TME) selectively favors innate immune responses while impairing adaptive immunity. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy underscore the importance of targeting both immune cell function and metabolic pathways. In this context, reprogramming the metabolism of effector and regulatory immune cells represents a promising therapeutic avenue. This review focuses on a relatively underexplored aspect of liver cancer immunology, the immunosuppressive role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) driven by metabolic alterations and how these mechanisms contribute to the suppression of effective anti-tumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that expand aberrantly in cancer and exhibit potent immunosuppressive properties. They contribute to tumor progression through both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Immunologically, MDSCs suppress antitumor responses by inhibiting effector cells such as T cells and NK cells, facilitating immune evasion. Nonimmunologically, they promote tumor growth and metastasis through processes such as the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. MDSC accumulation is closely linked to accelerated tumor progression, including resistance to both immunotherapies and conventional treatments, making these cells critical therapeutic targets. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MDSC‐targeted strategies to improve treatment efficacy. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and effectiveness in MDSC‐targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the origin, classification, and biological characteristics of MDSCs, their dual roles in tumor progression, and their clinical significance. We also discuss recent advances in clinical and preclinical studies, including both traditional targeted therapies and emerging innovative strategies. By integrating current findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of MDSCs in cancer and valuable insights for advancing cancer treatment and drug development.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-(L)1 pathways have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since last decade. However, the efficacy is still limited because the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts ICI-primed T cell immunity. Therefore, it is quite crucial to block the potential mechanisms in inducing immunosuppression to improve ICI efficacy. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 5 is an important immunosuppressive molecule expressed in a wide range of myeloid cells and predicts tumor progression. Our group was the first to report ILT5 expression in solid tumor cells (colorectal cancer). However, the expression and function of ILT5 in NSCLC are still unknown.
 Methods:
 ILT5 expression in NSCLC tissues and tumor cell lines was determined by PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of tumor-derived ILT5 on T-cell phenotypes and functions was evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. ILT5-regulated downstream signals and molecules were determined by RNA sequencing, PCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry. Tumor transplantation and immunotherapeutic models were established in C57/BL6 and NSG mice to explore the effect of ILT5 on tumor progression and the synergies of ILT5 blockade with ICIs.
 Results:
 ILT5 is highly expressed in NSCLC cells, predicting poor patient survival. ILT5 induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion rather than senescence and apoptosis in the TME. Mechanistically, ILT5 upregulated PD-L1 through the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn increased PD-1 expression in CD8
 +
 T cells and induced their exhaustion. PIR-B (ILT5 orthlog in mice) overexpression in mice induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion and tumor growth in vivo, while PIR-B knockdown had the opposite effect. More importantly, inhibition of ILT5 synergistically enhanced the tumoricidal effect of PD-1 inhibitor in NSCLC immunotherapeutic models.
 Conclusions:
 Enriched ILT5 expression in NSCLC cells induces CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion via activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR-PD-L1 pathway. ILT5 inhibition synergistically enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor. Our findings identifies a novel mechanism for tumor immunosuppression and develops a promising strategy for improving ICI efficacy.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is driven by abnormal type-I and -II interferon activation, affecting a variety of immunocompetent cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modulate inflammation but often lack consistent potency. We developed HXB-319, an MSC-based therapy targeting inflammatory pathways in SLE. Previously, HXB-319 was shown to reduce alveolar hemorrhage in an SLE model. Here, we report its effects in a model of SLE that progresses to end stage kidney disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
SLE-like disease was induced via intraperitoneal (IP) pristane injection in female BALB/cJ mice, followed by treatment with naïve MSCs or HXB-319. Over 9 months, survival and proteinuria were monitored. Upon euthanasia, kidneys were analyzed for histopathology and gene expression, splenocytes for immune subsets by flow cytometry, and serum for autoantibodies, growth factors and cytokines.


RESULTS
HXB-319 significantly altered plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4+PD-L1+ cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ RORγt+ (Th17 cells) subsets. HXB-310 lowered IFN-γ (p< 0.001), IL-17A (p=0.01), BAFF (p<0.05), and anti-dsDNA (p<0.05), compared to untreated mice. HXB-319, but not naïve MSCs, significantly improved survival, halted progression of kidney disease and stabilized proteinuria (all p < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
HXB-319 demonstrates potential for mitigating SLE associated glomerulonephritis, improving survival and reducing proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The thymus exhibits constitutive activation of nearly all major inflammatory pathways, including sterile MyD88‐dependent signaling and interferon production by mTECs, the presence of cellular and molecular components of type 1, type 2, and type 3 responses, as well as sustained B cell activation. The reasons for the existence of such a complex constitutively active inflammatory network at the site of T cell development—where the initial pathogen encounter is unlikely—have remained enigmatic. We propose that this inflammatory thymic ‘ecosystem’ has evolved to promote immunological tolerance to ‘inflammatory self’—endogenous molecules absent from most peripheral tissues at steady state but upregulated during pathogen invasion. The spatial and temporal overlap with pathogen presence makes the discrimination of the inflammatory self from pathogen‐derived molecules a unique challenge for the adaptive immune system. The frequent occurrence of diseases associated with autoantibodies against proinflammatory cytokines underscores the persistent risk of these molecules being misidentified as foreign. Their abundant representation in the thymus, therefore, is likely to be critical for maintaining tolerance. This review explores current insights into the thymic inflammatory network, its cellular and molecular constituents, and their role in the induction of T cell tolerance.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in supporting acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance through various mechanisms, including the release of soluble factors, direct cell-cell interactions, and the creation of a leukemia-supportive niche. Conversely, MSCs also demonstrate potential inhibitory effects on AML, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and the modulation of immune responses. These contrasting effects highlight the complexities of MSC-AML interactions and emphasize the need for further research to understand their therapeutic potential fully. Targeting MSCs represents a promising avenue for AML treatment. Strategies aimed at modifying MSC-mediated support of AML cells, such as inhibiting pro-survival signaling pathways, disrupting the leukemia-supportive niche, and enhancing the immune-stimulatory functions of MSCs, could offer novel therapeutic approaches. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of current research. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the dual effects of MSCs in AML, to identify biomarkers that predict patient response to MSC-targeted therapies, and to develop strategies to overcome potential challenges associated with MSC-based interventions. In conclusion, understanding the multifaceted role of MSCs in AML pathogenesis is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. By harnessing the potential of MSCs and targeting their interactions with AML cells, we can explore novel strategies to improve treatment outcomes and enhance the overall management of this challenging hematological malignancy.

        <tr id="Dickkopf-1(DKK1) is a classical Wnt antagonist, which is released at the initiation of Leishmania major infection through platelet TLR1/2 activation. Using BALB/c mice deficient in platelet MyD88 (MyD88PKO) or platelet DKK1 (DKK1PKO), we assessed whether the transmission of activation signals through MyD88 and subsequent release of DKK1 are critical in regulating the immune response to L. major. At the site of infection, the levels of neutrophil platelet aggregates and activated neutrophils of MyD88(PKO) and DKK1(PKO) mice were reduced. Further, these mice mounted anti-leishmanial Th1-responses and failed to develop progressive lesions. In contrast, WT BALB/c-infected mice developed progressive disease associated with elevated IL-10-producing Th1 and Th2 T cells. Further, elevated CD206+ M2 macrophages and tolerogenic DC-10 cells, which favor parasite proliferation, were observed. In vitro, DKK1 promoted DC IL-10 production and blocked TNFα-induction of IL-12. Overall, these results indicate that platelet-DKK1 promotes disease progression through the induction of tolerogenic DCs and subsequent pathological Th2 and IL-10-Th1 T cell-responses. Summary statement Platelet DKK1 produced in response to TLR1/2 signaling by Leishmania parasites drives development of non-healing responses.

 Background:
 Antitumor immunity has become a critical focus in improving Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) patient outcomes. Among various immune features, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have emerged as crucial players in tumor immunity. Nevertheless, the specific role of B cells within TLS and their interaction with naive T cells in PSCC remain largely unclear. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the role of CD74⁺ B cells in TLS and their impact on immune regulation in PSCC.
 Methods:
 Spatial transcriptomics produced 519,608 cellular profiles from tumor samples of 18 patients. Additionally, scRNA-seq on tissues from 21 patients yielded 150,540 cells. Bulk RNA-seq was performed on tissues from 55 patients. TLS were identified and visualized using the DBSCAN algorithm, which clusters B cells, T cells, and DCs. Survival analyses were conducted to examine the association between TLS density and patient outcomes. Moreover, immune activity and cell infiltration were assessed via AUCell and CIBERSORT, while pseudotime analysis was used to explore dynamic gene expression changes during cell development. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis identified key signaling pathways, and intercellular signaling was analyzed through cell communication models.
 Results:
 TLS, accurately identified using the DBSCAN algorithm, were significantly associated with improved prognosis in PSCC patients (Internal cohort, n = 152, P < 0.01; External cohort, n=63, P < 0.05). The spatial distribution, a high density of B cells was observed within the TLS regions. Notably, CD74⁺ B cells were enriched within TLS, particularly during early developmental stages. Mapped the spatially in situ developmental trajectory of CD74⁺ B cells and uncovered the dynamic changes in gene expression throughout their maturation process, we observed that CD74⁺ B cells within the TLS of PSCC patients predominantly exhibited features of early developmental stages. In line with this, scRNA-seq data further validated these observations. These cells, through their HLA molecules, interacted with CD4/CD8 ligands on naive T cells, thereby activating critical transcription factors such as NFKB1, NFKB2, NFATC1, NFATC2, FOS, and RUNX1. This interaction ultimately amplified immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, patients with higher CD74⁺ B cell expression exhibited better responses to immunotherapy (pCR : P < 0.01and CR: P < 0.01) and underscoring the therapeutic relevance of these cells.
 Conclusions:
 By activating naive T cells through antigen presentation, CD74⁺ B cells within TLS significantly enhance local immune responses in PSCC. Thus, CD74⁺ B cells not only serve as a promising biomarker but also represent a potential therapeutic target, providing novel insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying PSCC progression and response to immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus infection affecting half of the world’s population for which therapies are lacking. The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional T and NK-cell signatures underpin dengue pathogenesis and may represent novel targets for immunomodulatory therapy in dengue.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and therapeutic resistance are profoundly influenced by the dynamic interplay within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The HCC TME comprises a complex network of cellular components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, tumor-associated macrophages, and infiltrating immune cells, alongside non-cellular factors such as extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, and angiogenic mediators. These elements collectively promote immune evasion, stromal remodeling, and neovascularization, driving tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance. Emerging evidence suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may offer a promising strategy to reprogram the immunosuppressive HCC TME through multimodal mechanisms, such as immunomodulation to enhance anti-tumor immunity and deplete regulatory cell populations, stromal normalization to attenuate fibroblast activation and pathological matrix deposition, and anti-angiogenic effects to restrict tumor vascularization. Notably, TCM compounds exhibit synergistic potential when combined with conventional therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and cytotoxic regimens, potentially enhancing efficacy while mitigating adverse effects. However, key challenges persist, such as intratumoral heterogeneity, pharmacokinetic variability of herbal formulations, and the need for rigorous preclinical-to-clinical translation. Future investigations should prioritize systems-level dissection of TCM-mediated TME modulation using omics technologies, rational design of TCM-based combination therapies guided by mechanistic studies, and standardization of clinically translatable TCM regimens. This review synthesizes current understanding of TME-driven HCC pathogenesis and highlights the emerging paradigm of TCM as a complementary modality to recalibrate the tumor-immune-stroma axis for improved therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory B cell (Breg), known for its immunosuppressive properties through the provision of IL-10, plays a critical role in the control of inflammatory diseases. Although Breg has been discovered for over two decades in mammals, its existence in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the differentiation mechanism and functional profiles of teleost CD25L+ Breg to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Breg. Methods Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, qPCR, morphological analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, recombinant IL-35 stimulation, cell co-culture in Transwell system were performed to reveal the phenotypic features, differentiation mechanism and suppressive functions of teleost CD25L+ Breg. To elucidate the immunoregulatory role of CD25L+ Breg in vivo, bacterial infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models were established in teleost fish. Systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements. Results Phenotypically, we identified a unique IgM+CD25L+ B cell subset, termed CD25L+ B cells, characterized by their capacity to produce IL-10 and IL-12p35 in a cold-blooded vertebrate, the grass carp. Mechanistically, IL-35 stimulation induced the differentiation of CD25L− B cells into CD25L+ B cells, promoting the production of IL-35 and IL-10 via STAT3 activation. Functionally, teleost CD25L+ B cells served as a conventional Breg subtype that exerted its immunosuppressive functions on effector T cells and neutrophils via cell contact or cytokine delivery. Upon bacterial infection, CD25L+ Breg increased earlier than CD25L+ Treg and produced IL-10. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model, Breg frequency and IL-10 levels increased significantly during IBD remission, and Breg adoptive transfer could prevent IBD development and contribute to intestinal tissue repair. Conclusions These novel findings reveal that fish have evolved Breg with specialized anti-inflammatory functions, providing evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic origin and functional conservation of Breg from fish to mammals.

        <tr id="Influenza-associated bacterial super-infections in the lung lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly all people have pre-existing memory to influenza virus, which can protect against subsequent infection in the lung. This study explored the role B cells play in protection against bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae) super-infection with previous heterotypic influenza memory. B cell deficiency resulted in an increased inflammatory lung environment and lung tissue injury during super-infection. Loss of B cells increased populations of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung and these CD8+ T cells were transcriptionally and functionally distinct from WT mice. Use of antibody-deficient mouse models showed that this phenotype was specifically due to loss of antibody production from B cells. Passive immunization with influenza-antibody serum in B cell deficient mice rescued the CD8+ T cell phenotype. CD8+ T cell depletion and lethal super-infection challenge experiments showed that the cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells from B cell deficient mice protect against super-infection bacterial burden and mortality. These findings provide insight into the importance of B cells for regulating immune responses against infection.">

        <tr id="While Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy may result in durable remissions in recurrent large B cell lymphoma, persistence is limited and the mechanisms underlying long-term response are not fully elucidated. Using longitudinal single-cell immunoprofiling, here we compare the immune landscape in durable remission versus early relapse patients following CD19 CAR T cell infusion in the NCT02348216 (ZUMA-1) trial. Four weeks post-infusion, both cohorts demonstrate low circulating CAR T cells. We observe that long-term remission is associated with elevated native cytotoxic and proinflammatory effector cells, and post-infusion clonotypic expansion of effector memory T cells. Conversely, early relapse is associated with impaired NK cell cytotoxicity and elevated immunoregulatory cells, potentially dampening native T cell activation. Thus, we suggest that durable remission to CAR T is associated with a distinct T cell signature and pattern of clonotypic expansion within the native T cell compartment post-therapy, consistent with their contribution to the maintenance of response.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages exhibit remarkable functional plasticity by dynamically polarizing into proinflammatory or antiinflammatory subsets in response to microenvironmental cues. This duality underpins their pivotal roles in immune defense, tissue homeostasis, and disease progression; however, the molecular mechanisms governing their polarization and crosstalk across various pathologies remain incompletely defined. This review systematically delineates macrophage biology, emphasizing the interplay between subset‐specific signaling networks and their context‐dependent activation in both health and disease. The heterogeneity of macrophages is characterized by detailing the distinctions between tissue‐resident and monocyte‐derived origins, as well as their polarization states. Core pathways regulating phagocytosis, tissue repair, immune modulation, and neuroprotection are dissected, along with their dysregulation in autoimmune disorders, neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. Notably, microenvironmental factors such as damage‐associated molecular patterns, pathogen‐associated molecular patterns, and metabolic intermediates dynamically reshape macrophage phenotypes through NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)‐mediated transcriptional control. Preclinical and clinical evidence underscores potential therapeutic targets and emerging strategies. The significance of this review lies in its integrative analysis of signaling crosstalk, paradoxical pathway roles, and translational implications for precision therapies. These insights into macrophage functions and signaling pathways provide a robust foundation for future disease intervention and personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="Background A head and neck cancer organoid (HNCO) and peripheral blood T cell co-culture model was established to investigate whether HNCOs can induce the differentiation of peripheral blood T cells into tumor-reactive T cells. Additionally, this study seeks to explore the cytotoxicity of these T cells against autologous tumor organoids, providing theoretical and experimental evidence for the feasibility of this model as a platform for adoptive cell immunotherapy in head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods HNCO single cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) collected and isolated from patients with HNC. The culture supernatant was collected and assayed for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α). The expression of T cell activation markers cluster of differentiation (CD)137 and CD107a was measured by flow cytometry to confirm tumor specificity and cytotoxicity. Additionally, the optimal effector-to-target (E/T) ratio was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and HNCO killing was quantified by fluorescent labeling. Results Of the 27 successfully established HNCO-T cell co-culture systems, 81.48% induced the in vitro differentiation and tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell expansion capable of mediating the killing of mature HNCOs. Conclusion The patient-derived HNCO-T cell co-culture model effectively induced PBL differentiation into tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells with enhanced tumor-killing activities. This model serves as a novel in vitro preclinical tool for advancing personalized adoptive immunotherapy in HNC.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of the tumor-immune ecosystem is crucial for advancing neoadjuvant strategies in cancer treatment. This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty patients underwent combination therapy. Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment. Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles. Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed. Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45+ cells and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) scores were observed in the hypo- and lymphoid-inflamed groups, whereas the myeloid-inflamed group showed minimal changes. After treatment, increased calreticulin expression in tumor cells, together with increased lymphoid cell lineages, was observed in non-recurrent cases. The myeloid-inflamed group exhibited higher expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2, suggesting the presence of a hypoxic and metastasis-promoting environment. Spatial analysis revealed that responders had a high infiltration of T cells within tumor cell nests, whereas non-responders had fewer T cells, with β-catenin expression in cancer cells. Upregulated lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the myeloid-inflammation group, and PD-L1 dynamics suggest potential targets for further therapy. These findings highlight the need for targeted neoadjuvant strategies based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Background: The STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) pathway plays a vital role in the body’s innate immune defense system, primarily involved in DNA sensing and type I interferon production. While STING is well-established in various immune cells, its role in natural killer (NK) cells, particularly within the context of liver fibrosis, remains inadequately explored. Aim: The current study investigates the relationship between STING expression, NK cell activity, and insulin receptor (IR) signaling in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Methods: Peripheral NK cells were isolated from healthy controls and MASH patients with varying stages of liver fibrosis (early: F1/F2; advanced: F3/F4). The expressions of STING, IR, NK cell activation markers (CD107a, NKp46), and NK cell inhibitory markers (LAIR-1, Siglec-7) were assessed using flow cytometry. NK cell cytotoxicity against primary hepatic stellate cells (pHSCs) was evaluated through apoptosis assays. STING agonists (2′3′-cGAMP and DMXAA) were used to stimulate NK cells, and their effects on STING expression, NK cell activation, and cytotoxicity were measured. Additionally, the impact of insulin signaling on STING expression and NK cell function was examined. Results: Our results demonstrate that STING expression in NK cells correlates with disease severity in liver fibrosis. NK cells from MASH patients with advanced fibrosis (F3/F4) showed inhibited STING protein levels that were statistically comparable to healthy NK cells and accompanied by impaired cytotoxicity and decreased IFN-γ production. In contrast, NK cells from early fibrosis (F1/F2) exhibited higher STING expression and better functional activity. STING agonist treatment (2′3′-cGAMP) restored STING expression and enhanced NK cell activity across all fibrosis stages. Furthermore, insulin treatment and combined insulin and 2′3′-cGAMP treatment synergistically upregulated both IR and STING expressions, leading to improved NK cell function and increased cytotoxicity, particularly in advanced fibrosis. Conclusion: Our results highlight the potential of targeting STING and insulin signaling pathways as a therapeutic approach in restoring NK cell function and enhance immune surveillance in liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterized by dysbiosis, persistent inflammation, and permanent structural airway damage. Neutrophilic inflammation is a key pathogenic feature, as indicated by enhanced neutrophil-derived proteases and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), associated with poor prognosis. However, recent studies have identified an eosinophilic endotype in up to 30% of patients, characterized by higher levels of type 2 (T2) cytokines and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The role of T helper (Th) cells in the dysregulated inflammatory environment of bronchiectasis remains unclear. Evidence suggests that persistent bacterial infection can skew adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 response, while the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis is also a critical regulator of chronic inflammation. T regulatory (Treg) cells have been shown to play a protective role against excessive chronic inflammation by modulating the function of several types of effector cells, including the Th17 subset. However, the capacity of this subset to delay or prevent disease progression remains to be determined Microbial dysbiosis, with loss of diversity and increased quantity of bacterial pathogens, may also be important for disease progression, and emerging evidence indicates that distinct inflammatory endotypes associate with specific microbiota alterations, especially in severe disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the immune cells and cytokine signaling that are involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Additionally, we present the main endotypes of bronchiectasis and explore the relationships between the type of inflammation and alterations in microbiota, as well as the potential benefits of targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms for the management of bronchiectasis. This review also examines how bacterial infection can shift adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 responses, the role of the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis in chronic inflammation and the potential protective role of Treg cells against excessive inflammation. Novel therapeutic strategies are highlighted, with focus on targeting specific cytokine signaling pathways and restoring Th17/Treg balance These developments underscore a shift toward precision medicine in bronchiectasis, emphasizing the importance of identifying specific inflammatory endotypes to tailor treatment strategies effectively.">

        <tr id="Background Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and aggressive pediatric bone malignancy with poor prognosis, driven by therapy-resistant tumor microenvironments (TME). The TME plays a critical role in tumor progression through a complex and dynamic network of reciprocal interactions among immune cells (dysfunctional T cells, immunosuppressive macrophages), stromal components (cancer-associated fibroblasts), and tumor cells. These interactions collectively shape the immune landscape, promote immune evasion, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Identifying reliable prognostic markers remains a critical challenge. Methods Here we performed an integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, WGCNA, and bulk RNA-seq analyses to investigate tumor-immune interactions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) intersected with T cell markers identified a total of 174 T cell-associated genes. Functional enrichment analysis and molecular subtyping were performed to explore immune-related pathways. A prognostic model based on CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 was constructed using Cox regression and validated in external datasets. Immune infiltration was assessed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Results T cell marker analyses revealed key roles in pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling and immune modulation. Molecular subtyping identified two clusters with distinct immune microenvironments: Cluster C1 (immunosuppressive phenotype and poorer prognosis) and Cluster C2 (functionally active immune profile associated with better prognosis). The prognostic model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival (AUC: 0.85, 0.82, 0.78). Additionally, a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) with low survival rate has been observed in High-risk group. Immune infiltration analysis showed higher CD8+ T cell and dendritic cell activity and immune checkpoint expression in low-risk groups. Experimental validation demonstrated that ID3 silencing inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in ES cell lines. Conclusion Together, our study identified CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 as key T cell associated prognostic markers and developed a validated model to predict survival outcomes in ES. Insights into T cell markers and tumor-immune dynamics offer promising advances in prognostic assessment and immunotherapy for ES. Furthermore, the role of ID3 in immune evasion and tumor proliferation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, providing new avenues for immune checkpoint regulation and personalized treatment strategies.">

 Background:
 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is typically reversible in CAR-T therapy, while hyperinflammatory syndromes like macrophage activation-like syndrome (MAS-L) and high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early interventions are critical for improving outcomes. We aim to analyze clinical cytokine assays and cellular phenotypes early in hyperinflammatory syndromes to identify profiles for severe cases to inform management decisions.
 Methods:
 This study included 113 CAR-T patients (pt) (September 2019-March 2024) with cytokine profiles (CP) performed at the second tocilizumab dose or with suspected hyperinflammatory states (CP1), followed by assessments at 24 hours (CP24) and 48 hours (CP48). 52 pts consented to blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cell immune phenotyping at pre-treatment (pre-LD) and day 1 for PB.
 Results:
 Among the 113 pts, CRS pts (N=74), when compared to MAS-L(N=19) & IEC-HS (N=20) at CP1, had lower levels of TNF (median in pg/mL; 31, 62.9, 47.7) , IL-18 (794, 1353, 2011), and MCP-1 (689, 2722, 2485.5). While MAS-L and IEC-HS had similar CP1 profiles, CP24 and CP48 differed between them: TNF & MCP-1 levels decreased in MAS-L but remained elevated or increased in IEC-HS. IL-18 was stable in MAS-L but increased steadily daily in IEC-HS. Infections were more frequent in IEC-HS (CRS: 43%; MAS-L: 58%; IEC-HS: 85%; p=0.002). Notably, patients who died with persistent
 E. faecium
 bacteremia had higher IL-18 in CP48. In the 52 pts with cell phenotypes available by flow, 33 had CRS, 18 MAS-L and 8 IEC-HS. The correlation between cell phenotypes and cytokine levels showed that elevated TNF at CP1 correlated with increased non-classical monocytes in pre-LD BM and higher NK and NK-T cells in pre-LD PB. Similarly, elevated IL-18 CP48 levels correlated with increased CD8 T-cells, NK-T cells, and intermediate monocytes in pre-LD PB, as well as increased NK cells at both pre-LD and day 1 (Table).
 Conclusions:
 We report distinct cytokine profiles in IEC-HS early in the inflammatory course post-CAR-T therapy. These elevated cytokines correlate with specific immune cell subsets, including BM-resident monocytes, intermediate monocytes with heightened cytokine trafficking and inflammatory capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility for identifying potential biomarkers for early risk stratification and targeted interventions.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematological cancer in people living with (PLWH), and most B-cell NHLs express CD20. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized vesicles released by cells into the extracellular environment. Here, we examined the association between plasma-derived CD20+ EVs and prognostic biomarkers in the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) 034 trial. We isolated EVs from plasma of patients with AIDS-NHL before and after initiation of treatment (rituximab plus concurrent infusional EPOCH), measuring CD20 on EVs by ELISA. Ramos cells were treated with EVs isolated from NHL and AIDS-NHL lymphoma cell lines in the presence of rituximab to measure if EVs protect cells from rituximab cytotoxicity. Baseline plasma levels of CD20+ EVs were significantly higher in non-responders and in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with high International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores (2 to 3) compared to those with lower IPI scores (0 to 1). Moreover, baseline plasma levels of CD20+ EVs were significantly associated with baseline levels of prognostic biomarkers for AIDS-NHL. We further demonstrate that EVs from NHL and AIDS-NHL cell lines can sequester rituximab and inhibit apoptosis.

        <tr id="Innate immune memory (trained immunity) refers to the ability of innate immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, to retain a long-term imprint of a prior stimulus through epigenetic and metabolic adaptations, enabling amplified responses upon restimulation. Recent studies have classified innate immune memory into central and peripheral types. Central innate immune memory originates in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the bone marrow, where epigenetic reprogramming generates a sustained inflammatory bias, contributing to chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and stroke. Peripheral innate immune memory occurs in monocytes or macrophages that acquire heightened responsiveness after repeated exposure to stimuli in peripheral tissues. This review explores the mechanisms underlying both central and peripheral innate immune memory, their roles in chronic inflammatory diseases, focusing on cardiovascular diseases, and potential strategies to target innate immune memory for therapeutic purposes. Advancing the understanding of these processes could facilitate the development of novel approaches to control inflammatory diseases and immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignant tumor that imposes heavily public health burdens worldwide. Systemic therapies for gastric cancer (GC), such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have undergone significant advancements. Nevertheless, the extensive application of anti-cancer agents has resulted in an increasing array of challenges related to drug resistance, presenting a substantial barrier in GC treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as essential immunomodulators within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of GC, providing novel therapeutic targets due to their capacity for plasticity in reaction to environmental signals. They create a complex network of communication with various immune and stromal cell types, thereby contributing to the immunosuppressive nature of the TME in GC. In this review, we establish the map of the origin and polarization of macrophages in GC. During the process of carcinogenesis, macrophages undergo dynamic phenotypic transitions. Additionally, the interactions between TAMs and tumor cells significantly influence the progression of GC, affecting tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, this intricate immunomodulatory axis notably enhances resistance to immunotherapy, suggesting that targeting TAMs presents substantial therapeutic opportunities for patients with GC. Approaches such as TAM elimination, TAM repolarization, and CAR-M therapy have been validated in numerous studies. We also elaborate on the challenges faced by the development of targeting TAMs, which may provide innovative perspectives on the GC treatment.">

In response to serum starvation, tumor cells upregulate cholesterol biogenesis pathways as a compensatory mechanism.

        <tr id="Introduction The pathogenesis of biliary atresia (BA) is unclear to date and no therapies targeting immune regulatory pathways exist. Here we characterized potent effector liver tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) and monocytic cells in children with advanced BA and an age-matched control group to gain insight into BA pathogenesis and immunologic regulation. Methods Liver explants from 18 children with biliary atresia and 10 with metabolic disease and normal histology were analyzed ex vivo by multicolor flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Cytokines and cytotoxic mediators were quantified by intracellular staining and bead-based arrays in culture supernatant. Results The frequency of CD103+CD69+CD8+ Trm cells and CD14+CD16+ monocytes was significantly higher in BA than in the control group. In BA, T cells showed elevated expression of CD103, CD69, CD39 and production of TNF-α and Granzyme-B ex vivo, which could be reproduced in vitro by allowing cell-contact with monocytes. Conclusions Cytotoxic CD8+ Trm cells and intrahepatic monocytes might contribute to tissue destruction in BA. Therapies targeting Trm cells or the TNF-α signaling pathway could be explored to delay progression to cirrhosis in BA.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating antigen presentation, allowing them to escape detection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and resist immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs), one of the potent antigen-presenting cells in cancer immunity, are essential for initiating adaptive immune responses. Unfortunately, DC functions are disrupted by the tumor microenvironment. Suppressive cytokines, for instance, can impair DC maturation, reduce antigen-presenting capacity, or induce DC apoptosis. A novel strategy against such challenges is reprogramming cancer cells into DC-like cells. By inducing transcription factors, cancer cells can be directed to develop a DC phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced antigen-presenting markers, co-stimulatory molecules, and an increased ability to prime naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing enhanced immune activation and tumor regression. However, limitations remain, including reprogramming efficiency, tumor heterogeneity, and safety issues that require further refinement. This review provides fundamental knowledge about DC in the tumor microenvironment and cell fate reprogramming, recent advances in reprogramming cancer cells into DCs, and eventually discusses perspectives for translating this approach into clinical settings. This innovative reprogramming strategy holds the potential to overcome current limitations in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel avenue for durable anti-tumor immunity">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key players in the immune system, exhibiting remarkable plasticity that allows them to influence cancer progression in opposing ways. Their polarization into M1 or M2 subtypes dictates their impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME). M1 macrophages, characterized by pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor functions, release cytokines that enhance immune responses and promote tumor destruction. Conversely, M2 macrophages support tumor growth by facilitating angiogenesis, immune suppression, and tissue remodeling, thereby creating a favorable environment for cancer progression. Further classification of M2 macrophages into subtypes M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d underscores their diverse roles in tumor development, metastasis, and immune evasion. Given their crucial role in shaping the TME, macrophages have become a major focus in cancer research. Recent therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram macrophages, shifting their phenotype from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressive.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are pivotal cell populations involved in the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is driven by systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This study aims to characterize the immune landscape in ACLF and identify potential therapeutic targets.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
We employed single-cell RNA sequencing, visium spatial sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis to profile immune cells in ACLF livers compared to acute liver failure (ALF), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and controls. ACLF livers exhibited a distinct immune signature with increased neutrophils, particularly CCL4+ subsets, which drive unresolved inflammation by recruiting additional neutrophils and inflammatory CD14+S100A9+ monocytes. Resident Kupffer cells were reduced, and monocytes differentiated into TREM2+ macrophages with an M1-like pro-inflammatory phenotype, exacerbating inflammation. Additionally, lymphoid cells showed significant dysfunction, with reduced NK cells and relatively expanded T cells exhibiting diminished cytotoxicity or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Cell-cell communication analysis identified the ANXA1-FPR1 axis as a key interaction between T cells and myeloid cells, serving as a negative feedback mechanism to dampen inflammation. Plasma and hepatic ANXA1 levels were elevated in ACLF patients, correlating with disease severity. In preclinical model, the ANXA1 peptide Ac2-26 improved liver function, reduced inflammation, and promoted macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. In vitro, Ac2-26 inhibited CCL4-mediated monocyte chemotaxis and M1 polarization, effects partially blocked by the FPR1 inhibitor Randialic acid B. Mechanically, Ac2-26 activated AMPK and inhibited mTOR signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide a comprehensive immune profile in ACLF and highlight ANXA1 as a potential therapeutic target for resolving immune dysregulation and improving outcomes in ACLF.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Abstract Cervical cancer progression is not solely driven by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection but is profoundly influenced by the local immune microenvironment, particularly chronic cytokine imbalances. Unlike the acute cytokine storms observed in infections or sepsis, cervical cancer is characterized by a persistent, low-grade, “smoldering inflammatory response” that fuels tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8 sustain a tumor-supportive milieu, promoting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and resistance to apoptosis, while immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β dampen anti-tumor immune responses and facilitate immune escape. This review explores chronic cytokine dysregulation in cervical cancer, examining how the prolonged, dysregulated cytokine network shapes the tumor microenvironment, remodels stromal interactions, and influences immune cell recruitment and function. We highlight key cytokines involved in these processes and discuss their clinical significance as potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Understanding these sustained inflammatory processes is critical because they represent a distinct biological landscape compared to acute inflammatory reactions and offer unique windows for therapeutic intervention. The paper reviewed emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these chronic cytokine pathways, including cytokine blockade, immune modulation, and combination approaches integrating immunotherapies or nanomedicine. Addressing chronic cytokine dysregulation holds promise for improving cervical cancer management and patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Problem Unbalanced production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells is a hallmark of endometriosis. IL-24, a member of the IL-10 family, is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by both non-immune cells like astrocytes, keratinocytes, pancreatic myofibroblasts, and endothelial cells and immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, T cells (including Th2 and Th17), and B cells. However, its expression in regulatory T (Tregs) and B lymphocytes (Bregs) has not been explored. In this study, we determined the expression of IL-24 in Tregs and selected Breg subpopulations in women with endometriosis compared with healthy women. Methods Percentages of Tregs, B10 cells, immature B cells, and plasmablasts that produce IL-24 were measured in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis (n=24) and healthy women (n=24) using flow cytometry. Results We observed an increased percentage of IL-24–producing Tregs in the total pool of women with endometriosis and in women with stages III and IV of endometriosis compared to controls. Within the Breg subpopulations, the percentages of IL-24–producing plasmablasts were higher in the overall endometriosis cohort as well as in women with stage IV endometriosis compared with healthy women. In contrast, the percentages of IL-24–producing immature B cells were lower in the endometriosis group than that in the control group. Conclusions We have shown, for the first time, that Tregs and Bregs secrete IL-24 and that their percentages are altered in endometriosis. The significance of this cytokine secretion by regulatory cells is unclear, but we speculated that IL-24 may enhance the improper immunosuppressive activity of Tregs and plasmablasts in endometriosis, which enables the implantation and growth of endometrial lesions outside the uterus.">

        <tr id="The role of extracellular vesicles has been extensively studied in physiological and pathological conditions, and growing evidence has pinpointed them as key players in tumor progression, regulation of the metastatic niche, and modulation of anti-tumor immune responses. Indeed, a dynamic transfer of extracellular vesicles between cancer cells and immunological or non-immunological cells homing in the tumor microenvironment exists, and the balance between their release by cancer cells and by normal cells determines cancer progression. Here, we focused on the role of extracellular vesicles in the dysregulation of the bone marrow environment in pediatric tumors such as acute leukemias and neuroblastomata, whose poor prognosis is strictly related to the involvement of such anatomical site. Acute leukemias arise from bone marrow progenitors, whereas approximately 50% of neuroblastoma patients have bone marrow metastases at diagnosis. Thus, here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the bone marrow dysregulation in pediatric acute leukemias and neuroblastomata with particular emphasis on the involvement of extracellular vesicles.">

        <tr id="Background Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) mediate cancer immune suppression by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that inhibits effective anti-tumor immunity. However, they are still a poorly understood, heterogeneous mix of neutrophil subsets. This study aims to determine the Siglec expression profile on several neutrophil subsets and assess their immunosuppressive ability. Methods We identified CD16high and CD16low neutrophil subsets from the low-density fractions of human peripheral blood and compared them to high-density neutrophils. We profiled the expression of the entire family of Siglecs on these three key neutrophil populations under steady-state conditions in healthy subjects as well as cancer patients. Moreover, the ability of these populations, isolated from healthy subjects, to suppress T cell proliferation was assessed. Results Two distinct subpopulations were investigated within the low-density fraction of human peripheral blood (CD15+CD66b+CD16low and CD15+CD66b+CD16high) and compared to high-density neutrophils (CD15+CD66b+CD16high). We found that in addition to CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglec-5/-14, -7, and -9, are differentially expressed on the CD16low and CD16high low-density subsets in both healthy, steady-state subjects, and cancer patients. Upregulated expression of CD33 on the CD16low cells led to the initial speculation that they are MDSCs. As the differential expression of Siglec-9 between these two populations was striking, we used CD16 and Siglec-9 double staining to quantify these populations, which demonstrated that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population is greatly upregulated in cancer patients. The CD16high low-density and high-density neutrophils, but not the CD16low low-density neutrophils from healthy subjects, inhibited T cell proliferation, indicating that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population are not MDSCs. Conclusions These results demonstrate that Siglecs are differentially expressed on neutrophil subsets, and along with CD16, may be used to help further define what is a PMN-MDSC. Consistent with current observations by others, PMN-MDSCs may encompass an array of neutrophil subtypes, including low-density neutrophils, and point to the need for more work to precisely define the genetic signatures of PMN-MDSCs.">

        <tr id="The integrin CD103 is an adhesion molecule that facilitates immune cell retention in epithelial tissues through its interaction with E-cadherin. It is a marker for certain CD8+ T-cell subpopulations and conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), but its presence on macrophages remains poorly characterized. Macrophage differentiation is influenced by M-CSF and GM-CSF, and we investigated whether macrophages can also express CD103 under inflammatory conditions. We examined baseline CD103 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) differentiated in M-CSF or GM-CSF and then stimulated them with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or examined them following viral infection. We found that CD103 is minimally expressed at baseline but is selectively upregulated in M-CSF-differentiated macrophages after stimulation with endosomal TLR agonists. Mechanistically, p38 MAPK inhibition prevented CD103 upregulation, suggesting that this process is mediated by p38 MAPK signaling. Furthermore, in vivo LCMV infection induced CD103 expression on peritoneal macrophages. These findings demonstrate that macrophages can express CD103 under specific inflammatory conditions, challenging the assumption that CD103 is restricted to T cells and dendritic cells. This study expands our understanding of CD103 beyond its recognized roles in T cells and DCs, providing new insight into its regulation by macrophages.">

 Background:
 Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are transient ectopic lymphoid aggregates composed of immune cells such as B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), and have been observed in various solid tumors. TLS are associated with favorable clinical outcomes. While TLS are believed to contribute to adaptive antitumor cellular and humoral responses, the mechanisms driving TLS formation and their immune regulatory functions in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remain poorly understood.
 Methods:
 We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from 86 MM patients and performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and multiplex IHC (mIHC) to assess TLS density, maturation, and distribution. Clinical data were integrated to investigate the relationship between TLS and patient prognosis in MM. Additionally, single-cell data from 20 patients were analyzed to explore the abundance of immune cell types and subtypes in the TIME at single-cell resolution, along with potential intercellular interactions.
 Results:
 Based on histopathological analysis of MM samples, patients were stratified into two groups: those poccessing TLS (TLS+, n = 44) and those lacking TLS (TLS-, n = 42). Across the entire cohort, the TLS+ group showed a trend toward improved overall survival (OS), though not statistically significant (p = 0.27). A higher proportion of advanced-stage (T3 and T4) patients in the TLS+ group (T1-T3a: TLS- = 12, TLS+ = 5; T3a-T4b: TLS- = 17, TLS+ = 21) may have influenced the prognostic value of TLS in the overall patient cohort. Further supporting this notion, subgroup analysis restricted to patients with AJCC stage IIB and IIC revealed significantly improved OS in the TLS+ group (p = 0.046). Single-cell data revealed significant differences in the abundance of immune-related cells between the TLS+ and TLS- groups. All B cell subtypes (naïve, memory, germinal center (GC), and plasma cells) were enriched in the TLS+ group compared to the TLS- group. CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells also exhibited similar trends, whereas the distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells was comparable between the two groups. Furthermore, plasma cells in the TLS+ group were predominantly IgG-producing. Intercellular communication analysis with B cells identified a CAF subpopulation highly expressing TLS-associated genes. A CCL19-CCR7 and CCL21-CCR7 chemokine axis from this CAF subpopulation was observed exclusively in TLS+ tumors but was deficient in TLS- tumors. Multiple T cell subsets exhibited high expression of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis when communicating with B cells.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings highlight the prognostic value of TLS in patients within MM. TLS formation may be associated with specific CAF and T cell subtypes and their interactions with B cells.

        <tr id="Type II testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid malignancies in young men and are classified into seminomas and non-seminomatous subtypes. Seminomas are known for their highly pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) with abundant immune cell infiltration. While previous work has demonstrated that the seminoma-derived cell line TCam-2 induces immune cell activation in co-culture and undergoes phenotypic changes itself, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. To explore the role of direct cell–cell interaction and the effects mediated by soluble mediators such as cytokines, we conducted co-culture experiments of TCam-2 cells with purified human T cells or monocytes, including Transwell assays and treatments with IL-6, TNFα, or their respective blocking antibodies Tocilizumab and Adalimumab. In this way, we found that immune cell activation, indicated by enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an upregulation of activation markers, strongly depended on direct physical contact between both cell types. Nonetheless, we also unveiled the role of soluble mediators in both immune cell activation and promoting a shift in TCam-2 cells from a seminoma-like phenotype to a more dedifferentiated phenotype, suggesting that cytokines critically shape the TME. These observations highlight the complexity of tumor–immune interactions in the seminoma microenvironment, offering new insight into immune-driven dynamics in TGCTs.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection. B-1a cells play a crucial role in maintaining immuno-physiologic homeostasis. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin G (Siglec-G) regulates B-1a cell’s behavior and function. Trogocytosis is the process by which one cell acquires portions of another cell’s plasma membrane and cytoplasm through direct contact. During sepsis, neutrophils accumulate in the lungs and serosal cavities, while B-1a cells decrease. We hypothesized that neutrophil-mediated trogocytosis causes B-1a cell depletion in sepsis, and that targeting this process could preserve B-1a cells and attenuate sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sepsis was induced in mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Twenty hours after CLP, B-1a cells (CD19+B220lo/-CD23-CD5+) in the pleural and peritoneal cavities were quantified, and neutrophil engulfment of B-1a cells as well as trogocytosis were assessed. We also examine the interaction between Siglec-G and the “don’t-eat-me” signal receptor, CD47. Our data showed that B-1a cell numbers and frequencies in the pleural and peritoneal cavities were significantly decreased in sepsis. Neutrophils co-cultured with B-1a cells significantly increased B-1a cell internalization via trogocytosis. We observed a strong binding interaction between Siglec-G and CD47, which facilitates neutrophil-mediated trogocytosis by compromising CD47 function. We discovered a novel 11-aa therapeutic peptide, named Compound 11 (C11), derived from the CD47 region interacting with Siglec-G. C11 effectively preserved B-1a cell populations, significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, alleviated ALI, and improved survival in sepsis. Our findings highlight the Siglec-G/CD47 axis on B-1a cells as a key regulator of neutrophil-mediated B-1a cell depletion. Targeting this pathway with C11 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune dysregulation and improve sepsis outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a frontline treatment for autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), due to its potent immunomodulatory properties. Efferocytosis, a crucial process for tissue homeostasis by transmitting immune-suppressive signals, is frequently impaired in SLE. We hypothesized HCQ enhances efferocytosis and mediates anti-inflammatory effects. Methods A pristane-induced lupus (PIL) mouse model was used to assess the preventive efficacy of HCQ by measuring inflammatory cytokine levels, autoantibody titers, and lupus nephritis severity. Efferocytosis in HCQ-treated macrophages was quantified following co-incubation with apoptotic cells and the expression levels of TAM family receptors post-HCQ stimulation were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. The role of MerTK on HCQ-modulated inflammation was revealed by MerTK inhibitor UNC2025. Results Long-term HCQ treatment in PIL mice significantly reduced disease activity. HCQ treatment enhanced efferocytosis in RAW264.7 cells, while peritoneal macrophages from HCQ-treated mice showed increased efferocytotic capacity compare to PIL mice. Additionally, HCQ upregulated the expression of the TAM receptor MerTK and Gas6 on macrophages, restoring MerTK levels suppressed by pristane in the spleen of PIL mice. Inhibition of MerTK signaling by UNC2025 mitigated HCQ-mediated enhancements in efferocytosis and reversed the reduction in inflammatory mediators including IL-6 and IFN-α. HCQ-induced anti-inflammatory markers, such as PPARγ, LXR, and IL-10, were also alleviated upon MerTK blockade. Conclusion This study provides robust in vitro and in vivo evidence that HCQ promotes macrophage efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory reprogramming via MerTK/Gas6 signaling, offering insights into potential therapeutic mechanisms in SLE management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

Myeloid cells, including macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, play pivotal roles in shaping the ovarian tissue microenvironment and regulating inflammatory responses. However, a comprehensive understanding of the roles of these cells in the ovarian aging process is lacking. To bridge this knowledge gap, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and flow cytometry analysis to functionally characterize CD45+ CD11b+ myeloid cell populations in young (3 months old) and aged (14-17 months old) murine ovaries. Our dataset unveiled the presence of five ovarian macrophage subsets, including a Cx3cr1lowCd81hi subset unique to the aged murine ovary. Most notably, our data revealed significant alterations in ANNEXIN and TGFβ signaling within aged ovarian myeloid cells, which suggest a novel mechanism contributing to the onset and progression of aging-associated inflammation and fibrosis in the ovarian tissue.">

        <tr id="Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is driven by an imbalance in the interaction among osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and immune cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. However, detailed single-cell transcriptomic data on the bone microenvironment of PMOP patients are lacking. This study characterized the cellular landscape of the bone marrow in PMOP and identified key osteoclastogenic pathways. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells from 10 PMOP patients and 10 controls (93 867 cells) was performed, complemented by histological validation and in vitro modulation of key pathways. The findings revealed elevated expression of cytokines and chemokines in specific cell subpopulations, including hematopoietic stem cells, B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and erythroid cells, which are likely to contribute to the promotion of osteoclastogenesis. Enhanced differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts was linked to elevated B cell communication. Furthermore, three monocyte subsets (THBS1+ with CCL20+, or LRP1+, or C1QA+) exhibited osteoclastogenic potential, associated with the activation of the NOD-like receptor pathway. Targeting THBS1 significantly reduced bone loss in PMOP mouse models. This study provides a detailed characterization of bone marrow cell heterogeneity in postmenopausal women, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting PMOP.">

        <tr id="Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for about 403,000 new cases and 175,000 deaths worldwide each year. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most prevalent subtype, is often driven by genetic mutations, such as VHL inactivation, leading to angiogenesis and immune escape. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 have transformed treatment paradigms, yet therapeutic resistance remains a critical challenge. The immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in ccRCC plays a central role in limiting ICI efficacy. Emerging strategies aim to overcome resistance by targeting key components of the TME, including tumor-associated macrophages, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and cytokine signaling. Agents such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab have demonstrated the ability to restore T-cell activity and mitigate immune suppression, offering clinical benefit in metastatic ccRCC. However, response rates vary, highlighting the need for rational combination therapies. ICIs combined with VEGF inhibitors have shown promising outcomes in clinical trials, and novel regimens continue to be explored. Risk stratification and personalized treatment selection are increasingly important as the therapeutic landscape evolves. This review synthesizes current advances in immunotherapy for ccRCC, with a focus on mechanisms of resistance and innovative strategies to enhance immune responsiveness. A deeper understanding of TME modulation and strategic combination approaches is essential to improve survival and quality of life for patients with advanced ccRCC.">

While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGFβ-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGFβ expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.">

        <tr id="The transformation of myeloid leukemia blasts into leukemia‑derived dendritic cells (DCleu) is a notable phenomenon. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in modulating physiological and pathological activities, particularly in immune activation. In the present study, EVs were isolated from DC/DCleu culture supernatants derived from healthy (H) donors (n=9) and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=9) using whole blood (WB) samples, both with and without Kit M (granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor and prostaglandin E1). This was followed by T‑cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) with Kit M‑treated and untreated WB. To assess the qualitative and quantitative differences in EVs between Kit M‑treated and untreated samples, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and multiplex bead‑based flow cytometry were employed. The present findings indicate that DC/MLC supernatant‑derived EVs can be successfully identified, quantified and characterized. Furthermore, these EVs exhibit regulatory properties in both H and AML samples. Results showed that a higher number of CD8+ EVs were detected after DC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Thrombocyte‑associated EVs (CD41b+, CD42a+ and CD62P+) significantly increased following DC culture in both groups. While low frequencies of progenitor/blast marker (CD133+) associated EVs were detected in H samples before and after DC culture, their frequencies increased after DC culture in AML samples. Additionally, a higher number of CD8+ and CD2+ EVs were observed after MLC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Correlation analyses revealed that improved blast lysis in Kit M‑pretreated samples (normalized to control) associated with the presence of EV subtypes associated with T (CD2+), B (CD20+, 24+), and other cell markers (for example, CD31+, CD146+, CD44+ and CD49e+). This comprehensive approach provides insights into the impact of Kit M on DC/DCleu generation and the subsequent activation of immune cells, leading to differences in EV production between H and AML samples.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with tumour growth, invasion, and treatment response heavily influenced by the tumour microenvironment (TME). The TME promotes tumour progression by creating an immunosuppressive environment that hampers the body’s antitumour immune response, primarily through the Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways. These pathways contribute to chronic inflammation, immune evasion, and angiogenesis. Targeting the TME and its signalling pathways has shown potential to enhance treatment efficacy. STAT3, a key transcription factor in lung cancer, drives tumour growth and immune suppression via the mTOR and JAK pathways. Inhibiting these pathways can block STAT3 and slow cancer progression. Promising results have been observed with mTOR inhibitors like CC-115 and Vistusertib, especially when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and with JAK inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib, AZD4205, and Filgotinib.

TIBs display considerable intratumor heterogeneity due to genetic variation, epigenetic differences and transcriptional plasticity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Owing to the unique anatomical location of CRC, the B cell subpopulation exhibits more extensive heterogeneity. Many studies have shown that TIBs have gradually become a key predictor of immunotherapy for malignant cancers, including CRC. TIBs have essential functions, including antigen presentation and antibody secretion, and they promote T-cell activation and myeloid chemotaxis. However, owing to the complex TME, TIBs not only promote the antitumor immune response but also inhibit the immune response. With the in-depth study of tumor-infiltrating T cells, tumor-associated myeloid cells and the interactions among these cells in the TME, the special role of immune cells in the TME has gradually become clear. However, the influence of TIBs in the TME and their interactions with nonimmune cells in the TME remain unclear.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the dominant immune cell subset within the ovarian tumor microenvironment, which exhibits remarkable plasticity. They can readily undergo polarization toward an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype in response to various factors secreted by tumor cells, playing a pivotal role in ovarian cancer advancement and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. M2 TAMs promote the invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells and their resistance to therapeutic agents through the secretion of numerous tumor-promoting factors, including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and exosomes. Furthermore, M2 TAMs significantly contribute to the peritoneal metastasis of cancer cells by aiding in the formation of spheroids and facilitating adhesion at metastatic sites. Concurrently, TAMs can suppress immune responses by interacting with lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, thereby fostering an immunosuppressive milieu. Extensive research has indicated that M2-like TAMs exert detrimental effects in ovarian tumors, with elevated levels correlating positively with diminished overall survival rates. This review seeks to summarize the existing knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which TAMs affect both the progression of ovarian cancer and the development of chemotherapy resistance, underscoring the necessity for innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting these cells within the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a key component of the innate immune system, have emerged as significant players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer. Traditionally recognized for their role in defending against infections, neutrophils in cancer contribute to both tumor progression and suppression, depending on their activation state and the signals they receive. Neutrophil-driven inflammation within the TME is critical in promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. This review explores the complex role of neutrophils in breast cancer, emphasizing the mechanisms through which they influence tumor inflammation, including their interactions with other immune cells and the signaling pathways involved. Neutrophils can either support tumor progression by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and reactive oxygen species, or contribute to antitumor responses by directly killing cancer cells and stimulating adaptive immunity. The balance between these opposing functions is heavily influenced by the TME’s cytokine milieu and neutrophil polarization. Key signaling pathways, such as the CXCR2-CXCL8 axis and interactions with tumor-associated macrophages, regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation in the TME, enhancing inflammation and tumorigenesis.

        <tr id="Eosinophils are increasingly recognized as adaptable immune cells that exhibit diverse phenotypes and effector functions across different tissues and disease states. While they can induce pathology through degranulation and cytotoxic mediator release, eosinophils also fulfill regulatory and tissue repair roles. Advances in single-cell and spatial technologies have begun to reveal how microenvironmental cues (including cytokines, chemokines, and cell–cell interactions) shape eosinophil behavior in health and disease. These insights are critical for understanding why certain patients respond variably to therapies targeting eosinophils and related type 2 pathways. By dissecting eosinophil heterogeneity in real human tissues, researchers may identify new biomarkers, refine endotyping approaches, and develop more precise therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes emerging concepts of eosinophil biology in inflammatory conditions, highlights the impact of spatial context on eosinophil functions, and discusses the future of advanced phenotyping in guiding personalized treatments.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The testicular immune microenvironment sustains homeostasis and immune privilege. However, the presence and functional significance of B cells within this specialized niche remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, the intricate crosstalk between resident immune populations and testicular stromal cells that may orchestrate the immunological and endocrine microenvironment during sexual maturation warrants systematic investigation.


OBJECTIVE
To systematically delineate the immune cell atlas and developmental trajectory of testicular leukocytes before and after sexual maturation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
An integrated analysis of leukocytes in post-sexual maturity (8-week-old) and pre-sexual maturity (2-week-old) mouse testes using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), was performed. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) isolated immune subsets, followed by bioinformatics interrogation of cellular heterogeneity and ligand-receptor network analysis to map intercellular communication pathways.


RESULTS
Through scRNA-seq clustering analysis, we resolved 18 distinct leukocyte populations (11 lymphoid and seven myeloid lineages), which were further validated and expanded to 17 phenotypically discrete subsets (eight lymphoid and nine myeloid) via high-dimensional CyTOF profiling. Notably, we identified a rare but functionally significant B lymphocyte population within the testicular compartment. The myeloid compartment exhibited pronounced developmental plasticity, marked by progressive Il1b+Macrophages diminution and regulatory T cell expansion during maturation. Cell communication network analysis revealed intensified ligand-receptor cross-talk between androgen-producing Leydig cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in post-pubertal testes, providing mechanistic insights into age-dependent immune privilege establishment.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Multi-omics integration reveals dynamic immune remodeling during testicular maturation. These findings underscore the potential involvement of B cells in local immune surveillance while identifying maturation-associated signaling axes between stromal and immune cells. This comprehensive mapping of testicular leukocyte dynamics significantly advances our understanding of reproductive immunology and lays foundation for investigating immune-mediated testicular pathologies.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells play pivotal immunological roles including direct cytotoxic effector function and secretion of inflammatory and immunomodulating cytokines. In the context of chronic inflammation, NK cell fitness decreases during disease progression through currently unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that Interleukin-35 (IL-35) inhibits human NK cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory, and cytotoxic functions, while promoting secretion of TGF-β and proangiogenic factors in vitro. We show prolonged exposure to IL-35 converts both conventional and adaptive NK cells into CD9+CD103+CD49a+ ILC1-like cells via autocrine TGF-β. We assess cancer patient-derived public datasets and reveal the presence of IL-35-producing cells and IL-35-receptor-expressing NK/ILC1-like cells within the tumor microenvironment and associate IL-35 with poor prognosis. Collectively, our findings identify and implicate IL-35 as a key driver of NK cell plasticity, promoting the acquisition of features associated with tissue residency and weakened effector functions, and could be relevant in pathophysiological contexts, highlighting IL-35 as an attractive target for future immunotherapies aimed at enhancing NK cell clinical activity.">

        <tr id="Aim The primary goal of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate role that VEGF plays in creating an immunologically tolerant milieu in cases of OSCC or oral squamous cell carcinoma. Examining how VEGF affects the behavior and functionality of dendritic cells (DCs). Through an examination of the interactions among VEGF, DCs, and the tumor microenvironment. Methods This study investigated the expression of the immunosuppressive markers IDO and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in DCs under the effect of VEGF employing real-time PCR (RT-PCR), flow cytometry and Western blot (WB). Additionally, mixed lymphocyte reactions and tumor cell cytotoxicity assays were conducted to assess functional changes in DCs. Results VEGF exposure led to an upregulation of IDO and PD-L1 in DCs, coupled with reduced T-cell proliferation and altered immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. In vivo studies using mice models further substantiated the role of VEGF in enhancing tumor immune tolerance. Conclusion Our findings elucidate the crucial role of VEGF in OSCC progression by modulating DC function, offering new insights into potential immunotherapeutic strategies targeting VEGF-mediated pathways.

        <tr id="Human papillomavirus-mediated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a premalignant neoplasia of the upper airway characterized by significant dysphonia and respiratory obstruction. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a potential alternative to repeated surgical interventions in RRP. Here, we investigated the intralesional T-cell composition and expression of the immune checkpoints programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in RRP. We analyzed tissue samples from 30 patients treated at a tertiary care center between 2009 and 2021, including paired samples from individual patients collected at different time points. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4, CD8, CTLA-4, FoxP3, and PD-L1 and correlated with disease severity and previous adjuvant therapies. Overall disease burden and intervention-free survival were not associated with the abundance of CD4+, CD8+, or FoxP3+ T cells, nor with immune checkpoint expression. However, patients with aggressive disease exhibited a higher intralesional FoxP3/CD4 T-cell ratio. Prior intralesional cidofovir treatment was associated with reduced CD4+ T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that a locally immunosuppressive microenvironment, reflected by an elevated FoxP3/CD4 ratio, contributes to disease severity in RRP. Consistent CTLA-4 expression across all evaluated samples supports further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, either alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the inability of lymphocytes to infiltrate the tumor nest, a phenomenon known as immune exclusion, drastically limits ICB responsiveness. Analyzing the immune landscape of matched pre- and early on-treatment biopsies of patients with melanoma undergoing ICB therapy, we observed a significant increase in cytotoxic NK cells in early on-treatment biopsies from nonresponders. Spatial multiomic analyses revealed that, although NK cells colocalized with CD8+ T cells within the tumor bed in responding lesions, they were excluded from the tumor parenchyma in nonresponding lesions. Strikingly, pharmacologic depletion of NK cells in a unique melanoma mouse model exhibiting an immune-excluded phenotype unleashed immune infiltration of the tumor core and tumor clearance upon ICB exposure. Mechanistically, we show that NK cells are actively recruited to immune-excluded areas upon ICB exposure via the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 to suppress tumor infiltration and antitumor function of CD8+ T cells.


SIGNIFICANCE
Immune exclusion is responsible for intrinsic resistance to ICB in about half of nonresponder patients. Our unexpected observation that targeting NK cell biology unleashes the recruitment and antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells in tumors with an immune-excluded phenotype offers a potential therapeutic avenue for this large patient population.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit a dual role in tumor progression and antitumor immunity. However, understanding the functional states and molecular mechanisms of antitumor TAMs remains a challenge. Herein, we show that intratumoral administration of a combination of agonists against TLR3 and CD40 (hereafter termed myeloid cell treatment, MCT) reprogrammed TAMs in situ to adopt a protective antitumor phenotype in an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model, and that this led to tumor regression. Single-cell RNA sequencing of TAMs from different tumor stages and post-MCT revealed a transient antitumor TAM phenotype, present at 12h post-MCT, characterized by markers such as iNOS and CD38, which was replaced by TAMs co-expressing tumor-limiting and promoting features by 72h post-MCT. Maintenance of antitumor TAMs required repeated MCT administration, and this promoted the activation of CD8+ T cells and long-term tumor eradication. Mechanistically, ROS and TNF-α were pivotal in TAM-mediated tumor control. Our findings uncover the vulnerability of transient TAM reprogramming and show that it can be overcome by repeated MCT administrations to sustain efficient antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Regulatory T cell (Treg)‐derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a contact‐independent mechanism by which Tregs suppress dysregulated immune responses. These EVs carry diverse immunomodulatory molecules, including CD73, an ectoenzyme that hydrolyses AMP into adenosine. Adenosine subsequently acts as a potent immunosuppressive mediator that inhibits effector CD4⁺ T cell activation and controls pathological inflammation. Periodontitis is a highly prevalent inflammatory disease characterised by the accumulation of IL‐17A‐expressing CD4⁺ T cells in response to dysbiotic oral bacterial biofilms, ultimately leading to RANKL‐mediated alveolar bone resorption and tooth loss. We tested the hypothesis that CD73⁺ Treg‐derived EVs, isolated from Tregs induced with polarising cytokines in the presence of retinoic acid, could limit inflammation and prevent alveolar bone loss in periodontitis. Our findings demonstrate that Tregs induced with polarising cytokines in the presence of retinoic acid express high levels of CD73 and secrete adenosine‐producing suppressive CD73+ EVs. Furthermore, local administration of these CD73⁺ Treg‐derived EVs in a murine periodontitis model reduced activated CD4⁺ T cell infiltration, decreased IL‐17A and RANKL expression, and attenuated osteoclast‐mediated alveolar bone loss. In conclusion, retinoic acid‐induced Treg‐derived EVs suppress CD4⁺ T cell‐driven inflammation and ameliorate periodontitis, at least in part through CD73/adenosine‐dependent immunomodulatory mechanisms.">

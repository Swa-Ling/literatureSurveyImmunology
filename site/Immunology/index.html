        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Background Metastatic lung carcinoma poses considerable treatment difficulties. It exhibits cellular characteristics that differ from those of early-stage cancer. Immunotherapy demonstrates enhanced hope for patients with advanced and metastatic lung cancer. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may be a contributing factor that diminishes the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)+ TAMs are considered to possess immunosuppressive characteristics, as their interaction with CD8+ T lymphocytes results in the exhaustion of these cells. Methods We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of lung cancer metastases in order to examine the development of brain metastatic tumors. Furthermore, the cell–cell interactions between SPP1+ TAM cells and CD8+ T cells within primary and brain metastatic cancers were systematically compared. Additionally, we utilized a flow cytometer and immunofluorescence to demonstrate how SPP1 affects the function of CD8+ T cells. In vitro, we generated SPP1-overexpressing macrophages and performed qPCR, Western blot, and co-culture assays with or without anti-SPP1 or anti-A2AR treatment to evaluate immunosuppressive effects. Results The results demonstrated that the proportions of immune cells in metastatic brain tissues are lower, while the infiltration of macrophages is higher. SPP1+ TAMs contribute to immune suppression in lung cancer by limiting the activation of CD8+ T cells and cytokine production. Anti-SPP1 treatment positively impacts CD8+ T cell function, counteracting SPP1-induced dysfunction and facilitating the production of cytokines. SPP1 overexpression in macrophages enhanced their immunosuppressive phenotype by upregulating CD73 and cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, leading to impaired CD8⁺ T cell function via A2AR signaling; notably, neutralization of SPP1 or A2AR successfully restored CD8⁺ T cell activity. Conclusions Our findings characterize the immunological environment of both primary and metastatic lung cancer, highlighting SPP1-mediated immune suppression as a potential therapeutic target to restore T cell responses. Preclinical data demonstrate that Anti-SPP1 antibodies can reverse T cell exhaustion and enhance immune responses in lung cancer.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) orchestrates a profound disruption of immune balance within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. To better understand these complex immune dynamics, we used high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling to comprehensively characterize the immune landscape of the BM across different stages of myeloma progression, including MGUS (n = 16), smoldering MM (SMM; n = 25), and active MM, both newly diagnosed (n = 43) and relapsed/refractory (n = 104). Our analysis revealed substantial immune remodeling during disease progression, characterized by adaptive immune suppression and extensive infiltration of innate immune populations. Transformation from MGUS to SMM was marked by significant alterations in central and effector memory T helper cells, effector cytotoxic T cells, and an enrichment of monocytic and neutrophil subsets. Active MM stages were further distinguished by increased expansion of myeloid and monocytic lineages, alongside a pronounced reduction in progenitor and transitional B cells. Correspondence analysis demonstrated that specific immune profiles were significantly associated with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall survival. This study highlights the potential of CyTOF-based molecular profiling to unravel the intricate immune dynamics of the BM microenvironment across MM disease stages, enhancing our understanding of MM pathogenesis and providing a foundation for identifying prognostic biomarkers and tailoring precision immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils have emerged as key players in tumor progression and are often associated with poor prognosis. Despite ongoing efforts to target neutrophil functions in cancer, therapeutic success has been limited. In this study, we addressed the possibility of blocking STAT3 signaling in neutrophils as a targeted therapeutic intervention in cancer. Conditional deletion of Stat3 in a neutrophil-specific manner (Ly6GcreStat3fl/fl mice) significantly impaired tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Neutrophils isolated from these mice exhibited a strong antitumoral phenotype, with increased MHCII, CD80/86 and ICAM-1 expression. Immune profiling of tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of these mice revealed significant enrichment of CD8+ T cells (granzymeBhi, perforinhi and IFN-γhi) with strong cytotoxic activity. To further translate these findings to human settings, we blocked STAT3 signaling in cancer patient neutrophils via the small molecule inhibitor LLL12 and assessed its effects on patient-derived tumor explants. In agreement with the in vivo mouse data, we observed the expansion and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in such explants. To test the therapeutic applicability of STAT3 targeting, we utilized myeloid cell-selective STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide (CpG-STAT3ASO) to target neutrophils in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with previous results, neutrophil-specific STAT3 knockdown impaired tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxic T cell activity in the tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of treated mice. These findings highlight STAT3 signaling as a deleterious pathway supporting the protumoral activity of neutrophils and suggest that neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition is a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy, providing novel insights into targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Introduction A comprehensive characterization of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is essential to advance understanding of tumor biology and guide immunotherapy development. Methods Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed 14,441 immune cells isolated from tumor tissues and paratumor tissues of three CSCC patients. By integrating data on tumor suppressors, oncogenic factors, cytokines, and chemokines, we performed differential gene expression analyses across immune populations. Results This analysis identified nine major immune cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer/T cells (NK/T cells), B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and macrophages. Notably, elevated CCR7 expression in exhausted CD8+ T cells was associated with improved prognosis, suggesting it as a preliminary candidate for an immunoregulatory target that warrants further investigation. Additionally, CCL5 levels were elevated in Tregs, indicating a possible involvement in their recruitment to the tumor site that requires further validation. Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis identified candidate genes for further mechanistic investigation. Discussion This systematic comparison of the TME between tumor and paratumor tissues reveals dynamic changes in the immune landscape, providing insights and suggesting potential targets for further study to enhance understanding and treatment of CSCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with limited treatment options. Macrophage phagocytosis is a complex, tightly regulated process governed by competing pro-phagocytic and anti-phagocytic signals. CD47-SIRPα signaling inhibits macrophage activity, while radiotherapy (RT) can enhance tumor immunogenicity. How RT and CD47 blockade together modulate macrophage “appetite” and activation states remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of glioma immune evasion and therapy resistance. Methods Human and mouse glioma cell lines were exposed to fractionated RT, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, or both. Flow cytometry and ELISA quantified the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and expression of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In vitro, phagocytosis assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze transcriptional changes in macrophage subsets that phagocytosed (“eaters”) or did not phagocytose (“non-eaters”) glioma cells. In vivo, efficacy of combination therapy was assessed using orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of DMG and GBM. Results RT induced ICD in glioma cells, evidenced by dose-dependent increases in DAMPs such as phosphatidylserine, calreticulin, HSP70/90, and HMGB1. RT and anti-CD47 each promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, with a synergistic effect observed when combined. scRNA-seq of phagocytic macrophages revealed transcriptionally distinct subpopulations associated with each treatment, characterized by enrichment in inflammatory, metabolic, and antigen presentation pathways. In vivo, combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden, extended survival, and polarized tumor-associated macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. Distinct macrophage markers (CLEC7A, CD44, CD63) validated scRNA-seq findings in vivo. Conclusions This study highlights that macrophage fate is intimately linked to the molecular properties of what they phagocytose. Phagocytosis is not a singular, uniform process but a dynamic and context-dependent event that drives macrophage specialization and plasticity. By demonstrating that RT and anti-CD47 therapy shape distinct macrophage phenotypes through their effects on tumor immunogenicity, this study provides a framework for understanding how to harness and reprogram macrophage activity for therapeutic benefit. These findings underscore the potential of targeting macrophage plasticity as a strategy to enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes in malignant gliomas and other diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background While highly efficacious for numerous cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause unpredictable and potentially severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), underscoring the need to understand irAE biology. Methods We used a multidimensional approach incorporating single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiling to characterize the peripheral immune landscape of patients receiving ICI therapy according to irAE development. Results Analysis of 162 patients revealed that individuals who developed clinically significant irAEs exhibited a baseline proinflammatory, autoimmune-like state characterized by a significantly higher abundance of CD57+ T and natural killer (NK) T cells, plasmablasts, proliferating and activated CXCR3+ lymphocytes, CD8+ effector and terminal effector memory T cells, along with reduced NK cells and elevated plasma ANA levels. In irAE cases, we identified distinct baseline proinflammatory gene signatures, including markedly higher expression of IL1B and CXCL8 in monocytes and CXCR3, TNF, and IFNG in T/NK cells. TNF signaling was the most enriched pathway, while immunosuppressive genes SIGLEC7 and CXCR4 were downregulated. Following ICI initiation, these patients exhibited an enhanced shift toward an activated and inflammatory immune phenotype, including monocyte reprogramming characterized by upregulation of IL18 and elevated gene expression levels of CXCL10. Conversely, post-treatment levels of CXCL8 were decreased in irAE patients. Notably, in patients who did not develop clinically significant irAE, we identified increased baseline abundance of a TGFBIhigh myeloid cluster enriched in immunosuppressive markers such as STAB1. In addition, patients without irAE exhibited upregulation of TNF and AIRE, accompanied by distinct myeloid protumorigenic reprogramming. Conclusions A pre-existing activated, autoimmune-like proinflammatory state drives the development of irAE during ICI therapy through three key axes: increased plasmablast/ANA, heightened interferon-gamma/CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, and amplified TNF signaling. These findings may serve as potential peripheral immune biomarkers for predicting irAE and provide biological insights into the mechanisms governing and mitigating irAE.">

        <tr id="Comprehensive characterization of bovine immune cell populations is essential for improving animal welfare and disease resilience. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 29,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Angus cattle stratified by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a proxy for the cellular immune response (Cell-IR). Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity. Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat highlighted pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, particularly the IL-1β– IL-1R1 ligand-receptor interactions. This study provides a high-resolution atlas of Angus PBMCs and establishes a framework for linking immune cell composition with functional immune phenotypes in cattle.

        <tr id="CD8+ T play essential roles in antitumor immune responses. However, immunotherapy has limited clinical efficacy in many solid tumors. Here, we performed an epigenetic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in CD8+ T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy setting and found that Prdm12 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in nociceptive neuron development but uncharacterized within immunological contexts. Prdm12 deletion markedly enhanced in vivo tumor clearance of mouse CD8+ T cells and promoted activation, effector differentiation marker expression, and cytokine secretion in both murine and human CD8+ T cells in vitro. Mechanistically, Prdm12 deficiency augmented effector transcriptional programs while inhibiting exhaustion of CGRP-RAMP1 neuroimmune axis facilitation. Additionally, Prdm12 ablation remodeled the chromatin accessibility landscape, with H3K9me3 deposition at loci regulating T cell differentiation (Trib1 and Sgk1) and exhaustion (Rgs1 and Nr4a2). These results together reveal a negative regulatory mechanism for CD8+ T cells and advance our understanding of cancer immunotherapy by linking neurobiological signaling to immune regulation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite advancements in immunotherapies, the diversity of the tumor microenvironment remains a challenge for cancer treatment. To elucidate microenvironment‐specific differences in antitumor responses, we established patient‐derived ex vivo tumor‐lung slices. We analyzed immune activation profiles after treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 and the checkpoint inhibitor Nivolumab. Lung slices from non‐tumor, tumor‐adjacent, tumor‐border, and tumor‐central tissue were generated and assessed for viability, cell composition, and immune competence via flow cytometry, soluble factor secretion, and bulk RNA‐sequencing. The tumor‐border contained the highest number of immune cells (8.3‐fold vs. non‐tumor), secreted tumor markers (S100 and CA15‐3), and exhibited high levels of inflammatory mediators (IFNγ, IL‐6, and IL‐2). Treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 increased the frequency of CD137+/CD8+ T cells and induced cytokine responses dominated by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Granzyme B. While both non‐tumor and tumor‐border tissue responded to anti‐CD3/CD28, the intensities of immune responses were highly varied. Notably, treatment with Nivolumab induced an inflammatory response primarily in the tumor‐border evidenced by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Perforin secretion alongside increased expression of CD107a on CD8+ T cells, in a donor‐dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate how tumor‐border tissue slices can be utilized to study T cell responses in the context of the patient‐specific tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is one of the most widespread immunosuppressive viruses, impairing the protective efficacy of vaccines in pig herds. Previous studies have shown that PCV2 infection reduces the generation of immune memory and antibody secretion induced by vaccination in hosts. In this study, we used single-cell mRNA sequencing of mice splenic cells to show that PCV2 infection decelerates the differentiation of light zone germinal center (GC) B cells into memory B cells and plasma cells. We found that, although PCV2 infection led to lymphocyte depletion in the spleens of mice, the remaining splenic B cells were activated by the infection. The percentage of naïve B cells in PCV2-infected mice decreased mainly due to differentiation rather than death. Meanwhile, the percentages of memory B cells and plasma cells increased without significant enhancement of functional gene expression. Focusing on the GC B cells, we found that PCV2 infection activated the proliferation of dark zone GC B cells, but not the differentiation of light zone GC B cells. Furthermore, the transcriptional level of Prdm1 was not significantly altered by PCV2 infection, and the level of Bach2 was dramatically reduced. Further analysis showed that the interactions between light zone GC B cells and dendritic cells, macrophages, and follicular helper T cells were weakened in the spleens of PCV2-infected mice. In conclusion, this study found that PCV2 infection impairs the differentiation of B cells into functional memory B cells and plasma cells. This may be an important and previously unrecognized reason why PCV2 infection impairs vaccine efficiency.">

        <tr id="Sweet syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory skin disorder characterized by erythematous plaques with a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. First-line therapy remains oral corticosteroids, which suppresses inflammation non-specifically. Although neutrophils are typically short-lived, how they persist in Sweet syndrome skin and contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized population of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like neutrophils expressing MHC class II genes that are uniquely present in Sweet syndrome skin but absent from healthy tissue and circulation. Keratinocytes extended neutrophil lifespan 10-fold in co-culture experiments and drove the emergence of an APC-like phenotype in approximately 30% of neutrophils, mirroring observations in patient lesions. Mechanistically, keratinocyte-derived serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) signals through the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on neutrophils to promote their survival. These long-lived neutrophils actively orchestrate local immune responses by recruiting T cells and inducing cytokine production. Strikingly, dual blockade of SAA1-FPR2 signaling restores neutrophil turnover to baseline levels, with efficacy comparable to high-dose corticosteroids. These findings uncover a keratinocyte-neutrophil-T cell axis that sustains chronic inflammation in Sweet syndrome and highlight the SAA1/FPR2 pathway as a promising target for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with favorable prognosis and positive response to immunotherapy in cancer. Here we show that simultaneous activation of innate immune effectors, STING and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR), results in CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor suppression while inducing high endothelial venule development and germinal center-like B cell responses in tumors to generate functional TLS in a T cell-dependent manner. In a neoadjuvant setting, activation of STING and LTβR by their agonists effectively immunized mice against tumor recurrence, leading to long-term survival. STING activation alone was insufficient for inducing B cell-containing TLS or eliciting long-term therapeutic effects. However, when combined with LTβR activation, it improved the fitness of TLS with B cell expansion and maturation to IgG-producing long-lived plasma cells and memory cells, increased CD4+ T cell recruitment and memory CD8+ T cell expansion, and shifted the TH2/TH17 balance, resulting in the potentiation of humoral and cellular immunity against tumors. These findings suggest a therapeutic approach of simultaneously activating STING and lymphotoxin pathways.">

        <tr id="The draining lymph node (LN) is the most frequent and often first site of cancer metastasis. Although endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is frequently performed as a standard practice in lung cancer diagnosis and staging, its diagnostic accuracy remains modest, primarily due to the minuscule sample size of needle aspirates. With the advent of single-cell technologies, we comprehensively analyzed the immune cell repertoire in a series of EBUS-TBNA samples. Intrathoracic LN samples from 18 subjects with pathologically confirmed metastasis and four controls without evidence of metastasis were compared using single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry analyses. We found that immune cell composition and gene expression patterns differed markedly between metastatic and control LNs. In particular, metastatic LNs contained relatively more APOE-high myeloid cells, with the latter exhibiting significant transcriptional derangement and a powerful intercellular interaction signature. Additionally, CD8 T cells in metastatic LNs demonstrated a unique exhausted phenotype. In conclusion, immune cell phenotypes and gene expression patterns from EBUS-TBNA samples can be leveraged to advance our understanding of cancer immunology and may have independent diagnostic value when malignant cells fail to be identified on histopathology.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by dense stroma and myeloid-rich microenvironment that confer resistance to immunotherapies. Previous studies demonstrated that disrupting the immune-stroma CXCR4-CXCL12 axis facilitates T cell recruitment and mobility to collaborate with anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. We sought to test the clinical viability of this immunotherapeutic strategy. 21 patients with metastatic PDAC were enrolled and treated in a phase 2 trial evaluating the effects of the plerixafor/AMD3100 and cemiplimab. Primary endpoint was objective response rate. Blood and tissue biospecimens were collected for correlative analyses. Parallel mouse studies were used to determine potential mechanisms of resistance. Treatments were well-tolerated, but only two patients demonstrated a best response of stable disease. Correlative analyses confirmed significant mobilization of immune cells into circulation as well as increased immune infiltration into the tumor. High-parameter imaging revealed higher levels of CD8+ T cells but also granulocytes and macrophages upon treatment. Spatial analysis showed that treatment resulted in closer proximity between macrophages and T cells but not between granulocytes and T cells. Mouse studies revealed that whereas total granulocyte depletion had no effect on immunotherapeutic efficacy, macrophage-targeting yielded significant benefit. Tumor growth measurements and immune profiling of immunotherapeutic combinations incorporating macrophage-targeting showed that despite the increased T cell infiltration, CXCR4 antagonism was in fact associated with enrichment of CD206hiIA/IElo macrophage subtypes and modestly dampened efficacy. Our findings validate the utility of CXCR4 antagonism as an effective immune-recruiting platform but also underscores the need for strategies that better leverage its effects.">

        <tr id="Background Halo nevi are clinically common and are characterized by a circle of leukoderma around the central melanocytic nevus. Studies have shown that the pathogenesis of halo nevi is similar to that of vitiligo and is associated with the role of CD8⁺ T lymphocytes in melanocyte destruction. Histopathological findings have revealed neutrophil infiltration in halo nevi; however, the specific immune mechanisms involving neutrophils have not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, we investigated the role of neutrophils in halo nevi using histopathological and immunological analyses. Methods To this end, we examined the infiltration patterns of immune cells in halo nevi, with a particular focus on IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression in neutrophils and its potential immunoregulatory effects. Results The results demonstrated that IFN-γ expression in the lesional skin of halo nevi contributed to the induction of PD-L1 expression in neutrophils. PD-L1⁺ neutrophils promoted apoptosis and suppressed the function of CD8⁺ T lymphocytes. Notably, some halo nevi showed a tendency to spontaneous regression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and this regulatory mechanism influences the local immune response and may facilitate the repigmentation of the surrounding leukoderma in halo nevi. Conclusions This study is the first to explore the involvement of neutrophils in halo nevi and reveal the potential immunoregulatory role of PD-L1 in this process. The elucidation of this mechanism not only provides a more comprehensive understanding of autoimmune skin diseases but may also offer new strategies for targeted therapy in other related disorders, such as vitiligo.">

        <tr id="The immune ecosystem is central to maintaining effective defensive responses. However, it remains largely understudied how immune cells in the peripheral blood interact with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastasis. Here, blood analysis of patients with advanced breast cancer revealed that over 75% of CTC-positive blood specimens contained heterotypic CTC clusters with CD45+ white blood cells (WBCs), which correlates with breast cancer subtypes, racial groups, and decreased survival. CTC-WBC clusters included overrepresented T cells and underrepresented neutrophils. Specifically, a rare subset of CD4 and CD8 double-positive T (DPT) cells was 140-fold enriched in CTC clusters versus their frequency in WBCs. DPT cells shared properties with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but exhibited unique features of T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. Mechanistically, the integrin heterodimer α4β1, also named very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), in DPT cells and its ligand, VCAM1, in tumor cells are essential mediators of DPT-CTC clusters. Neoadjuvant administration of anti-VLA-4 neutralizing antibodies markedly blocked CTC–DPT clusters, inhibited metastasis, and extended mouse survival. These findings highlight a pivotal role of rare DPT cells in fostering cancer dissemination through CTC clustering. It lays a foundation for developing innovative biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies to prevent and target cancer metastasis.">

        <tr id="The infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is critical for the establishment of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), yet no approved therapies specifically block it. Here, we employed a gene signature-based drug screening approach to identify potential agents for reversing MDSC-mediated immunosuppression in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Transcriptomic analysis of 73,326 tumor samples and 190,588 single cells revealed C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1) and CXCL2 as the key gene signature of MDSC infiltration. Combining this gene signature with high-throughput sequencing-based high-throughput screening (HTS2), we identified ponatinib as a potential inhibitor of MDSC infiltration. By employing multiple preclinical models, we demonstrated that ponatinib blocks MDSC infiltration and reverses the immunosuppressive TME, thus inhibiting TNBC growth in a TME-dependent manner, and significantly enhances anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy efficacy. Mechanistically, ponatinib directly inhibits p38α kinase activity, reducing signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation at Ser727 and suppressing CXCL1 and CXCL2 expression in cancer cells, thereby blocking MDSC infiltration. Our findings establish ponatinib as a novel inhibitor of MDSC-mediated immunosuppressive TME and underscore its therapeutic potential in combination with immune checkpoint blockade for TNBC treatment.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary TB that develops in immunocompetent adult humans is responsible for approximately 85% of the disease burden and is central for Mtb transmission. Most humans contain Mtb infection within primary granulomatous lesions, but in certain immunocompetent humans, containment fails, leading to hematogenous spread and active pulmonary disease with the formation of cavities that enable Mtb transmission via aerosols. To reveal lung-specific microenvironments conducive for Mtb survival and replication despite systemic immunity, we use fluorescence multiplex immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomic analyses of heterogenous TB lesions that uniquely form in the lungs of immunocompetent but TB-susceptible B6.Sst1S mice after hematogenous spread from the primary lesion. Initially, these secondary lung lesions manifested local adoptive immunity featuring tertiary lymphoid follicles similar to resistant B6 mice and contained primarily non- replicating bacilli. Following these early events, however, the B6.Sst1S mice uniquely demonstrate expansion of myeloid cell populations with the appearance of alternatively activated macrophages, dissolution of lymphoid follicles, and the accumulation of de- differentiated lung epithelial cells. These processes led to bronchogenic expansion, broncho- occlusion, and necrosuppurative pneumonia closely resembling advanced pulmonary tuberculosis in humans. To determine whether lung parenchymal cells or lung oxygenation were necessary for the pulmonary TB progression, we implanted lung and spleen fragments subcutaneously prior to the infection. The lung implants uniquely displayed the formation of the characteristic organized granulomas with necrosis and Mtb replication that paralleled TB progression in native lungs, demonstrating that the cellular composition of inflamed lung tissue, not oxygenation, is a critical determinant of pulmonary TB progression. Our data demonstrate that deleterious bi-directional interactions of aberrantly activated macrophages with the inflammation-injured lung resident cells determine lung vulnerability to virulent Mtb in immunocompetent hosts. Because these mechanisms enable Mtb transmission among humans via aerosols, they are likely evolutionary conserved and, therefore, represent appealing targets for host-directed TB therapies.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial part of the innate immune system and serve as an important effector for killing tumor cells through direct cytolytic activity or immunomodulatory signaling to T cells and antigen presenting cells. NK cells are correlated with increased tumor control and better overall patient survival across various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite their promising potential for anti-tumor killing, NK cell function is often diminished within the tumor microenvironment. There are many factors that lead to decreased tumor-infiltrating NK cell killing, including immunoinhibitory factors from tumor cells and resident tissues, acquired immune tolerance, NK cell exhaustion, and the hypoxic state of the tumor microenvironment. Unleashing NK cell activity therefore has high potential to create a new class of immunotherapy that could combat both primary and acquired resistance to current checkpoint inhibitors. In this review we discuss mechanistic details of NK cell tumor killing, NK cell immunosuppression, and gaps in knowledge regarding highly complex microenvironment-specific effects on NK cell function. We also discuss the promise and limitations of emerging NK-cell based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Since their discovery, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as key players in immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. Early research focused on defining ILC subsets, including ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, by distinguishing their development, transcriptional profiles, and effector functions relative to T cells. Subsequent studies characterized the tissue-resident nature of ILCs and mapped their context-dependent phenotypes across diverse organs. In parallel, increasing evidence linked ILC subset imbalances to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and various cancers. Recent work has leveraged circulating ILC frequencies and phenotypes as potential biomarkers for disease severity and progression. Notably, the immunomodulatory, tissue-reparative, and cytotoxic functions of helper ILCs have attracted interest as novel therapeutic avenues. Current strategies to harness ILCs for therapy include ex vivo expansion of autologous or allogeneic ILCs, derivation of ILC-like cells from umbilical cord blood or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), and engineering of ILCs with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to enhance antigen specificity. Additionally, cytokine modulation and immune checkpoint blockade are being explored to sustain or redirect ILC function in disease contexts. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the functional diversity, plasticity, and tissue residency of ILC subsets, emphasizing their interactions with other immune and stromal cells, and their roles as predictive, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases and cancers. Key translational challenges, including subset heterogeneity, plasticity, tissue-restricted residency, and limited scalability, remain barriers to clinical application. However, emerging multi-omic technologies, single-cell atlases, and synthetic biology approaches are accelerating efforts to map ILC states with unprecedented resolution and guide rational therapeutic design. Looking forward, integration of ILC-based therapies with regenerative medicine, cellular engineering, and immuno-oncology platforms holds promise for developing next-generation precision immunotherapies. By bridging fundamental biology with translational innovation, this field is poised to expand the therapeutic landscape for both autoimmune and malignant diseases.">

Using whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and DNA methylation profiling, we assessed HDM effects in lung epithelial cell lines and a mouse orthotopic lung cancer model. HDM accelerated tumor growth without altering mutational burden. Transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed tissue-specific effects: in normal lung, HDM enhanced pro-inflammatory and immune activation programs, whereas in tumors it suppressed T cell responses, antigen presentation, and chemokine signaling. Immune deconvolution showed a shift toward myeloid enrichment and lymphoid suppression, with reduced cytotoxic T and NK signatures. Notably, HDM-driven tumor promotion was abolished in Il17a−/− but not Il1b−/− mice, identifying IL-17A as a critical mediator. These findings demonstrate that chronic aeroallergen exposure reshapes the lung microenvironment to promote immune suppression and accelerate lung cancer progression.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have traditionally been understood to exert their effects primarily within the tumor microenvironment, particularly targeting CD8 + T cells. However, recent studies have highlighted a pivotal role of tumor-draining lymph nodes in mediating responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study aimed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which tumor-draining lymph nodes respond to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and regulate the tumor microenvironment in human colorectal cancer. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing on tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumor tissues from patients with colorectal cancer. Through in-depth analysis of the single-cell data, we established the connection between TDLNs and tumor, and explored the impact of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy on the immune microenvironment of tumor-draining lymph nodes. In addition, we conducted animal experiments to validate these findings. Results Our findings revealed that immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment induced the expansion of tumor-specific CD8 + effector memory T cells within tumor-draining lymph nodes, which may serve as a source for the progenitor-exhausted CD8 + T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, conventional dendritic cells type 1 and macrophages within tumor-draining lymph nodes facilitated this process. We also observed that immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy promoted the expansion of tumor-specific CD4 + follicular helper T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which may explain the increase of CD4 + follicular helper T cells in the tumor microenvironment after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. These hypotheses were corroborated through experiments in mice. Conclusions Our findings delineate the critical regulatory function of tumor-draining lymph nodes in modulating the tumor microenvironment during Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

        <tr id="Retinoic acid (RA) plays a key role in mucosal immune regulation and tolerance, with implications for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, its effects have not been extensively studied in humanized in vitro models that recapitulate epithelial–immune interactions. We established a 3D in vitro small intestinal model composed of three epithelial cell types, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocyte/dendritic cell (M/DC) precursors derived from CD34+ umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The epithelial microenvironment strongly suppressed monocyte/DC differentiation and T cell activation, indicating a regulatory role of epithelial-derived signals. Retinoic acid (RA) priming of M/DC precursors induced CD103+CD11b+Sirp1α− regulatory DCs and promoted a shift from naive to memory-type T cells. Upon addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β), the model mimicked an inflamed intestinal state, resulting in CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes and increased T cell activation (CD25+CD69+). RA-primed DCs modestly counterbalanced T cell activation and IBD-like responses, even under inflammatory conditions. Flow cytometry and clustering analysis revealed distinct immune cell phenotypes depending on RA exposure and cytokine context. This model provides a reproducible and physiologically relevant human system to study RA-mediated immune programming in the intestinal mucosa and may support the development of novel therapeutic strategies for IBD and related inflammatory conditions. Statistical differences were evaluated using ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test (n = 4; p < 0.05).">

        <tr id="Background Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive hematologic malignancy, with the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype displaying particularly poor prognosis due to inherent treatment resistance and elevated recurrence rates. Despite advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, a significant proportion of patients experience relapse or refractory disease, highlighting the urgent need for novel biomarkers and innovative therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes. Methods A multi-dimensional analysis of SH3BP5 expression was performed across DLBCL subtypes, integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical datasets to assess its correlation with immune infiltration, tumor metabolism, and patient prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing data were employed to examine the tumor microenvironment (TME) with higher resolution. Further analysis of the association between SH3BP5 and immune checkpoint gene expression was conducted to explore its potential role in immunotherapy response. Functional in vitro assays were carried out to assess the impact of SH3BP5 knockdown on DLBCL cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results The analysis revealed that SH3BP5 is preferentially overexpressed in the ABC subtype of DLBCL across multiple datasets and validated cohorts, and its high expression is significantly associated with poor overall survival. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that SH3BP5 is mainly expressed in malignant B cells and inversely correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly CD8 + T cells. Mechanistically, pathway enrichment and metabolic assays indicated that SH3BP5 is linked to mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and potentially contributing to reduced responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Functional studies showed that SH3BP5 knockdown significantly suppressed DLBCL cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced tumor cell viability in vitro. Conclusion This study suggests that SH3BP5 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in DLBCL, particularly within the ABC subtype. By delineating its associations with immune evasion and metabolic reprogramming, these findings provide a mechanistic basis for further exploration of SH3BP5-targeted interventions to help overcome therapy resistance. Future studies in larger clinical cohorts and functional models are warranted to validate these results and assess the potential of integrating SH3BP5 expression profiling into precision medicine strategies for DLBCL.

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid cells are a diverse group of immune cell types with systemic and organ-specific functions. Myeloid cells are frequently found in the tumor microenvironment and their infiltration correlates with survival and response to treatment. High myeloid infiltration is typically a poor prognostic factor, and the immune suppressive and prometastatic roles of myeloid cells are well established. However, there is an increasing appreciation of the antitumor functions performed by myeloid cells, which include direct tumor cell killing, phagocytosis, antigen presentation and T and natural killer cell recruitment. Moreover, advances in immune phenotyping have uncovered myeloid subsets with positive prognostic significance, including subsets correlating with higher response rates to immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent progress in mapping and dissecting the opposing effects of myeloid cells on cancer progression and immunotherapy response. The overall impact of myeloid cells is context-dependent, and combination therapies are needed to leverage the antitumor potential of these cells.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in anti-tumor immunity by capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells, making DC-based immunotherapy a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, the most commonly used clinical strategy still relies on inducing DCs in vitro using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL - 4) (GM/IL4-DCs), which often results in a heterogeneous cell population with suboptimal anti-tumor function. Here, we compared DCs generated by co-stimulating with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) and GM-CSF (FL/GM-DCs) with the conventional GM/IL4-DCs. Method To compare the functional differences of DCs induced by different methods, we conducted a comprehensive study. Mouse bone marrow cells were continuously cultured for 9 days in a FLT3L/GM-CSF-containing medium. After cell collection, we analyzed the composition, subpopulations, and status of FL/GM-DCs using flow cytometry and scRNA-seq. Flow cytometry was also used to assess their antigen presentation and ability to stimulate T cells. In vivo experiments were performed to examine their distribution, anti-tumor effects, and therapeutic responses in tumor models. Finally, combining scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq, we explored the mechanisms by which FL/GM-DCs reshape the tumor microenvironment. Results The results showed that FL/GM-DCs exhibited a unique subpopulation distribution, characterized by an abundance of conventional cDC subpopulations, and demonstrated enhanced cross-antigen presentation capabilities. Notably, FL/GM-DCs were able to induce a broader and more tumor-specific CD8+ T cell response, effectively reshaping the tumor microenvironment by promoting the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and reducing immunosuppressive components. In contrast, GM/IL4-DCs contained fewer cDC subpopulations, eliciting a weaker initial CD8+ T cell response and yielding relatively inferior anti-tumor effects. Conclusion In summary, FLT3L combined with GM-CSF induced DCs, through their unique subpopulation composition and functional state, can more effectively expand tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and reshape the tumor microenvironment, thereby achieving superior immunotherapy outcomes. This study highlights the potential of FL/GM-DCs as a next-generation DC platform, paving the way for improved clinical translation of DC-based adoptive cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapies that induce immunogenic cell death such as necroptosis can arm the immune system to clear residual tumor cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling can trigger necroptosis, orchestrating immune responses to solid tumors. Whether RIPK3 activity can be exploited for controlling B cell malignancies remains unclear. Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition. Exploiting these findings, we showed that a combination therapy activating RIPK3 with SMAC mimetics while suppressing caspase activity and providing type I IFN resulted in immune-mediated control of B cell tumors. Hence, reprogramming RIPK3 activity represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity to target B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Although checkpoint immunotherapy has primarily focused on CD8⁺ T cells, emerging evidence highlights an important role for cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in mediating therapeutic responses. However, research on the functional properties of cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in the context of immunotherapy is still at an early stage and remains insufficiently defined. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from metastatic melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, we performed transcriptomic profiling of conventional CD4⁺ T cells, excluding proliferative and regulatory (FOXP3⁺) subsets, and compared responders and non-responders as distinct groups. Importantly, our analysis identified distinct clusters that discriminate between responders and non-responders, with cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells occupying a central position within these clusters. In responder-specific clusters, cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells exhibited features of early activation, whereas clusters specific to non-responders were characterized by an exhausted phenotype. Notably, non-responder-specific clusters were positioned proximally to Treg-like clusters, suggesting a potential transition from cytotoxic to regulatory CD4⁺ T cell states in non-responders. Our findings reinforce the emerging concept that cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells play a central role in mediating immunotherapy responses. These results provide a foundation for the development of predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating CD4⁺ T cell differentiation.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Humoral immune responses are critical for protection against immune challenge by pathogens and transformed cells, while dysregulated antibody production is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are central to the development of humoral immunity, regulating B‐cell maturation, including immunoglobulin class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, and development of memory B and antibody‐producing plasma cells. These events occur as B cells migrate to and differentiate within B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, with this classical program of follicular B cell maturation providing systemic immune protection. Local humoral responses are also necessary for organismal defense against immune challenge. Accordingly, T‐dependent B‐cell help occurs outside of B‐cell follicles, including in non‐lymphoid tissues such as the lung, central nervous system, joints, and kidneys. The phenotype and function of T cells that provide humoral protection against pathogens and tumors and conversely promote autoimmunity at the tissue level both overlap with and are distinct from those of canonical Tfh cells. Here, we summarize current knowledge of these tissue T‐B helper cells, focusing on their differentiation and function in infection, cancer, and autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="Background and objective Tumor antigen–escape variants undermine immunotherapy by subverting lymphocyte effector functions and reshaping tumor–immune dynamics. It is essential to delineate functional interplay within immune networks during tumor progression. We investigated whether homeostatic crosstalk between CD8+T cells and natural killer (NK) cells preempts tumor antigen–escape. Methods Adoptive CD8+T cell transfers were administered before (D–7, homeostatic pre-priming) or after (D+1) tumor establishment in Rag1−/− and Rag1−/−γc−/− mice. Antigen presentation, immune activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory were quantified by flow cytometry, live bioluminescence and confocal imaging. Monoculture, co-culture, and a 3D silica nanofiber carpet mimicking basement-membrane-like topography modeled intercellular interactions. Signaling arrays and motion metrics (Speed-Distance Index, deceleration) were conducted. Human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK crosstalk were probed in silico. Results and discussion Pre-tumor D–7 CD8+T cell transfer completely suppressed antigen–escape tumors with NK cells as major effectors showing elevated CD25, CD69, CD107a, and GzmB, marking activated and effector phenotype, and promoting central-memory CD62L⁺CD44⁺CD8⁺TCM precursors. By contrast, post-tumor D+1–transferred CD8+T cells allowed emergence of tumor variants resistant to antigen-specific cytolysis as assessed on day 25, despite those T cells retaining higher intrinsic cytotoxic capacity than the D–7 T cell cohort. Mechanistically, CD8+T and NK cells formed stable contacts through pseudopodial intercellular nanotubes enabling bidirectional membrane exchange and signaling via STAT, Akt, and mTOR pathways, augmenting NK effector function and promoting CD8+TCM differentiation. In silico analysis identified human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK adhesion, stimulatory and regulatory axes, including CD200–CD200R, PD-L1–PD-1, and CD18/CD11a–DNAM-1 (CD226). Together, data support a three-phase model of preemptive immunosurveillance initiated by early CD8⁺T–NK crosstalk. Conclusion Homeostatic conditioning and effector cooperativity between CD8+T and NK cells protect against tumor immune escape. The findings uncover a mechanistic axis of preemptive immunosurveillance that lays the foundation for next-generation preventive immunotherapies to control antigen–escape tumors.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The sustained effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) treatment is limited to a subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, highlighting the need to identify targetable biomarkers that synergize with PD1 blockade. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in HCC progression, along with growing evidence indicating its complex immunomodulatory effects within the tumor microenvironment. However, the interplay between cholesterol homeostasis and immune evasion remains elusive. Methods Transcriptomic and clinical data from HCC datasets were analyzed to identify cholesterol metabolism-related targets. Multiplex immunostaining and flow cytometry were applied to examine the immune landscape association with squalene epoxidase (SQLE) in human and murine tumors. Mechanistic studies were conducted in vitro, and co-culture experiments of tumor cells and T cells were followed by metabolomics and transcriptome analyses. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in mouse HCC models. Results We demonstrated that elevated SQLE expression in human HCC was associated with poor clinical outcomes and correlated with reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of SQLE in tumor cells promoted CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation in co-culture experiments. Untargeted metabolomics identified 27-hydrocholesterol, an oxysterol derived from tumor cells, as a key factor impairing CD8+ T cell function via cholesterol dysregulation. SQLE inhibition in tumor cells suppressed oxysterols secretion, therefore overcoming cholesterol restrictions and enhancing the immune responses of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, SQLE targeting with terbinafine restored antitumor immunity and synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in HCC. Conclusion Targeting tumorous SQLE restores CD8+ T cell function by overcoming cholesterol restrictions via oxysterol-SREBP2 signaling, highlighting SQLE as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Background The immune-balancing role of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) is well-recognized in contexts of immune dysregulation. Within the anti-tumor context, Tα1 demonstrated to act as an immune-enhancer, with potential roles in immunotherapy-based treatments. However, Tα1 immunomodulatory potential on tumor cells is poorly understood. Additionally, Tα1 pleiotropic effects on immune cells require in-depth investigations to unravel its specific impact on different immune cell populations. Thus, we first aimed to investigate whether Tα1 treatments influenced the transcriptional immune profile of various cancer cell lines. Alongside, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B, and natural killer cells from healthy donors (HDs) were treated individually with Tα1, to assess its direct effects on each immune cell population. Methods Cutaneous melanoma, glioblastoma, and pleural mesothelioma cell lines and HD immune cell subsets were treated with Tα1 for 48 hours. Total RNA was subsequently isolated, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by the nCounter® SPRINT Profiler. Genes with a log2ratio ≥0.58 and ≤−0.58 in Tα1-treated vs untreated cells were defined as differentially expressed (DEGs) and subsequently evaluated for the enrichment of Gene Ontology terms to identify biological processes potentially affected by Tα1 in tumor and immune cells. Results Tα1 minimally changed cancer cell DEGs and immune-related biological processes, suggesting a comprehensive lack of transcriptional immunomodulatory potential on the tumor counterpart. Conversely, Tα1 exhibited to directly affect the proliferation and/or transcription processes of each studied immune cell subset, with the greatest transcriptional impact observed for activated CD8+ T cells, crucial players in anti-tumor immunity. Conclusion Our findings question the tumor immunomodulatory properties of Tα1, simultaneously underscoring the importance of further investigating Tα1 influence on specific immune cell subsets in the periphery or within the tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. This would contribute to understand Tα1 potential in immunotherapy-based combination strategies, within the anti-tumor setting.">

        <tr id="The tumour microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic environment containing diverse cellular, stromal and soluble factors, that collectively influence cancer progression, immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Among the immune components of the TME, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells are key players, whose interactions, particularly their crosstalk, critically shape anti-tumour immunity. The macrophage–NK cell interplay can either promote or suppress immune responses depending on the context, representing both a challenge and a therapeutic opportunity. NK cells are key effectors capable of recognising and eliminating malignant cells without prior sensitisation, whereas macrophages exhibit remarkable plasticity, functioning as either promoters or suppressors of tumour immunity depending on their activation state. This review focuses on current strategies to harness macrophages in cancer therapy, including phenotype repolarisation, selective depletion, and disruption or enhancement of the macrophage-NK cell crosstalk to enhance NK cell-mediated tumour surveillance. Finally, we highlight emerging technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics, as powerful tools to elucidate the dynamic interplay between macrophages and NK cells and inform the next generation of immunotherapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Background Despite the promising results of CAR-T cell therapy, still a significant proportion of patients experience treatment failure due to absence of response, progression or treatment-related toxicities. Our research aims to investigate how the CAR-T cell product characteristics and particularly the percentage of CAR-negative cells present in the infusion product affects its efficacy and safety. Methods CAR-positive (CAR-pos) and CAR-negative (CAR-neg) cells were analyzed during in vitro expansion with IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15. FACS-sorted populations were assessed for cytotoxic effect and secretion of cytokines. Transcriptomic analyses were conducted for CAR-pos and CAR-neg populations. Results A significant reduction in the percentage of transduced (CAR-pos) T cells was observed throughout the in vitro cell culture, where CAR-neg T cells displayed greater expansion along the procedure compared to CAR-pos T cells, using either IL-2 or IL-7/IL-15. CAR-pos T cells exhibited increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. Comparative analyses of CAR-pos and CAR-neg showed an increased cytotoxic effect in purified samples with 100% CAR-pos T cells compared to non-purified product. Quantification of cytokine levels revealed a significant decrease in IL-6 in purified compared to non-purified products. RNA sequencing analysis revealed significant differential gene expression profile between CAR-pos and CAR-neg cells, the prior exhibiting an upregulation of genes associated with immune checkpoint regulation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and Th1/Th2 and Th17 cell differentiation pathways. Conclusion CAR-neg T cells exhibit a significantly greater expansion compared to CAR-pos T cells alongside CAR-T cell production. The percentage of CAR-neg cells influences the specific cytotoxicity of the product and on the cytokine pattern, which might influence both efficacy and toxicity and, therefore, the number of CAR-neg T cells within the infusion product must be considered in the clinical setting. Purification of CAR-pos T cells could potentially optimize product characteristics.

        <tr id="Inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), are markedly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis (ICI-M). Endomyocardial biopsies from these patients also show GBP-associated inflammasome overexpression. While both factors are implicated in ICI-M pathophysiology, their interplay and cellular targets remain poorly characterized. Our aim was to elucidate how ICI-M-associated cytokines affect the viability and inflammatory responses of endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models. ECs and CMs were differentiated from the same hiPSC line derived from a healthy donor. Cells were exposed either to IFN-γ alone or to an inflammatory cytokine cocktail (CCL5, GZMB, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α). We assessed large-scale transcriptomic changes via microarray and evaluated inflammatory, apoptotic, and cell death pathways at cellular and molecular levels. hiPSC-ECs were highly sensitive to cytokine exposure, displaying significant mortality and marked transcriptomic changes in immunity- and inflammation-related pathways. In contrast, hiPSC-CM showed limited transcriptional changes and reduced susceptibility to cytokine-induced death. In both cell types, cytokine treatment upregulated key components of the inflammasome pathway, including regulators (GBP5, GBP6, P2X7, NLRC5), a core component (AIM2), and the effector GSDMD. Increased GBP5 expression and CASP-1 cleavage mirrored the findings found elsewhere in endomyocardial biopsies from ICI-M patients. This hiPSC-based model reveals a distinct cellular sensitivity to ICI-M-related inflammation, with endothelial cells showing heightened vulnerability. These results reposition endothelial dysfunction, rather than cardiomyocyte injury alone, as a central mechanism in ICI-induced myocarditis. Modulating endothelial inflammasome activation, particularly via AIM2 inhibition, could offer a novel strategy to mitigate cardiac toxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) have demonstrated significant clinical benefit in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status, yet a substantial subset of patients remains resistant to therapy. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance and identifying new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Methods We established a murine MC38-based MSI-H CRC model to investigate the variability in PD-1 treatment response and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumors from patients with PD-1-sensitive and PD-1-resistant CRC. Immune cell subsets and signaling pathways were analyzed using CellChat and AUCell, and gene expression enrichment was performed. Functional assays, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, qRT-PCR, and Co-IP, were employed to characterize the role of MNDA and its downstream targets. Results scRNA-seq analysis revealed a significant enrichment of polymorphonuclear neutrophil myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) in PD-1-resistant MSI-H CRC, accompanied by increased lactylation activity and high MNDA expression. Further investigations revealed that MNDA recruits the histone acetyltransferase EP300 to the CXCR2 promoter, mediating H3K18 lactylation and enhancing CXCR2 transcription. This promotes PMN-MDSC infiltration and the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby impairing PD-1 efficacy. Inhibition of the MNDA/EP300-CXCR2 axis reversed H3K18la modification, reduced PMN-MDSC infiltration, remodeled the immune microenvironment, and restored sensitivity to PD-1 therapy. Conclusions Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which MNDA-driven H3K18 lactylation of the CXCR2 promoter facilitates immune evasion and PD-1 resistance in MSI-H CRC. Targeting the MNDA/EP300-CXCR2 regulatory axis represents a promising strategy for overcoming ICI resistance and enhancing the therapeutic benefit in CRC.

        <tr id="Currently approved type 1 diabetes (T1D) immunotherapies broadly target T cells and delay but do not fully prevent diabetes development, highlighting the need for more selective targets. Anti-insulin germinal center B cells are uniquely able to present pathogenic insulin epitopes and drive anti-insulin T cells to adopt a T follicular helper fate. T cell expression of BCL6, a key transcriptional repressor in the germinal center response, is essential for spontaneous diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, the impact of T cells on pro-pathogenic anti-insulin B cell activity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that VH125SD.NOD mice with T cell loss of BCL6 still produce peripheral anti-insulin B cells yet are protected against diabetes (relative to Bcl6-sufficient controls). This protection was associated with reduced activation, proliferation, germinal center differentiation, and pancreatic infiltration of insulin-binding B cells. Minimally supervised analysis revealed insulin-binding B cells skew towards atypical memory B cell subsets specifically in pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes, which was reduced by Bcl6ΔCD4 loss. Overall, this work suggests BCL6-expressing T cells are pivotal to license pathogenic insulin-binding B cells. Our findings support BCL6 inhibition as a promising T1D immunotherapy, even after insulin autoimmunity is established in the B cell repertoire.">

In this study we demonstrated the activation of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint by ZIKV. mRNA and protein expression of PD-L1 was boosted by ZIKV not only in SF268 and JEG3 cell lines but also in human dendritic cells. PD-1 expression was more abundant on CD8+ T cells in ZIKV-infected mice. Elevated PD-L1 expression was also observed in the brain, testis and spleen of ZIKV-infected A129 mice. Blocking PD-L1 effectively inhibited ZIKV infection, reducing viral loads in all tissues. In addition, anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment further increased virus-specific CD8+ T cells, KLRG+ CD8+ T cells, and effector memory CD8+ T cells. PD-L1 blockade also induced interferon γ, granzyme B, and interleukin 2 expression in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, consistent with activation of these cells. Mechanistically, the induction of PD-L1 expression might be ascribed to viral NS4B protein and its interaction with GRP78. Our findings suggest that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could have antiviral effect against ZIKV.">

        <tr id="Invasive candidiasis, primarily caused by Candida albicans, represents the most common fungal disease among hospitalized patients and poses a significant threat to human health. Intrinsic or acquired immunosuppression serves as a critical risk factor predisposing individuals to this disease, while simultaneously reducing the efficacy of conventional antifungal therapies and worsening clinical outcomes. Given the central role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of invasive candidiasis, immunotherapeutic strategies hold substantial promise. We targeted dectin-1, the primary pattern recognition receptor for β-1,3-glucan, by engineering XJ104, a bispecific T-cell engager that fuses dectin-1 to the light chains of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. This construct is designed to bridge Candida β-1,3-glucan with CD3 on T cells, thereby inducing anti-Candida immunity. Our results demonstrate that XJ104 exhibits high specificity for β-1,3-glucan and activates effector cells in a Candida-dependent manner in vitro. In murine models, XJ104 enhances Th1 and Th17 responses and confers significant protection against both C. albicans and non-albicans infections. Crucially, CD3+ T-cell depletion and cytokine neutralization abolished this protection, confirming the T-cell-dependent protective efficacy of XJ104. These results establish that enhancing the endogenous T-cell function represents an effective strategy against invasive candidiasis. In conclusion, our study presents a novel therapeutic approach that bridges T cells and Candida pathogens, promoting robust Candida-specific immunity and controlling invasive infections caused by Candida spp. These findings underscore the potential of XJ104 as a clinically promising immunotherapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.">

FK228 serves as a novel necroptosis inducer in cancer cells by triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress. This in turn enhances the immunogenicity of cancer cells and increases the infiltration of tumor-killing immunocytes, including CD8+ T and natural killer cells, particularly activating tumor-infiltrated CD8+ T cells. Meanwhile, FK228 treatment shifts macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, the combined use of FK228 and a PD-L1 inhibitor significantly delay tumor growth and extend the survival of tumor bearing mice. Overall, our findings reveal new possibilities for the clinical application of FK228 in solid tumors and underscore the critical role of histone deacetylases in maintaining the immune-unfavorable TIME.">

        <tr id="Perineural invasion (PNI) is a well-established factor of poor prognosis in multiple cancer types1, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide clinical and mechanistic insights into the role of PNI and cancer-induced nerve injury (CINI) in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study demonstrates that PNI and CINI of tumour-associated nerves are associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy among patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and gastric cancer. Electron microscopy and electrical conduction analyses reveal that cancer cells degrade the nerve fibre myelin sheets. The injured neurons respond by autonomously initiating IL-6- and type I interferon-mediated inflammation to promote nerve healing and regeneration. As the tumour grows, the CINI burden increases, and its associated inflammation becomes chronic and skews the general immune tone within the tumour microenvironment into a suppressive and exhaustive state. The CINI-driven anti-PD-1 resistance can be reversed by targeting multiple steps in the CINI signalling process: denervating the tumour, conditional knockout of the transcription factor mediating the injury signal within neurons (Atf3), knockout of interferon-α receptor signalling (Ifnar1−/−) or by combining anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6-receptor blockade. Our findings demonstrate the direct immunoregulatory roles of CINI and its therapeutic potential.">

        <tr id="Tumors frequently evade immune destruction by impairing cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses, highlighting the need for strategies that restore T-cell functionality. Here, we identify SLAMF7 (CD319) as a key enhancer of human CD8+ T-cell responses against tumors. SLAMF7 expression is induced by pro-inflammatory signals such as IL-12 and CD28 co-stimulation. Agonistic SLAMF7 signaling, in synergy with TCR activation, is able to strongly induce T-cell activation and clonal expansion, a finding consistently observed in CD8+ T cells from healthy adults as well as derived from blood and tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Moreover it drives a distinct differentiation programme characterized by elevated expression of key transcription factors Eomes and T-bet, leading to increased production of effector molecules such as Interferon γ, Granzyme B and Perforin. In contrast to CD28 costimulation, SLAMF7 activation also promotes serial killing potential via BTLA induction. In antigen-specific human models, SLAMF7 activation boosts CD8+ T-cell responses against the tumor-associated antigen NY-ESO-1, a key target in several cancers including HNSCC. Moreover, combining SLAMF7 activation with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade synergistically enhances cytokine release and cytotoxic potential, highlighting its potential to overcome immunosuppression and reinvigorate antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Porcine‐to‐human islet xenotransplantation offers a promising solution to type 1 diabetes. This study investigates the use of Belimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits B cell activating factor (BAFF) as part of an immunosuppressive regimen in porcine‐to‐non‐human primate xenotransplantation. Methods Porcine islets were transplanted into Rhesus monkeys with an immunosuppressant regimen. Blood samples were collected from the monkeys pre‐ and post‐treatment, and single‐cell RNA sequencing was performed to investigate immune cell landscape changes, focusing on B cells. Results UMAP clustering of B cells identified five distinct subsets. Notably, Belimumab treatment significantly reduced the proportion of both CXCR5+ and CXCR5− atypical memory B cells, which possess the potential to differentiate into antibody‐secreting cells. Furthermore, differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed a comprehensive functional impairment, along with significant downregulation of activation markers such as CD69 and CD83, across all B cell subsets. Conclusions Our study elucidates the mechanism of action of Belimumab in non‐human primate models, serving as preclinical subjects for B‐cell–targeted therapy research in a xenotransplantation context. Significantly, our data indicate that Belimumab not only reduces the proportion of antibody‐secreting atypical memory B cells but also induces functional impairment across all B cell subsets. Given the potential pathogenic roles of atypical memory B cells in autoimmunity and other related settings, their reduction by Belimumab could play a crucial role in regulating B‐cell–mediated immune responses in pig‐to‐non‐human primate pancreatic islet xenotransplantation. Thus, our findings highlight the prospective utility of Belimumab as a B cell suppressant in future clinical xenotransplantation applications.">

These functions contribute to cancer immunity and have been previously linked to the induction of anti‐tumour CD8+ T cells and enhanced responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by sustained synovial inflammation and the gradual destruction of joint structures. Although conventional T cells have historically been viewed as central to RA pathogenesis, increasing attention has recently focused on unconventional T cell subsets, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and gamma delta T (γδ T) cells. Functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, these cells contribute to RA immunopathogenesis by producing cytokines, exerting cytotoxic effects, and interacting with various immune and stromal cells. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the immunological characteristics and pathogenic roles of unconventional T cell subsets in RA. NKT, MAIT, and γδ T cells contribute to the amplification of inflammatory responses and joint tissue destruction through diverse mechanisms, exhibiting unique tissue tropism and functional plasticity. Recently, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed to target these subsets, including modulation of antigen presentation pathways, inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, and reprogramming of cellular functionalities. Advancements in single-cell omics and spatial immune profiling have facilitated the precise identification and characterization of pathogenic unconventional T cell subsets in the RA synovium, thereby paving the way for personalized immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), traditionally characterized in innate immune cells, are emerging as critical modulators of T cell function. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), STING, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and natural killer receptors (NKRs) are expressed by CD8+ T cells, where they influence various cellular responses. Primarily serving as noncanonical costimulatory signals, TLRs can modulate T cell activation, differentiation, metabolic fitness, and memory formation. RLRs and STING can promote T cell expansion and cytokine production. Both activating and inhibitory NKRs can also alter T cell cytotoxicity and differentiation. As demonstrated in recent advancements, the capacity of these signaling cascades to enhance T cell responses offers promising therapeutic opportunities in cancer. Clinical strategies are being developed to selectively harness each of these pathways, such as TLR and STING agonists to bolster antitumor responses, and NKR-based approaches to amplify cytotoxic function. Additionally, adoptive T cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, are incorporating these innate signaling components to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression, enhance functional longevity, and improve therapeutic efficacy. This review discusses the progress made to characterize the role of T cell intrinsic PRR activity in shaping T cell functions and highlights recent advancements in that leverage innate receptor signaling to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.">

Stem cell-derived β-cells (sBC) provide a renewable source but remain vulnerable to immune attack. We engineered human pluripotent stem cells to express either the wildtype (WT) or a high-affinity mutant (Mut) variant (rs1058402, G>A; Ala67Thr) of the NK and T cell checkpoint inhibitor CD155 before differentiation into sBC. Modified sBC maintained upregulated CD155 expression and showed enhanced binding to co-receptor ligands. Co-culture studies revealed that CD155 Mut-expressing sBC suppressed CD8+ T cell and NK cell activation and proliferation by preferentially engaging the co-inhibitory receptor TIGIT. Both CD155 Mut sBC lines reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell- and NK cell-mediated sBC destruction and cytotoxic molecule secretion. This protection was lost with TIGIT blockade, confirming the role of CD155-TIGIT signaling in antagonizing immune cell-mediated killing. Our findings suggest that high-affinity CD155 expression enhances immune evasion of sBC, improving their potential for restorative therapy in T1D.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are highly plastic immune cells that adopt diverse functional states in response to the local microenvironment. The traditional M1/M2 polarization model that has long been used to describe macrophage activation is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of macrophage diversity observed in vivo. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed that macrophages exist in a continuum of transcriptional states formed by tissue-specific and disorder-specific cues. This insight has led to the recognition of disorder-specific macrophages, defined as macrophage subpopulations that emerge in response to pathological stimuli and play unique roles in disease progression. These macrophages exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures, epigenetic modifications, and functional properties shaped by their ontogeny and microenvironmental signals, arising from the reprogramming of resident macrophages or the differentiation of bone marrow–derived progenitors. Notable examples include macrophages in chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis), immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, lipid-associated macrophages in obesity, and disease-associated microglia in neurodegeneration. These subsets exhibit unique regulatory mechanisms, including enhancer remodeling driven by histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, CCAAT enhancer binding protein α-mediated differentiation in obesity, and Jmjd3-IRF4 axis control in allergic inflammation. Additionally, their function and fate are strongly influenced by their subtissular niche, as evidenced by crown-like structures in adipose tissue, tumor microenvironments, fibrotic lesions, and granulomas, where distinct microenvironmental cues shape macrophage behavior. Furthermore, interindividual heterogeneity in macrophage function, driven by genetic polymorphisms, is increasingly recognized, highlighting the role of host genetic background in disease susceptibility and macrophage-driven pathology. Here, we review the conceptual evolution of the disorder-specific macrophage, tracing its origins from the limited M1/M2 model to its refinement through scRNA-seq-based classification. We summarize the ontogeny, transcriptional regulation, and spatial heterogeneity of these macrophages across various disorders, emphasizing how the subtissular niche dictates functional specialization. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting disorder-specific macrophage subsets, highlighting the need for integrative multi-omics approaches to refine their classification and functional characterization. Understanding the regulatory networks that govern disorder-specific macrophages will advance our knowledge of macrophage biology while facilitating the development of precision medicine for immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy against cancer, but many patients fail to achieve durable responses. Inefficiency of immunotherapy is often caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Previously, we demonstrated that treatment with an FcαRI-stimulating bi-specific antibody (BsAb), designed to recruit myeloid cells as cytotoxic effector cells, significantly decreased tumor growth in a murine cancer model. Nonetheless, complete tumor eradication was not achieved. In this study, we investigated if co-treatment with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α enhances the therapeutic efficacy of FcαRI BsAb. Although TNF-α did not affect antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of tumor cells, macrophage polarization, or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer cells, its combination with FcαRI BsAb increased tumor cell trogocytosis, neutrophil degranulation and tumor cell death. To exploit this synergy, we engineered a TNF-α x FcαRI bi-specific immunocytokine (FcαRI-TNF). Surface plasmon resonance and cellular binding assays demonstrated that FcαRI-TNF retained binding affinities for FcαRI, FcɣRIII, and the tumor-associated antigen EGFR comparable to FcαRI BsAb. Consistent with the combination of TNF-α and FcαRI BsAb, FcαRI-TNF neither influenced macrophage function nor polarization but enhanced neutrophil-mediated tumor killing in vitro. Intravital imaging in a murine MC38-cEGFR tumor model showed that FcαRI-TNF promoted in vivo neutrophil activation and swarming behavior. These findings suggest that FcαRI-TNF represents a promising candidate to improve neutrophil-driven immunotherapy of cancer.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that mostly affects kids and teens. The biggest danger is when the cancer spreads to the lungs, and current treatments do not work well for those cases. Immunotherapy, which helps the body’s immune system fight cancer, has worked for other cancers but is limited for osteosarcoma because we do not fully understand the environment around the tumor. Our research looked at various cells around the tumor to study why patients have worse outcomes. We found that certain cells, called M2 macrophages (M2) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which weaken the immune system, are very common in these tumors. When there are a lot of these cells, the cancer is more likely to come back. Even worse, when these immune-suppressing cells are very close to M2 in the tumor, the cancer is much more likely to spread to the patient’s lungs. We further showed that M2 helps cancer spread to the lungs in mice. We also discovered that M2 releases a protein called MIP-1α (CCL3), which enhances the ability of cancer cells to spread. These findings could help create new treatments to target these cells and stop the cancer from spreading.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the most formidable infectious diseases globally. The immune system orchestrates a complex response including, but not limited to, T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) to control and eliminate Mtb. While these cells are well-recognized for their roles in anti-tumor immunity, their contributions to the defense against Mtb are equally critical. This review delves into the specific mechanisms by which these immune cells release cytotoxic enzymes and effector molecules, offering new insights into their pivotal roles in Mtb clearance. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms is essential for developing more effective strategies to combat tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health challenge and current therapies are not always effective. In addition, certain immune cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), pose a significant barrier to immune-based treatments. Some phytochemicals, particularly compounds derived from Allium spp. like Propyl-Propane Thiosulfonate (PTSO), have shown strong immunomodulatory potential in digestive disorders. This study aims to investigate the capacity of PTSO to modulate immune responses and affect tumor progression in CRC models, in vitro and in vivo, with a focus on the immune cell populations that comprise the tumor microenvironment. Methods: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were incubated with PTSO (25 μM for 48 h) and characterized by flow cytometry. These cells (1 × 106) were then injected into NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunodeficient mice, which were simultaneously induced to develop a subcutaneous tumor by injection of HCT116 enriched cancer stem cells (CSCs) colonospheres (60,000 cells/mouse). Results: PTSO reduced MDSC populations, specifically, it significantly reduced monocytic (M-MDSCs, Control: 7.27 ± 0.53% vs. PTSO: 4.70 ± 2.39%; p = 0.0458) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSCs, Control: 5.28 ± 0.99% vs. PTSO: 3.41 ± 1.58%; p = 0.0385) MDSCs. In parallel, PTSO increased T cell subpopulations, particularly interferon gamma (IFNG)-producing cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Control: 9.52 ± 2.06% vs. PTSO: 15.04 ± 5.01%; p = 0.0685). In the humanized tumor xenograft mouse, the administration of PTSO-pretreated hPBMCs led to a significant reduction in tumor size (Control: 1.43 ± 0.82 cm3 vs. PTSO: 0.44 ± 0.35 cm3; p = 0.0068), accompanied by increased infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes and Natural Killer (NK) cells and downregulation of immunosuppressive genes. These effects resulted in a reduction in cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. Conclusions: The dual effect of PTSO on immune cell populations, reducing immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhancing effector T lymphocyte and NK cell responses, resulted in an anti-tumor effect, highlighting this bioactive compound as a promising adjuvant in CRC immunotherapy and opening avenues for future research combining immunotherapy with PTSO in alternative models to optimize dosing and enhance translational potential.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer represents a typically immune “cold” tumor, where obvious immunosuppression, spatial T-cell exclusion, and cellular dysfunction collectively limit immunotherapy effectiveness. Especially in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the immune low-response state is driven by complex interactions among tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), suppressive stromal networks, and the T-cell compartment (regulatory T cells, Tregs, and exhausted effector T cells). Emerging multi-omics technologies—particularly single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics—have showed the heterogeneity and spatial immune organization underlying this suppressed state. Here, we integrate these datasets to describe TAM phenotypes and spatial niches, T-cell exhaustion, Tregs accumulation, NK-cell dysfunction, and stromal barriers that enforce exclusion. We then derive phenotype-guided combination strategies to remodel the tumor microenvironment and improve responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. This synthesis provides a concise, multi-dimensional framework for precision immunotherapy and for overcoming resistance in immune-low ovarian cancers.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening complications that can arise following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). GVHD occurs when immune cells—primarily T cells—from the graft recognize host cells as foreign entities and initiate an immune response against host tissues. This immune reaction generally involves a diverse array of cytokines, including interleukins (ILs), which play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response, promoting inflammation, and sustaining immune tolerance. Members of the interleukin family are not only directly involved in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells but also regulate inflammatory responses and the migration of immune cells. Consequently, they significantly influence both the clinical manifestations and prognosis of GVHD. The objective of this study is to review recent advancements in research concerning interleukins and their role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. This study aims to elucidate how interleukins contribute to immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, we will discuss their potential as therapeutic targets, with the intention of providing novel insights and strategies for the clinical management of GVHD.">

        <tr id="Pathogen-specific CD4+ T cells undergo dynamic expansion and contraction during infection, ultimately generating memory clones that shape the subsequent immune responses. However, the influence of distinct tissue environments on the differentiation and clonal selection of polyclonal T cells remains unclear, primarily because of the technical challenges in tracking these cells in vivo. To address this question, we generated Tracking Recently Activated Cell Kinetics (TRACK) mice, a dual-recombinase fate-mapping system that enables precise spatial and temporal labeling of recently activated CD4+ T cells. Using TRACK mice during influenza infection, we observed organ-specific clonal selection and transcriptional differentiation in the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes (medLNs), and spleen. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing revealed that local antigenic landscapes and clonal identity shape repertoire diversity, resulting in a low clonal overlap between tissues during acute infection. During the effector phase, spleen-derived CD4+ T cells preferentially adopted a stem-like migratory phenotype, whereas those activated in the medLNs predominantly differentiated into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Memory formation was associated with increased clonal overlap between lung and medLN-derived cells, whereas splenic clones retained a distinct repertoire. Additionally, memory CD4+ T cells displayed converging antigen specificity across tissues over time. These results highlight the tissue-dependent mechanisms driving clonal selection and functional specialization during infection and underscore how memory development facilitates clonal redistribution and functional convergence.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), comprising up to 50% of the tumor mass, are recruited via chemokine axes such as CCL2/CCR2, CX3CL1/CX3CR1, and CXCL12/CXCR4 and adopt an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype, facilitating immune escape and angiogenesis. Key signaling pathways, including CSF1R, STAT3, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and HIF-1α, regulate TAM function, making them promising therapeutic targets. Strategies such as TAM depletion, reprogramming, and immune checkpoint blockade (PD-1/PD-L1, and CD47-SIRPα) have shown potential in preclinical models. Emerging approaches, including CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy, nanotechnology-based drug delivery, and exosome-mediated modulation, offer new avenues for intervention. However, clinical translation remains challenging due to GBM’s heterogeneity and adaptive resistance mechanisms. Future research should integrate multi-omics profiling and AI-driven drug discovery to refine TAM-targeted therapies and improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Objectives Preclinical models that accurately recapitulate the human immune response, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME), are needed for the translational and predictive testing of new therapies. Here, we examine whether the genO-BRGSF-HIS model—characterized by robust reconstitution of both human lymphoid and myeloid cells following engraftment with CD34+ cord blood cells—could be a translatable mouse model for human tumor biology and a relevant platform for evaluating novel immunotherapies. Methods genO-BRGSF mice were reconstituted with human CD34+ cord blood cells (genO-BRGSF-HIS) and treated with exogenous human Flt3 ligand (hFlt3L). Myeloid and dendritic cell functionality was analyzed following treatment with different compounds (TLR agonists, TREM1 agonist, STING agonist, or T-cell engagers) and following the implantation of different tumor cell lines (MDA-MB-231, A549, HPAF-II). Results We show that myeloid, dendritic and lymphoid cells (including NK and γδ T cells) are functional and recruited into the TME in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice implanted with different tumor cell lines, and that different immune cell populations are activated and get polarized within the TME. The composition of the TME is dependent on tumor type and tumor burden, demonstrating plasticity in the crosstalk between the human immune system and the tumor cells. Furthermore, we observed polarization of the cells recruited to the TME, as well as a wide diversity of recruited cell populations, suggesting that this model reproduces human physiopathology in the context of cancer. Based on the recruitment of the different cell populations according to tumor type, we also demonstrate that this model can be used for testing new therapies targeting lymphoid cells, such as T-cell engagers. Conclusions genO-BRGSF-HIS mice do not exhibit adverse effects associated with the development of human lymphoid and myeloid cells following CD34+ cord blood cell reconstitution, and their extended lifespan allows for longer experimental study windows. Overall, we show that this model develops functional myeloid and lymphoid cells which are recruited to the TME, making it a valuable tool for testing new immunotherapies that modulate the interaction between the tumor and the immune system.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and stromal cells that form at sites of inflammation, providing adaptive immune responses outside of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). Found in various pathological conditions—including chronic infections, cancer, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and allergy—the presence of TLSs is linked to potentiation of local immunity. TLSs can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on context, and have been implicated as prognostic for disease severity and therapy response. Architecturally, TLSs resemble SLOs with distinct T and B cell areas supported by fibroblasts that secrete chemokines and cytokines that support immune cells. These structures must be created de novo in non‐lymphoid tissues; thus, the steps for TLS formation mimic, but do not completely copy, those of SLO formation. The accumulation of immune cells in tissues in inflammatory settings can initiate remodeling of tissue fibroblasts, leading to TLS formation; this process is common across tissues, although there are tissue‐ and disease‐specific pathways that impact TLS formation in certain contexts. This review will explore the immune‐stromal crosstalk in kidney, lung, and skin TLSs across a range of disease settings, highlighting shared as well as tissue‐specific mechanisms for TLS formation.">

However, glioblastoma inevitably recurs, suggesting RT does not generate a long-lasting immune response. This may be due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and/or RT-induced immune evasion. Our ﬁndings show that RT promotes fatty acid synthase (FASN)-mediated lipid synthesis, a metabolic program that reportedly suppresses IFN-I in viral immunity. We hypothesized that FASN induction similarly inhibits IFN-I in irradiated glioblastoma, limiting antitumor immunity. We aim to determine whether FASN blockade restores IFN-I signaling, enhances immune inﬁltration, and improves RT and immunotherapy eﬃcacy.



 Murine glioblastoma cells were subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FASN knockout or treated with FASN in- hibitors (FASNi), then irradiated (6Gy) and analyzed 24h post-RT using RNA sequencing, LEGENDplex, and ELISA. In vivo, glioblastoma-bearing mice received FASNi (days 9-30), anti-PD-1 (twice weekly, days 15-24), and fractionated RT (5×6Gy, days 10-14). Survival was monitored (n=7/group), and tumor immune inﬁltration was assessed at day 20 using ﬂow cytometry and multiplex imaging. Long-term survivors (>100 days) were rechal- lenged in the contralateral hemisphere. In some experiments, mice received anti-CD8 or anti-IFNAR antibodies.



 Transcriptome analysis identiﬁed IFN-I signaling as the most enriched pathway in irradiated FASN-knockout cells, conﬁrmed by increased IFN-I protein levels. In vivo, RT+FASNi inﬂamed glioblastoma tumors, enhancing CD11c and CD8 T-cell inﬁltration. Remarkably, adding anti-PD-1 to RT+FASNi further improved survival, with 86% of mice tumor-free at 100 days vs. 43% in other RT-treated groups. Rechallenged RT+FASNi+anti-PD-1 survivors did not develop a tumor when compared to naïve animals, demonstrating immunological memory. CD8 depletion or IFNAR blockade abrogated this effect, highlighting the critical role of IFN-I and CD8



 FASN inhibition restores IFN-I responses in irradiated glioblastoma, enhancing immune inﬁltration and im- munotherapy eﬃcacy. These ﬁndings highlight FASN as a key target to shift glioblastoma from immunosup- pressive to immunoresponsive.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) have demonstrated promising results in patients with solid tumors, yet the immunological mechanisms influencing their efficacy require further investigation. T cell exhaustion, induced by prolonged antigen exposure, is known to compromise T cell-based immunotherapies, but its effect on TCB efficacy remains unclear. Herein, we assessed the TCB efficacy on tumor-specific T cells, emphasizing their functional status. Utilizing an immunocompetent mouse model with melanoma expressing an immunogenic antigen, we showed that tumor-specific T cells acquire an exhausted phenotype and fail to expand under TCB treatment. Both mouse and human tumor-specific T cells in vitro demonstrated that chronically stimulated T cells exhibit a reduced response to TCBs. The comparison of TCB efficacy in T cell-inflamed versus non-inflamed tumors in mice revealed TCB success depends more on T cell functional fitness than their initial abundance. These data underscore the importance of T cell exhaustion, suggesting that exhausted tumor-specific T cells are unlikely to be the primary effectors redirected by TCBs for tumor eradication. Our study highlights the need to maintain T cell fitness and prevent exhaustion to enhance TCB therapy outcomes, which may help identify patients who could benefit most from TCB treatments in clinics.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Despite comparable survival benefit has been obtained, the drug resistance remarkably reduced lenvatinib clinical efficacy. Here, we aimed to identify the potential mechanism by which cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) regulates the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and participates in the resistance to lenvatinib. Methods We harnessed RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) injection HCC model to systematically explore the function of CSRP2 in HCC progression. To precisely delineate how immunosuppressive macrophages, influenced by CSRP2-regulated C-C motif chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28) signaling, respond to lenvatinib-induced cytotoxicity, we established an in vitro co-culture system and conducted functional cytotoxicity assays. Results Using RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence staining and HTV injection HCC mouse model, we identified CSRP2 as one of the most significantly upregulated genes in HCC tissues. CSRP2 overexpression drives anti-lenvatinib resistance by inducing high levels of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) infiltration and reshaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Then flow cytometry, mass spectrometry and chromatin immunoprecipitation were conducted to clarify the underlying mechanism of CSRP2. We showed CSRP2 promotes phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) at Thr69/71, leading to the transcriptional activation of CCL28 expression. HCC-derived CCL28 recruits TAMs to drive immunosuppression and anti-lenvatinib tolerance. BI6901, a potent and selective CCR10 antagonist, blocked TAMs recruitment and enhanced T-cell activation. Combining CCR10 inhibition improved the therapeutic benefit of anti-lenvatinib in HCC. Conclusions These results illustrate that CSRP2 regulates the tumor microenvironment to promote HCC growth and drive lenvatinib tolerance via the CSRP2/ATF2/CCL28 axis. Targeting this pathway could synergize with lenvatinib to treat HCC more effectively.">

Current knowledge of the diverse and dynamic cellular components of the TIME underscores how the immune landscape evolves in response to immunotherapy. This review highlights the importance of understanding the TIME for advancing cancer immunotherapy by integrating insights from basic biology and clinical practice with recent advances in science and technology, paving the way for more personalized cancer therapies through modern medical innovations. The cellular and molecular compositions of the TIME and the cellular interactions will be explored. Next, we summarize how the TIME is shaped by immune activation and suppression through various mechanisms of action. Immunotherapies designed to enhance host immune function are discussed in detail to visualize and quantify cellular dynamics within the TIME once treated with immunotherapy. In particular, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly enhanced early cancer detection and diagnostics by analyzing patient samples with greater precision.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Disialoganglioside (GD2) is a tumor-associated antigen that is highly expressed in various neuroectodermal cancers, including melanoma. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy has demonstrated remarkable success in treating hematologic neoplasms, the identification of suitable targets remains a major obstacle in translating this approach to solid tumors.


METHODS
Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from six healthy donors were used to generate GD2-specific CAR T cells via retroviral transduction. The resulting GD2.CAR T cells were characterized by NanoString transcriptome profiling, flow cytometry with hierarchical stochastic neighbor embedding (HSNE) dimensionality reduction, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays against GD2+ and GD2- melanoma cell lines. In vivo experiments were also performed using GD2+ xenograft models and a single intratumoral dose of 8 × 106 GD2.CAR T cells.


RESULT
The GD2.CAR T cell population exhibited a predominantly naive phenotype (CD8+CD40L+CD69‒CD107a+4-1BB+FasL+) and effective anti-tumor mechanisms involving the granzyme A/B axis, the Fas/FasL axis, and cytokine release. Transcriptome analysis revealed transduction-related effects on proliferation and a shift towards an effector phenotype during early co-culture with tumor cells, accompanied by upregulation of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and cytokine signaling genes. GD2.CAR T cells demonstrated robust cytotoxicity against GD2+ melanoma cells in vitro, while significant in vivo tumor control was observed in xenograft models.


CONCLUSION
GD2.CAR T cells demonstrate potent anti-tumor activity against melanoma in vitro and in vivo, highlighting their therapeutic potential and warranting further clinical investigation.">

        <tr id="Abstract The effectiveness of T cell–based immunotherapy depends on durable T-cell responses that can efficiently eliminate tumor cells. NKG7 was discovered three decades ago as a protein associated with lytic granules. However, only studies published over the past 5 years have contributed substantially to our understanding of NKG7 in T-cell biology. NKG7 has been recognized as an important T-cell functional marker in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and in the prognosis of certain cancers. Besides its role in the generation, trafficking, and release of lytic granules, which is critical for efficient T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells, NKG7 has been identified as a key negative regulator of mTORC1 activity. By restraining mTORC1 activity, NKG7 promotes T-cell longevity and memory generation after infection. Importantly, NKG7 upregulation has demonstrated therapeutic potential in preclinical T-cell therapy for cancer. Collectively, NKG7 is emerging as a promising biomarker and therapeutic addition to T cell–based immunotherapies.">

Humanized mice with a human immune system have advanced understanding of human immunity, yet suboptimal myelopoiesis and lack of functional neutrophils remain challenges. We developed MaGIC mice, a model expressing human CD47, M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and thrombopoietin while reducing murine CD47 on the C57Bl/6 N background. MaGIC mice support robust human hematopoiesis, including functional neutrophils, monocytes, and tissue macrophages.

As cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the primary focus has been on the cytotoxic capabilities and antigen specificity of these subsets. A recently identified subset, Granzyme k (Gzmk)+ CD8 T cells, has been closely associated with inflammatory diseases, independent of their cytotoxic function. Unlike other granzymes, granzyme K predominantly induces proinflammatory responses in tissues or cells rather than mediating cytotoxicity.

        <tr id="Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-MPNs) are clonal hematologic malignancies characterized not only by driver mutations such as JAK2V617F, CALR, and MPL but also by a profoundly dysregulated immune microenvironment. Chronic inflammation and immune remodeling sustain malignant hematopoiesis and contribute to disease progression from essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) to overt myelofibrosis (MF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines—including IL-2, IFN-α, IL-23, and TNF-α—drive abnormal T cell polarization, favoring a pathogenic Th17 phenotype. Lymphocyte subset analysis reveals a predominance of exhausted PD-1+ T cells, reflecting impaired immune surveillance. Concurrently, alterations in neutrophil apoptosis lead to persistent inflammation and stromal activation. GRO-α (CXCL1) is elevated in ET but reduced in MF, suggesting a subtype-specific role in disease biology. Fibrosis-promoting factors such as TGF-β and IL-13 mediate bone marrow remodeling and megakaryocyte expansion, while VEGF and other angiogenic factors enhance vascular niche alterations, particularly in PV. These immunopathologic features underscore novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. In addition to JAK inhibition, targeted strategies such as CXCR1/2 antagonists, anti-TGF-β agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) may offer disease-modifying potential. Understanding the interplay between cytokine signaling and immune cell dysfunction is crucial for developing precision immunotherapies in MPNs.">

        <tr id="Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with chronic liver inflammation being a major risk factor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with improved survival and better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in several cancers. However, their role in HCC remains unclear, and findings are often contradictory. Methods: The study investigated the presence and composition of TLSs across multiple liver disease models, including livers containing HCC. TLSs were characterized to identify the essential cellular components for functional lymphoid activity. The functional role of age-associated B cells (ABCs) was further explored by blocking T-bet expression in B cells, thereby preventing their differentiation into ABCs. Results: TLS frequency was increased in livers containing HCC. Characterization confirmed the presence of key immune cell subsets supporting lymphoid function. Blocking T-bet in B cells led to a reduction in ABCs, which resulted in smaller TLS, a specific decrease in hepatic B cells, and reduced tumor lesion size in HCC-bearing mice. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ABCs promote TLS formation and growth, facilitating B-cell recruitment to the liver and supporting HCC progression. Targeting T-bet–dependent ABC differentiation may represent a novel strategy to limit TLS formation and slow HCC progression.">

AFM28 induces autologous anti-leukemic activity in fresh AML whole blood cultures, demonstrating its potential to enhance NK cell function from AML patients. Responsiveness can be further enhanced by allogeneic NK cell addition. Anti-leukemic activity of AFM28 is confirmed in xenograft mouse models. In addition, AFM28 is well tolerated and demonstrates pharmacodynamic activity in cynomolgus monkeys.

Functional assays demonstrated that CD2 knockdown inhibited cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity, leading to impaired tumor cell recognition and enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo studies showed that CD2‐deficient CTLs promoted tumor growth and brain metastasis while affecting metabolic reprogramming by altering key enzyme expressions in pyrimidine biosynthesis and arginine metabolism pathways. The findings suggest that CD2 enhances CTL function against tumor cells and influences their metabolic states, highlighting the role of CD2 in remodeling the brain metastatic microenvironment in breast cancer.">

These cells employ unique antigen recognition mechanisms to trigger rapid immune responses. γδ T cells facilitate early pathogen elimination and immune regulation, whereas MAIT cells detect microbial metabolites and modulate the systemic inflammation. NKT cells balance immune homeostasis through dual pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production.

        <tr id="The anti-tumor function of T cells in the ovarian cancer (OC) microenvironment influences the prognosis of OC. Previous studies have indicated that metabolic competition among microenvironmental cells regulates the function of immune cells. Recent research has shown that NAD+ metabolism plays a significant role in modulating immune cell activity, and increasing NAD+ levels is a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the effector functions of immune cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms of NAD+ metabolism on the anti-tumor function of T cells in the OC microenvironment remain unclear. This study found that exogenous supplementation of NAM to increase NAD+ levels in T cells significantly activates the endogenous p-STING axis and downstream interferon signaling within T cells, thereby enhancing T cell activation and anti-tumor effects. Concurrently, we discovered that elevated NAD+ levels promote the retention of STING on the Golgi apparatus. Mechanistically, we elucidated that the increase in NAD+ levels mediated by NAM downregulates the expression of SURF4 protein through ubiquitination and degradation, subsequently activating the p-STING axis in T cells. Furthermore, exogenous NAM supplementation can further enhance the activation of the T cell STING axis by PARP inhibitor (PARPi)-treated OC cells, and the combination of PARPi and NAM significantly augments the anti-tumor function of T cells, inhibiting the progression of OC. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the regulation of T cell anti-tumor function by NAD+, highlighting the potential strategy of targeting T cell metabolic reprogramming for the treatment of OC.">

        <tr id="Background: Most immunologically “cold” tumors do not respond durably to checkpoint blockade because tumor antigen (TA) release and presentation are insufficient to prime effective T-cell immunity. While prior work demonstrated synergy between cisplatin and a TLR7/8/9 agonist (CR108) in 4T1 tumors, the underlying mechanism—particularly whether chemotherapy functions as a broad antigen-releasing agent enabling TLR-driven immune amplification—remained undefined. Methods: Using murine models of breast (4T1), melanoma (B16-F10), and colorectal cancer (CT26), we tested multiple chemotherapeutic classes combined with CR108. We quantified intratumoral and systemic soluble TAs, antigen presentation and cross-priming by antigen-presenting cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and cytokine production by flow cytometry/ICS. T-cell receptor β (TCRβ) repertoire dynamics in tumor-draining lymph nodes were profiled to assess amplitude and breadth. Tumor microenvironment remodeling was analyzed, and public datasets (e.g., TCGA basal-like breast cancer) were interrogated for expression of genes linked to TA generation/processing and peptide loading. Results: Using cisplatin + CR108 in 4T1 as a benchmark, we demonstrate that diverse chemotherapies—especially platinum agents—broadly increase the repertoire of soluble tumor antigens available for immune recognition. Across regimens, chemotherapy combined with CR108 increased T-cell recognition of candidate TAs and enhanced IFN-γ+ CD8+ responses, with platinum agents producing the largest expansions in soluble TAs. TCRβ sequencing revealed increased clonal amplitude without loss of repertoire breadth, indicating focused yet diverse antitumor T-cell expansion. Notably, therapeutic efficacy was not predicted by canonical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signatures but instead correlated with antigen availability and processing capacity. In human basal-like breast cancer, higher expression of genes involved in TA generation and antigen processing/presentation correlated with improved survival. Conclusions: Our findings establish an antigen-centric mechanism underlying chemo–TLR agonist synergy: chemotherapy liberates a broadened repertoire of tumor antigens, which CR108 then leverages via innate immune activation to drive potent, T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. This framework for rational selection of chemotherapy partners for TLR7/8/9 agonism and support clinical evaluation to convert “cold” tumors into immunologically responsive disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) presents significant challenges for the treatment of this disease. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most successful strategies in cancer treatment, especially for advanced HCC. Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors have moderate efficacy as monotherapies for HCC. Tumor angiogenesis, a crucial factor in tumor growth and proliferation, plays a pivotal role in the immune regulation of HCC. The vascular and immune microenvironments of solid tumors engage in dynamic reciprocal crosstalk, forming a complex vascular–immune axis that critically shapes antitumor immune responses and drives therapy resistance. The high degree of angiogenesis observed in HCC leads to abnormal vascular structure and function, which not only promotes tumor growth but also induces hypoxia and acidosis within the TME, thereby suppressing the immune response through various mechanisms. Given the regulatory role of tumor blood vessels in the immune system, the integration of antiangiogenic therapy into current immunotherapy approaches provides a novel treatment option. This integration involves the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, improvements in the TME, and enhancements of the immune response, among other mechanisms. This review summarizes the angiogenic mechanisms of HCC, the clinical applications of immunotherapy and the regulatory effects of angiogenesis on the immune response in HCC.">

 Adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies have shown limited efficacy against most solid tumors. A key barrier to success is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Beyond local effects, tumors induce systemic immune disturbances that further hinder anti-tumor immunity and promote disease progression. In this study, we investigate how tumor-driven systemic immunosuppression compromises the function of both endogenous and adoptively transferred natural killer (NK) cells, identifying potential strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes.



 We utilized syngeneic murine cancer models to systematically characterize alterations in immune cell populations within the circulation and spleen. Comprehensive and in-depth assessment of immune cell function, transcriptional activity, and metabolic state was performed using flow cytometry, Seahorse metabolic analysis, RNA sequencing, metabolic tracing, and ex vivo co-culture systems.



 In our PDAC mouse models, tumor burden elicited a robust systemic inflammatory response marked by expansion of myeloid lineage cells, particularly MDSCs, within the TME, peripheral blood, and spleen. Tumor growth led to reduced frequencies and functional deficits in both endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in circulation and spleen. Depletion of Gr-1+ MDSCs effectively restored NK cell effector functions. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice promote NK cell dysfunction through induction of lipid peroxidation. Notably, we observed pronounced upregulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—a central lipid metabolism regulator—in MDSCs, which drove increased lipid oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Disruption of the ApoE-LDL receptor (LDLR) axis in MDSCs, achieved via genetic ablation, reprogrammed their metabolic activities and significantly reduced their immunosuppressive capacity toward both endogenous and transferred NK cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of lipid utilization rescued NK cell function and, when combined with NK cell adoptive transfer, produced synergistic anti-tumor effects in PDAC models.



 Our results emphasize the pivotal role of MDSC expansion in mediating systemic immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts. We identify the ApoE/LDLR axis as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt MDSC-driven immunosuppression, thereby enhancing the efficacy of NK cell–based immunotherapies. These findings underscore the importance of resolving systemic immune dysregulation in cancer patients to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Solid tumors often suppress antitumor immune responses by promoting various dysfunctional CD8+ T cell states, which limit the effectiveness of T-cell-based immunotherapy. However, the mechanisms that promote these states have not been fully characterized. It is demonstrated that spontaneous priming responses during tumor growth can produce memory T cell reservoirs that are conducive to poor proliferative responsiveness during boosting vaccination. Surprisingly, when type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is impeded, boosting vaccination can elicit robust proliferative responses from tumor-primed memory T cells and promote tumor control. This is observed in multiple tumor types and target antigens. In contrast to conventional memory T cells, tumor-primed memory T cells are unique in their pre-encoded responsiveness to IFN-I and show enrichment of pathways pertaining to DNA repair and cell cycle arrest. Tumor-primed memory T cells up-regulate p21 expression and blockade of either p21 or IFN-I can alleviate this effect to improve their proliferative capacity during boosting vaccination. Characterization of tumor-primed memory T cells revealed transcriptional and phenotypic features of cellular senescence, where higher senescence severity correlated with higher responsiveness to IFNα/β receptor blockade. Overall, IFN-I hyperresponsiveness may be a unique feature of senescent tumor-primed memory T cells that can exacerbate their dysfunction during cancer vaccination.">

This review comprehensively examines the immunosuppressive TME of RCC, emphasizing the roles of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive immune cells, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), abnormal vasculature, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in fostering immune evasion. This review summarized emerging biomarkers—including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene mutations, and immune-based subtypes—that may predict ICI response. Furthermore, we evaluate current immunotherapeutic strategies, such as ICIs, combination therapies, and novel approaches targeting immunosuppressive cells and metabolic pathways. While combination therapies have improved outcomes, challenges like toxicity and resistance persist, necessitating biomarker-driven patient stratification and optimized treatment sequencing. Future directions should focus on deciphering TME heterogeneity and developing precision immunotherapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy in RCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells represent a unique population of innate-like T lymphocytes capable of detecting non-peptide antigens in the context of monomorphic antigen-presenting molecules. Due to their abundance in barrier tissues, reactivity to local inflammatory cues, and cytotoxic and regulatory functions, MAIT cells are poised to shape the dynamics of various tumor microenvironments. Growing evidence suggests that MAIT cells can exert protumor and/or antitumor effects in cancers arising from or metastasizing to mucosal tissues. However, MAIT cell roles in bladder cancer (BCa) remains unclear. Methods To begin to identify MAIT cells in BCa, we stained bladder tumor biopsies for T cell receptor (TCR) Vα7.2+ cells. We then refined a human MAIT cell signature, which enabled us to interrogate a bulk RNA sequencing dataset and conduct correlation analyses linking intratumoral MAIT cell abundance and mortality from BCa. To extend our work to an in vivo setting, we employed a clinically relevant mouse model in which Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-sufficient) and Mr1−/− B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-deficient) mice were exposed to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine, a chemical carcinogen associated with tobacco smoke. In additional experiments, MAIT cells were functionally removed through acetyl-6-formylpterin (Ac-6-FP) administration. Effector and regulatory cell types were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and BCa tumor burden and progression were assessed by MRI and/or H&E and Ki67 staining. Results TCR Vα7.2+ cells were readily detectable in several BCa biopsies, and our bioinformatic analyses correlated heavier MAIT cell presence in BCa tumors with poorer overall survival. Similarly, we found higher tumor burdens in Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST mice than in Mr1−/− or Ac-6-FP-treated animals. Bladder MAIT cells from tumor-bearing mice exhibited phenotypic MAIT17 bias based on transcription factors they harbored along with increased interleukin-17A and tumor necrosis factor-α production capacities upon stimulation. Finally, FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cell frequencies were elevated in Mr1+/+ mouse bladder tumors, likely contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, a finding that could be recapitulated in our transcriptomic studies on human BCa. Conclusions MAIT cells are abundant in BCa tumor microenvironments where they potentiate Treg cell accumulation and play protumor roles.">

        <tr id="Success of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) is intricately influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex ecosystem that encompasses immune cells, stromal elements, and extracellular components. Despite the clinical breakthroughs of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, and other immunotherapeutic interventions, many patients fail to respond and eventually die. Emerging evidence points to cancer stem cells (CSCs) as critical drivers of immune evasion, therapy-resistance, and tumor relapse. CSCs modulate the TME by secreting immune-suppressive factors, recruiting regulatory immune cells, and inducing phenotype-switching of anti-tumor TME subsets, thereby creating a protective niche that hinders immune surveillance. Conversely, the TME protects CSCs through hypoxia, altered metabolism, and immuno-suppressive cell populations. This bi-directional crosstalk supports tumor progression and provides resistance to immunotherapeutic strategies mainly by: (i) escaping immune-recognition and inhibiting active T cells via high immune-checkpoint molecule expression, (ii) creating immunosuppressive pro-tumor environment, and (iii) evading immune-mediated apoptosis of CSCs along with therapy-induced enrichment of their pool. Targeting CSCs in concert with reprogramming the TME via CSC-directed agents, metabolic modulators, or combinatorial immunotherapies, therefore, offers a promising avenue to overcome immunotherapy-resistance and achieve durable clinical responses. This review discusses the deeper mechanistic understanding of CSC-TME interactions, in light of designing next-generation immunotherapies with broader efficacy across diverse tumor types.">

        <tr id="Oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) is a promising cancer immunotherapy that induces tumor cell lysis and stimulates anti-tumor immunity. Our previous single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of oHSV-treated medulloblastoma tumors revealed expansion and activation of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs), and direct oHSV infection of DCs within the brain. While the therapeutic effects of oHSVs have been primarily attributed to tumor cell infection, we hypothesize that direct infection of DCs also contributes to therapeutic efficacy by promoting DC maturation and immune activation. Although the oHSV infection in DCs was abortive, it led to increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/II and co-stimulatory molecules. oHSV-infected DCs activated naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, inducing expression of CD69 and CD25. These primed T cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against CT-2A glioma cells. Adoptive transfer of oHSV-infected DCs via subcutaneous injection near inguinal lymph nodes delayed tumor growth in a syngeneic CT-2A glioma model, independent of tumor viral replication and lysis. Mechanistically, our in vitro studies demonstrate that oHSV can directly infect and functionally activate DCs, enabling them to prime effective anti-tumor T cell responses. This study highlights the anti-tumor potential of leveraging oHSV-infected DCs to augment viroimmunotherapy as a cancer therapeutic.">

        <tr id="Melanoma frequently develops bone metastases, leading to skeletal-related events and poor survival. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in melanoma progression, bone metastasis, and immunotherapy resistance. Key immunosuppressive cells including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote immune evasion and osteolytic bone destruction via RANKL-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, have revolutionized melanoma treatment, yet resistance remains common due to TME immunosuppression. Emerging strategies, such as combination therapies, aim to enhance efficacy by reshaping the TME. This review synthesizes current knowledge on TME-driven immunosuppression, bone metastasis mechanisms, and immunotherapeutic advancements, offering insights into overcoming resistance and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Obesity is a rapidly growing public health crisis associated simultaneously with increased metabolic disease and humoral immune suppression to vaccination or infection. Inflammatory CD11c+T-bet+ B cells increase in spleen and adipose tissue during obesity and exacerbate metabolic dysfunction via antibodies. We now find that during obesity Tbet+ B cells also expand in the liver but not omentum or mesenteric fat. Obese mice also develop increased splenic CXCR5+ TFH and hepatic CXCR5- TPH cells which serve as likely partners for antigen-experienced MHC-II+ CD11c+ Tbet+ B cells. We also observed that antibodies in obese mice, previously found to contribute to metabolic disease, largely circulate as inflammatory autoantigen-bound immune complexes. Obese mice lacking T-bet in B cells also develop increased autoantibody titers and expanded splenic germinal center (GC) B and T helper cells. T-bet+ B cell-deficient mice make a similarly enhanced GC, TFH, TPH response to haptenated-protein vaccination with a corresponding increase in antibody affinity, although there is no additive effect of obesity. These results are consistent with GC inhibition by expanded CD11c+ B cells demonstrated by others to occur during autoimmunity, suggesting a broadly universal mechanism which may explain reduced humoral immunity and poor clinical outcomes following infection in patients with obesity and other forms of chronic inflammation.">

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects nearly one-fourth of the global population, yet effective diagnostics and treatments remain limited. Systemic immune dysregulation plays a key role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the value of immune profiling.


METHODS
In this study, we used high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n = 6), MASLD patients (n = 4), and MASLD patients treated with an 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) inhibitor (n = 2). PBMCs were stained with a 29-marker panel to identify 15 immune cell types and assess cytokine expression.


RESULTS
MASLD patients showed increased CD8⁺ T cells, early NK cells, and monocytes, along with reductions in TH2, TH1, late NK, and Treg cells. Cytokine profiling revealed elevated IL-6 expression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and late NK cells, indicating systemic inflammation. Automated clustering (PhenoGraph, UMAP) identified NK and phagocytic subsets associated with disease and treatment. Notably, 11β-HSD1 inhibition led to downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-6) and partial restoration of immune subsets.


CONCLUSIONS
These results offer a high-resolution view of immune alterations in MASLD and suggest that 11β-HSD1 inhibition may represent a promising immunomodulatory therapeutic strategy.">

High-resolution technologies, including single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have revealed the high heterogeneity, functional diversity, and spatial distribution within the CAF population. Significant differences exist in the interactions between distinct CAF subpopulations and immune cells. Through complex crosstalk with the immune system, they collaboratively establish an immunosuppressive network, becoming a core driving force for tumor immune escape.

 Fractionated focal radiation therapy (RT) induces immunogenic cell death and activates the type I interferon pathway via the cGAS/STING pathway, promoting tumor antigen cross-presentation by conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and driving tumor-specific T-cell activation. However, the impact of RT on tumor regression is often limited by its complex effects on the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME). Several studies have shown that RT increases both the frequency and functional activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), due in part to their intrinsic radioresistance and to RT-induced modulation of recruitment signals such as TGFβ, CCL17, and CCL221-2. In a recent study, we showed that RT combined with immunotherapy can remodel the TiME3, et persistent infiltration of activated Tregs can dampen the full immunostimulatory effects of RT-driven viral mimicry responses4. Here, we evaluated whether combining RT with blockade of the myeloid checkpoint SIRPα could modulate Treg infiltration and activity. Using mouse models of luminal (TSA) and triple-negative (AT3) breast cancer, we tested RT in combination with a blocking anti-SIRPα antibody (MY1; SIRPα-b). While MY1 monotherapy showed minimal activity, its combination with RT led to enhanced regression of irradiated tumors and inhibition of non-irradiated (abscopal) tumor growth in both tumor models. This effect was lost upon conditional cDC depletion using Zbtb46-DTR mice, highlighting the importance of cDCs in mediating the therapeutic synergy. To dissect the immune mechanisms underlying this synergy, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and CITE-seq on CD45+ tumor-infiltrating cells from TSA tumors treated with RT ± SIRPα-b. We observed a significant reduction in Treg infiltration in SIRPα-b–treated tumors, with or without RT. Furthermore, expression of Treg activation markers OX40, CTLA-4, and GITR was reduced, particularly in the RT + SIRPα-b group. Among infiltrating CD45+ cells, expression of Treg recruiting Ccl22 and Ccl17 chemokines was observed only in a highly activated cluster of CCR7high cDCs expressing SIRPα, CXCL16, PD-L1, and IL-15Rα. Notably, expression of both chemokines was strongly decreased following SIRPα-b treatment, suggesting that SIRPα signaling supports Treg recruitment via this cDC population.Studies to understand the mechanisms of Treg recruitment to the tumor via chemokine secretion by CCR7high cDCs and their role in tumor regression after RT + SIRPα-b are underway. Intra-tumoral CCR7high cDCs are known to support the activation and cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in the tumor through transpresentation of Il-155. Our results suggest that this population also plays a key immunoregulatory role in shaping the TiME. Targeting the CD47/SIRPα axis may thus improve RT efficacy by modulating the dual functions of CCR7high cDCs in both effector stimulation and Treg recruitment.

        <tr id="Sjögren’s disease (SjD) targets the salivary and lacrimal glands and is characterized by autoantibody production and glandular lymphocytic infiltrate with ectopic germinal centers (EGCs). The chemokine CCL25 recruits CCR9+ CD4+ T cells to the salivary glands to promote B cell activation. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting the CCL25–CCR9 axis to limit glandular inflammation and lymphoid neogenesis remains largely unexplored. Evaluate whether blocking the CCL25–CCR9+ T cell axis with a monoclonal antibody could reduce immune infiltration, ectopic germinal center (EGC) formation, and local autoantibody production in the NOD.H2(h4) mouse model of SjD. Female NOD.H2(h4) mice were administered anti-CCL25 antibody, isotype control, or PBS intraperitoneally for 12 weeks. Sera and saliva were collected to evaluate anti-Ro52 antibodies via ELISA across treatment groups. Salivary glands were harvested and processed for H&E staining to assess lymphocytic infiltration and focus scores. Treatment with α-CCL25 was well tolerated, with no significant differences in body weight or stimulated salivary flow between treatment groups. Histopathological evaluation revealed no reduction in lymphocytic infiltration, focus scores, or percentage of inflamed tissue in α-CCL25-treated mice compared to controls. Anti-Ro52 antibodies were undetectable in plasma or saliva across all groups and timepoints. Systemic CCL25 blockade did not significantly alter salivary gland inflammation, function, or autoantibody production in NOD.H2(h4) mice. These findings suggest that monotherapy targeting the CCL25–CCR9 axis may be insufficient to resolve glandular autoimmunity in this model and that additional or combinatorial strategies may be necessary for effective intervention.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematological malignancies but faces significant challenges in solid tumor therapy. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of solid tumors, including the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive factors, creates physical and biochemical barriers that hinder CAR-T cell infiltration, function, and persistence. Despite advances in CAR-T cell engineering, overcoming these TME barriers remains a major obstacle. The ECM in solid tumors restricts CAR-T cell penetration and limits their antitumor efficacy. Recent studies have explored ECM modulation as a strategy to enhance CAR-T therapy. Nattokinase (NKase), a natural fibrinolytic enzyme, has shown potential in degrading ECM components, promoting TME remodeling, and improving therapeutic responses. In this study, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of NKase in combination with MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells for solid tumors. We hypothesize that NKase will reduce tumor fibrosis by degrading ECM components, facilitating CAR-T cell infiltration and enhancing their cytotoxic activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments will assess the effects of NKase on CAR-T cell infiltration, activation, memory phenotype maintenance, and antitumor activity. This study aims to optimize CAR-T therapy for solid tumors and supports the clinical potential of NKase as an adjunctive therapeutic agent.

        <tr id="Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal yet paradoxical roles of innate immune cells and their associated cytokines in orchestrating the dynamic landscape of the breast tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Innate immune effectors, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and natural killer (NK) cells, exert dual functions by either initiating robust antitumor responses or facilitating immune evasion, metastatic dissemination, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, MDSCs suppress T and NK cell activity via STAT3/NF-κB signaling and modulate the cytokine milieu through IL-10 and TGF-β. Similarly, M2-polarized TAMs promote angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance via IL-10/STAT3/Bcl-2 pathways. In contrast, NK cells and CD103+ DCs mediate tumor cell cytolysis and prime antigen-specific immunity, though their activity is frequently compromised in advanced disease. Moreover, key cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β, and CCL2/5, demonstrate subtype-specific and context-dependent effects, acting as both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing agents through complex signaling networks. This review highlights the dualistic nature of innate immune components in breast cancer, discusses their prognostic and therapeutic implications, and proposes novel intervention strategies, such as TAM repolarization, and cytokine modulation, to reprogram the TIME and restore effective immune surveillance, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a kind of plasma cell hematologic malignancy. Notable advancements in patient survival have been achieved due to the clinical application of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) and bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs). However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the bone marrow hinders the effectiveness of these novel immunotherapies, consequently restricting their efficacy. Hence, it is imperative to clarify the exact mechanisms to devise strategies aimed at improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of recent research concerning the different T cell subtypes in the immune evasion mechanisms of MM. The review emphasizes the imbalance between the immune surveillance and the immune suppression, and highlight recent studies about unconventional T cells, the metabolic control of immune reactions, and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing immune evasion mechanisms that promote the progression of MM.">

        <tr id="Introduction Kidney transplant rejections are classified as active antibody mediated rejection (AMR) and cell mediated rejection (TCMR), with AMR primarily driven by antibodies produced by B cells, whereas TCMR is mediated by T lymphocytes that orchestrate cellular immune responses against the graft. Emerging evidence highlights the essential roles of innate immune cells in rejections, especially monocytes/macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. However, the roles of specific innate immune cell subpopulations in kidney allograft rejection remain incompletely understood. Methods We performed the spatial transcriptomics using the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) core needle biopsies from human kidney allografts. Results We demonstrated that non-rejection, AMR, acute TCMR and chronic active AMR have distinct transcriptomic features. Subclusters of monocytes/macrophages with high Fc gamma receptor IIIA (FCGR3A) expression were identified in C4d-positive active AMR and acute TCMR, and the spatial distribution of these cells corresponded to the characteristic histopathological features. Key markers related to monocyte/macrophage activation and innate alloantigen recognition were upregulated, along with metabolic pathways associated with trained immunity in AMR and TCMR. Discussion Taking together, these findings revealed that intragraft monocytes/macrophages with high FCGR3A expression play a critical role in kidney transplant rejections.">

 Glioblastoma, the most common and lethal primary brain tumor, creates profound immunosuppression that has resisted clinical interventions. The mechanisms behind immunotherapy failures in glioblastoma remain unclear. We conducted a systematic comparison of different immunotherapeutic approaches in mouse models to better understand treatment responses.



 Using multiomic single-cell analysis and spatial profiling, we evaluated GL261 glioma-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-L1 antibodies, NKG2D-CAR-expressing T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, or macrophages.



 All treatment models induced immune cell migration through chemotaxis. Additionally, PD-L1 and CAR T cell treatments led to an exhaustion-associated T cell signature alongside increased cytotoxic T cell presence. Further, we observed higher numbers of immunomodulatory lymphocytes and macrophages associated with these two immunotherapies. CAR macrophages and CAR NK cells exhibited enhanced cytotoxic gene signatures without increasing T cell numbers. Also, the immunomodulatory macrophage response appeared attenuated in CAR NK cells and macrophages. Notably, CAR NK cells demonstrated an enhanced antiviral response with interferon-beta expression that was not observed in other models.



 While PD-L1 and CAR cell treatments successfully polarized the lymphoid compartment toward cytotoxic phenotypes, these approaches alone appear insufficient as they were accompanied by pronounced immunomodulatory cell responses. CAR NK cells and macrophages were characterized by attenuated immunomodulatory responses. Our findings suggest that cytotoxic lymphocytes alone fail to override tumor-associated immune suppression. This is in line with recent evidence on T helper cell roles in CAR therapy. Future immunotherapy approaches should balance cytotoxic and helper lymphocyte populations while enhancing inflammatory macrophages to overcome the immunosuppressive environment of glioblastoma

        <tr id="Simple Summary Donor lymphocyte infusion is a type of immune therapy that helps control leukemia after a stem cell transplant, but it often comes with the serious side effect of graft-versus-host disease, where the donated immune cells attack the patient’s healthy tissues. Exercise has long been known to improve cancer treatment responses and reduce side effects, but its role in this type of therapy has not been well studied. In this research, we tested whether voluntary running could influence the benefits and risks of donor lymphocyte infusion in mice. All mice received leukemia cells, and some were given immune cells from healthy donors. Half of the mice had access to a running wheel, while the others remained sedentary. We found that exercise reduced the severity of graft-versus-host disease, extended survival, and slowed tumor growth. Mice that exercised lived longer and had fewer cancer cells compared to those that did not exercise. Additional analyses suggested that exercise changed how leukemia cells used energy, which may have contributed to these benefits. These findings highlight the potential of exercise to make immune therapies for leukemia more effective and safer for patients.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the most prevalent and lethal form of lung cancer worldwide. Among the diverse components of the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of NSCLC progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. TAMs, particularly those polarized toward the M2-like phenotype, facilitate tumor growth through immunosuppression, angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling. They promote immune evasion via PD-L1, IL-10, and TGF-β signaling, and confer chemoresistance through activation of the IL-6/STAT3 and P2X7/STAT6 pathways. Moreover, high infiltration of M2-TAMs and their expression of immune checkpoint ligands have been associated with poor prognosis and, paradoxically, with improved response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in certain patients. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram TAM phenotypes, inhibit their recruitment, or selectively suppress their immunosuppressive functions. However, challenges such as macrophage plasticity, lack of specific biomarkers, and potential systemic toxicity remain significant barriers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological functions, mechanistic roles, and clinical implications of TAMs in NSCLC, highlighting both their value as prognostic indicators and their potential as therapeutic targets in the era of precision oncology.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer and there is mounting evidence that the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a role in the pathogenesis of haematologic malignancies as well as treatment resistance. Macrophages play a central role in anti-tumor immunity, and dysregulation of macrophage mediated phagocytosis has recently emerged as a key player in blood cancers. The integrin associated protein CD47 is expressed in a variety of cancers and interacts with its ligand, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) expressed on macrophages, resulting in down regulation of macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is highly expressed in various cancers including multiple myeloma (MM). It is therefore postulated that blockade of the CD47-SIRPα immune checkpoint has the potential to ‘re-awaken’ macrophage mediated phagocytosis of MM plasma cells. In this review, we provide our perspective on the key pre-clinical data supporting the CD47-SIRPα axis as a therapeutic target in MM. We subsequently discuss the ongoing clinical trials which may provide the basis for future clinical translation of these agents. We also highlight key gaps in our knowledge of macrophage biology in MM which need to be addressed by future research. Finally, we present potential future directions for translational research and personalized application of macrophage-based immunotherapy in MM.

Consequently, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become the primary driver of chronic liver disease globally and is currently the most rapidly accelerating factor contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, current evidence indicates that immunotherapy, a cornerstone of HCC management, yields suboptimal results specifically in MASLD-related HCC (MASLD-HCC) cases. Various immune components constitute a special immune microenvironment in MASLD-HCC, including heterogeneous myeloid cells, lymphocytes and platelets. Furthermore, disruptions in the intestinal barrier, along with the ectopic presence of intestinal flora and metabolites, also influence the immune microenvironment in MASLD-HCC. Elucidating immune cells functions and their interplay with gut microbiota is critical to deciphering MASLD progression to carcinogenesis and immunotherapy resistance.

 Despite the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), therapeutic resistance and the unpredictable development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) remain major challenges. While the use of ICIs in combination can improve treatment efficacy, this also leads to an increase in the frequency and severity of irAEs. This has created an urgent need to enhance anti-tumor immunity without triggering immunotoxicity. However, current preclinical models are limited in their ability to model both ICI efficacy and irAE development. This is due to mouse strains commonly used for studying anti-tumor immunity, such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, being resistant to ICI-induced irAEs and failing to recapitulate the full spectrum of clinical responses seen in patients with cancer. To overcome these limitations, we generated transplantable, syngeneic tumor models with variable ICI responses using the autoimmune-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. The NOD model, which spontaneously develops multiple autoimmune diseases, exhibits a broad range of irAEs following ICI treatment with a shared etiology to clinical conditions. This approach offers insight into how genetic predisposition to autoimmunity influences both ICI response and irAE susceptibility, enabling us to explore how autoimmune-associated host-intrinsic factors uniquely alter the tumor microenvironment and contribute to ICI resistance. In ICI-resistant NOD tumors, CD8+ T cells exhibited a naïve-like phenotype, marked by elevated TCF-1 and reduced PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression, compared to ICI-sensitive tumors. Despite comparable CD8+ T cell frequency and number, these phenotypic differences led us to investigate other immune cell populations that regulate ICI response and CD8+ T cell activation. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry revealed enrichment of immunosuppressive γδ T cells in ICI-resistant tumors. These γδ T cells highly expressed the transcription factors RORγt+ and TCF1+ and lacked expression of T-bet and the mouse Vγ1 TCR chain, suggesting that distinct γδ T cell subsets may play different roles in tumor control. Functionally, antibody-mediated blockade of the γδ T cell receptor (γδTCR) significantly improved tumor control in ICI-resistant, but not ICI-sensitive, models, implicating γδ T cells in promoting tumor growth. Tumors enriched with immunosuppressive RORγt+ and TCF1+ γδ T cells also exhibited increased B cell infiltration. In B cell-deficient NOD mice, γδ T cells skewed toward T-bet and Vγ1 expression, which correlated with enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. These findings reveal a coordinated immunosuppressive network between γδ T cells and B cells that limits anti-tumor immunity. Given their roles in promoting autoimmunity, these cell types may represent therapeutic targets to boost anti-tumor immunity and overcome ICI resistance without exacerbating irAEs.

        <tr id="B7 homolog 3 (B7-H3, CD276) has emerged as a promising target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, with limited expression in normal tissues and high level cell-surface expression across various tumor types. Clinical studies are ongoing, with a focus on pediatric cancers. As an immune checkpoint molecule of the B7-CD28 family, B7-H3 has a proposed immune-modulatory role, though the precise nature of B7-H3-mediated cell interactions and functional contributions to immune responses are contradictory and likely context-dependent. Within tumors, B7-H3 is expressed also on non-tumor cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including myeloid immune cells, endothelial cells of abnormal vasculature and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Consequently, CAR T cells directed against B7-H3 will not only target tumor cells but also components of the TME, which will affect the nature and outcome of B7-H3-targeted therapeutic immune responses. Here we review the expression of B7-H3 protein in pediatric solid tumors and in various cell types known to infiltrate the TME of solid tumors. On this background, we discuss the potential of B7-H3-targeted CAR T cells to reshape the TME and the key challenges and future directions to improve B7-H3-targeted CAR T cell therapy for pediatric patients with solid cancers.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer is a significant global health issue with inflammation emerging as a critical driver of progression. The prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) is comprised of tumor cells, mesenchymal stem cells, immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, adipocytes, and the extracellular matrix. All of these TME components interact via soluble factors, such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. These interactions remodel the TME and drive inflammation and tumor progression. Prolonged inflammation leads to dysregulated activation and infiltration of immune cells in the TME. This process maintains an immunosuppressive environment and facilitates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion. Chronic inflammation causes inflammatory mediators to enter the circulation over time, as evidenced by systemic biomarkers, such as the systemic immune-inflammation index, which links inflammation to disease severity. Interactions between the prostate gland and adipose tissues further exacerbate systemic inflammation. Inflammation in the prostate gland confers resistance to therapy, primes distant metastatic niches, and promotes metastatic spread, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Therapeutic strategies, such as anti-inflammatory agents and immunotherapies, hold promise in mitigating disease burden. This review explored the immune landscape of systemic inflammation in prostate cancer, discussed the role of the immune landscape in resistance to therapy and metastasis, and offered insights into potential interventions for targeting inflammation to limit prostate cancer burden.">

        <tr id="Background The immunosuppressive microenvironment and limited immune cell infiltration into the tumor bed contribute to the proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of breast cancer (BC) cells. Reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for BC, but remains challenging in clinical practice. Artemisia annua, a medicinal plant, has shown immune-enhancing and anti-tumor activities, although its potential therapeutic applications in BC remain underexplored. Methods Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from fresh Artemisia annua using gradient centrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Zetasizer Nano ZS90, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was performed to investigate the mechanism of AEVs on tumor growth in vivo and mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) was employed to further explore the mechanism of AEVs-induced polarization shift from M2-like to M1-like macrophages. In vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to assess the polarization of macrophages and recruitment of T lymphocytes into the tumor bed. Results AEVs were successfully isolated and characterized. In vivo, AEVs inhibited tumor growth by shifting macrophage polarization from the M2-like to the M1-like phenotype, and synergistically enhancing the recruitment of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment. AEVs activated the NF-κB signaling pathway while inhibiting the PPARγ pathway, thereby promoting the M1-like polarization of macrophages. Polarized M1-like macrophages secreted chemokines (CCL5 and CCL3), which facilitated T lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor bed. Notably, AEVs reshaped the BC immune microenvironment without inducing systemic toxicity. Conclusions AEVs from Artemisia annua efficiently reprogrammed the immune microenvironment of breast cancer by inducing macrophage polarization and enhancing T lymphocyte infiltration. This study lays the foundation for using AEVs as a potential immunotherapy for BC and highlights the medicinal value of Artemisia annua in cancer treatment.

        <tr id="VEXAS (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory, Somatic) syndrome is a haemato-rheumatoid disease caused by somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The pathogenic cell type(s) responsible for the syndrome are unknown and murine models recapitulating the disease are lacking. We report that loss of Uba1 in various mouse hematopoietic cell types resulted in pleiotropic consequences and demonstrate that murine mutants with about 70% loss of Uba1 in neutrophils induced non-lethal VEXAS-like symptoms. Depletion of Uba1 in HSCs induced extensive hematopoietic cell loss while depletion of Uba1 in B or T cells, or in megakaryocytes induced corresponsive cell death but these mutants appeared normal. Depletion of Uba1 in monocytes and neutrophils failed to induce cell death and the mutants were viable. Among the tested models, only depletion of Uba1 in neutrophils induced autoinflammatory symptoms including increased counts and percentage of neutrophils, increased proinflammatory cytokines, occurrence of vacuoles in myeloid cells, splenomegaly and dermatitis. Residual Uba1 was about 30% in the mutant neutrophils, which disrupted cellular hemostasis. Finally, genetic loss of the myeloid pro-survival regulator Morrbid partially mitigated the VEXAS-like symptoms. The established VEXAS-like murine model will assist understanding and treatment of the newly identified autoinflammatory syndrome prevalent among aged men.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with its progression shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic factors but also by a complex and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Within this niche, diverse immune populations—including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cell subsets (Th1, Th17, Tregs), B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—collectively regulate immune surveillance and tumor escape. While effector lymphocytes mediate antitumor responses, their function is often attenuated by TAM- and MDSC-driven immunosuppression via cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), metabolic disruption, and immune checkpoint expression. High densities of M2-polarized TAMs and MDSCs correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have improved outcomes in lung cancer, yet therapeutic efficacy remains limited by the immunosuppressive TME. This review outlines the functional roles of key immune cell subsets in lung cancer and highlights emerging strategies to reprogram the TME and enhance immunotherapeutic responsiveness.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has transformed the landscape of cancer treatment, offering hope to patients who were once considered beyond the reach of effective care. However, its success is restricted to a limited fraction of patients. This discrepancy in response is largely due to the complex and dynamic nature of the tumor immune-microenvironment. At the heart of this complexity is the concept of cancer immunoediting—a dynamic process through which the immune system both sculpts and is shaped by the tumor. This process unfolds in three key stages: Elimination, Equilibrium, and Escape, each representing a shifting balance between immune defenses and tumor adaptation. Central to this interaction are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TILs are frontline defenders in targeting tumor cells, while TAMs can either hinder or facilitate tumor growth based on their polarization. As cancer progresses, immune selection pressure induces phenotypic alterations that promote immune evasion, fostering an environment detrimental to effective immune response. This review explores the role of these immunological components in each phase of immunoediting and their impact on the efficacy or failure of immunotherapy. Gaining deeper insight into these interactions is crucial for developing advanced immunotherapies that reshape tumor microenvironment and expand the reach of immunotherapy to more patients.">

        <tr id="Pathogen-associated cancers account roughly 15–20% of all malignancies worldwide and arise from chronic infections by oncogenic viruses, bacteria and parasites. Pathogens can alter the tumor microenvironment (TME) into an immune-suppressive niche using multiple mechanisms, including immune checkpoint manipulation, chronic inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, and direct epigenetic modifications. Immune dysfunctions related to infections linked to cancers can include M2-polarized macrophages, expansion of MDSCs, exhausted T/NK cells, and tolerogenic dendritic cells, all progressing immune evasion and resistance to cancer therapy. Advances in therapeutics exist in prophylactic vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and next-generation methods such as the engineered Salmonella to deliver to hypoxic tumors and the targeting the microbiome. The advancement of pathogen-, cancer-, and patient-specific therapeutics is not without its challenges, including heterogeneity of the pathogens, absence of clinically useful biomarkers, concerns about the safety of the restoring anti-pathogen immunity and challenges of scale for manifold interventions. This review will provide a synthesis of the mechanistic aspects of pathogen-mediated TME remodeling, contemporary clinical therapeutics, and ongoing investigations into using pathogen/host dynamics to enhance measurable precision immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are central to tumor progression, immune suppression, and resistance to therapy, making them promising targets in cancer immunotherapy. TAMs exhibit functional heterogeneity, polarizing into pro-tumor (M2-like) and anti-tumor (M1-like) phenotypes under different microenvironmental cues. M2-like TAMs promote immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, while M1-like TAMs enhance antitumor immunity. Combining TAM-targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors is also emerging as a potential strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. This review outlines TAM-mediated immunosuppression mechanisms, including the secretion of VEGF, TGF-β, and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-L1. We also summarize the current strategies targeting TAMs, such as blocking the CD47/SIRPα axis, using CD40 agonists, and PI3Kγ inhibitors, which have shown promise in preclinical studies. Overall, this review underscores TAMs as pivotal therapeutic targets and proposes future directions to optimize combinatorial immunotherapy for enhanced clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Dual immune checkpoint blockade (IO/IO) has significantly improved overall survival in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but only ∼50% of patients initially respond to treatment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying primary response and resistance is critical to improving therapeutic outcomes. Methods We developed a novel mouse model of sarcomatoid RCC (sRCC) by targeting Vhl, Bap1, and Cdkn2a/b, recapitulating the genomic and histological features and tumor microenvironment of human sRCC. Mice were treated with anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Tumor-infiltrating immune populations were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry to evaluate T cell subsets and cytotoxic function. Results Anti-CTLA-4 treatment led to Treg depletion and an increase in activated Th1 cells. Importantly, only responder mice exhibited a selective expansion of TCF1+ CD4+ T cells. This was accompanied by increased granzyme B and perforin expression in effector CD8+ T cells, indicating enhanced cytotoxic activity. In contrast, non-responder mice lacked this TCF1+ CD4+ population and associated cytotoxic CD8+ responses. Conclusions Our findings reveal that Treg-depleting anti-CTLA-4 therapy promotes anti-tumor immunity by expanding a TCF1+ CD4+ T cell population that orchestrates CD8+ T cell responses. This mechanism offers a novel insight into immune modulation in sRCC and identifies a potential target to improve immunotherapy efficacy in RCC patients.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous myeloid clonal disorders derived from hematopoietic stem cells. The incidence of MDS (1.51/100,000 in China, 4-5/100,000 in Europe and America) is higher than any subtype of leukemia. In recent years, the imbalance of immune regulation and tumor microenvironmental disorders have received increasing attention in the pathogenesis of MDS. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein 3 (TIM-3) is an important inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule, widely expressed in T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages and other immune cells. Numerous studies have confirmed that TIM-3 is aberrantly expressed in a variety of solid and hematologic tumors and plays an important role in regulating tumor escape and immune depletion. In this paper, we focus on reviewing the relevant studies of TIM-3 in MDS and summarize the findings of our team in this field. We also discuss the potential application of TIM-3 in the diagnosis and treatment of MDS in conjunction with the latest clinical trials. Blocking TIM-3 has both ‘tumor cell-targeted inhibition’ and ‘immune function remodeling’ dual roles in MDS disease progression, which provides new therapeutic strategies and hope for MDS patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells are pivotal effectors in innate antitumor immunity by mediating cytotoxicity, secreting cytokines, or expressing cell membrane receptors, which facilitate interactions with other immune cells. The cytotoxic activity and immune function of NK cells are governed by dynamic receptor–ligand interactions, cytokine networks, and metabolic–epigenetic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent years, NK cell‐based therapies are emerging as a promising clinical approach for antitumor treatment, owing to their rapid response, unique recognition mechanisms, potent cytotoxic capabilities, and memory‐like characteristics, along with their low risk of posttreatment adverse effects and cost effectiveness. However, immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming driven by TME subvert NK cell surveillance, impairing its antitumor function. This review comprehensively details molecular mechanisms underpinning NK cell dysfunction, including dysregulated activating/inhibitory receptor signaling, metabolic reprogramming, and epigenetic silencing of effector genes. We further synthesize advances in clinical strategies to restore NK cytotoxicity including ex vivo expansion for adoptive transfer, chimeric antigen receptor‐NK engineering, TME‐remodeling agents, immune checkpoint blockade, cytokine‐based therapies, and NK cell engagers targeting tumor antigens. By bridging mechanistic insights with translational applications, this work provides a framework for rationally designed NK cell‐based immunotherapies to overcome resistance across solid and hematologic malignancies.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T lymphocytes are central effectors of anticancer immunity. Their abundance and spatial distribution within solid tumors are strongly correlated with patient prognosis and response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Tumors have been categorized into “hot,” “excluded,” and “cold” types based on the infiltration patterns of CD8+ T cells, which reflect the underlying immune contexture and therapeutic potential. However, many tumors remain resistant to T-cell infiltration, posing a significant barrier to immunotherapy. This review systematically outlines the seven critical steps of the Cancer-Immunity Cycle that govern CD8+ T-cell infiltration: antigen release, antigen processing and presentation, T-cell priming, trafficking through the vasculature, tumor infiltration, target recognition, and cytolytic activity. At each step, tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental barriers—including low tumor mutational burden, defective antigen-presenting machinery, immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-β, IL-10), abnormal vasculature, fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix, and inhibitory cell populations (e.g., Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs)—can stall the immune response. We further discuss the roles of immune-checkpoint signaling, metabolic competition, and suppressive cell networks in shaping T-cell exhaustion and exclusion. Cutting-edge technologies—such as single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, imaging mass cytometry, and TCR repertoire profiling—have revealed spatial and functional heterogeneity within intratumoral CD8+ T cells and informed the design of rational combination therapies. Understanding and targeting these barriers is critical for converting immune-cold tumors into immune-infiltrated, therapy-responsive states. We conclude with a perspective on the future of immunoengineering and immune-atlas integration to optimize CD8+ T-cell–based interventions in solid tumors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Sepsis, caused by an unbalanced host response to infection, remains a global health burden. The dysregulation between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is a primary driver of immune imbalance. As a central player in adaptive immunity, CD4+ T cells are crucial for maintaining this balance during sepsis by differentiating into various effector T cell subsets. Thus, elucidating the underlying mechanisms within the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis is of great value. We first identified the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) as a significantly upregulated gene in CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients by conducting a comprehensive transcriptome meta-analysis. The expression of PIM1 was significantly elevated on CD4+ T cells from sepsis patients and was correlated with both SOFA and APACHE II scores. Moreover, we found that PIM1 promoted the differentiation of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 subsets while inhibiting the differentiation of CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. Additionally, upon inhibiting PIM1 kinase activity in CD4+ T cells, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the cholesterol metabolism gene, ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), exhibited significant upregulation. More importantly, we found that the intracellular cholesterol content was decreased in CD4+ T cells after inhibiting the PIM1 kinase activity or knocking down PIM1. The portion of CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 and CD4+IL-17A+ Th17 cells was recovered, and the CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs decreased after cholesterol supplementation to CD4+ T cells. These findings indicated that PIM1 may regulate the balance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets in a cholesterol-dependent manner in sepsis. IMPORTANCE This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance of CD4+ T cell subsets during sepsis. Our study provides evidence that PIM1 serves as a crucial regulator of sepsis-induced inflammation and elucidates that PIM1 participates in regulating the imbalance of Th1, Th17, and Treg subsets, further promoting inflammatory and anti-inflammatory imbalance in sepsis. Additionally, the cholesterol metabolism, potentially mediated by ABCG1, is implicated in PIM1’s regulatory effect on the Th1, Th17, and Treg imbalance. Our study provides novel insights into the inflammatory imbalance during sepsis, which could facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the immune-inflammatory cascade in this condition.">

        <tr id="Identifying factors that mediate successful anticancer immune responses is necessary to improve outcomes for patients with advanced cancers. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on mouse melanomas experiencing successful and unsuccessful immune responses and discovered a prominent ferroptosis signature in tumors undergoing immune-mediated regression. Pairing ferroptosis inducers and inhibitors with immunotherapies ex vivo and in vivo highlighted a central role for ferroptosis in stimulating the anti-melanoma immune response. In co-culture models, CD8+ T cells drove melanoma cell ferroptosis by altering the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a crucial antioxidant enzyme known for its role in preventing lipid peroxidation. Direct contact between tumor cells and CD8+ T cells was needed to sustain GPX4 downregulation over time, resulting in ferroptotic cell death. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data from human melanoma tumors responding to immunotherapy revealed a ferroptosis signature that mirrors the mouse model. Together, these results offer crucial insights into the role of ferroptosis in antitumor immunity and highlight the potential of modulating ferroptosis to enhance immunotherapy responses.">

 Despite recent advances in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) biology and new therapies, this aggressive subtype remains difficult to treat. A key obstacle is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), often dominated by myeloid cells that impair anti-tumor immunity. Radiation therapy (RT), used as an in-situ vaccine, enhances tumor immunogenicity and has shown promise when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical and clinical settings1-3. We previously found that combining RT with CTLA-4 blockade and a CD40 agonist antibody (CD40a), which activates myeloid cells, led to profound tumor regression and occasional complete responses in a rapidly metastasizing TNBC mouse model4. However, CD40a did not improve control of lung metastases beyond that achieved with RT and CTLA-4 blockade. In tumors, CD40a induced remodeling of dendritic cell and macrophage populations, along with enrichment in B cell–associated gene signatures. As CD40 signaling can promote either effector or regulatory B cell responses depending on context5, we hypothesized that triple therapy induces organ-specific B cell differentiation that may hinder systemic immune control. We first assessed systemic versus local effects of CD40a on B cells in naïve and tumor-bearing (4T1) mice. In both settings, CD40a expanded splenic B cells and increased MHC-II+ expression. In lungs, tumor implantation alone led to increased B cell infiltration, even without CD40a. However, these lung B cells showed reduced activation in untreated tumor-bearing mice, only partially restored by CD40a, suggesting a distinct, potentially immunosuppressive phenotype. To evaluate this in the context of RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a, we analyzed B cells from lungs and tumors via multiparametric flow cytometry and observed that CD40a consistently shifted B cell profiles across compartments. Among B cells, we identified regulatory B cells (Breg) as expressing TIM1, CD138, CD5, CD39, and FasL. CD40a decreased Breg infiltration in tumors but significantly increased it in lungs. In both tissues, Breg marker expression correlated with tumor or lung burden. Given TIM1’s role in IL-10–producing Bregs—and its capacity to suppress T cells independently of IL-10—6-8 we tested a TIM1-blocking antibody in combination with RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a. While TIM1 blockade did not enhance tumor control, it markedly reduced lung Bregs. Our data highlight organ-specific B cell responses following CD40a-based immunotherapy and suggest that lung-resident Bregs may limit systemic immune efficacy. Ongoing work focuses on defining mechanisms of Breg-mediated suppression and, in collaboration with bioengineers, on developing intra-tumoral delivery strategies to reduce systemic immunosuppressive effects of agents like CD40a. 1-PMID: 29180535 2-PMID: 33476307 3-PMID: 30397353 4-PMID: 37620372 5-PMID: 19265127 6-PMID: 25582854 7-PMID: 31511630 8-PMID: 31685302

        <tr id="Background The programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1 or PD-1) is a key regulatory immune checkpoint and a major target for therapeutic intervention. In oncology, antibodies blocking the PD-1 pathway are used to activate immune cells to promote anti tumour immunity while in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, PD-1 agonist molecules have the potential to achieve immune suppression. NK cells are a specialised population of innate lymphocytes able to recognize a large range of distressed cells including damaged tissues in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Of note, NK cells can upregulate PD-1 expression upon activation and their effector functions can be modulated by the PD-1 signalling pathway. Methods We have generated a novel bispecific inhibitory molecule, comprised of a targeting domain highly specific for a pre-pro-insulin peptide presented by the HLA-A*02 molecules on the cell surface of pancreatic β-cells and a PD-1 agonist effector domain. Suppressive effects of the β-cell tethered bispecific PD-1 agonist molecule on NK cells and NK92-PD-1 cell line activation were assessed through gene expression, cell surface expression of the CD107a degranulation marker, intracellular IFNγ production and Granzyme B secretion. EndoC-b cells proliferation and insulin production were also measured. Results We observed that the bispecific PD-1 agonist molecules tethered to pancreatic b-cells accumulate at the immunological synapse, modify NK cell gene expression and decrease their inflammatory and cytotoxic functions. Conclusions Targeted PD-1 agonist molecules, inhibiting T cells and NK cells in a tissue-specific manner offer a new promising treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.">

 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are major negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Identifying tumor secreting factors and signaling pathways that enhance their pro-tumorigenic activity could lead to new strategies to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. We have identified tumor-secreted epidermal growth factor-like 6 (EGFL6) as a new mediator of tumor immune suppression. In-vitro and ex-vivo analyses indicated that EGFL6 binds beta integrins to activate spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling, functioning as (i) a chemotactic factor for myeloid cell migration and (ii) a driver of their differentiation into immunosuppressive phenotypes. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer, EGFL6 expression promoted intra-tumoral accumulation of MDSCs and TAMs with high SYK, CXCL2, and IL-10 expression. In an immune ‘hot’ tumor model, EGFL6 completely abrogated the response to anti-PD-L1 therapy, whereas Egfl6 neutralization decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and MDSCs and thereby restored the efficacy of a-PD-L1 therapy. Spatial transcriptomic datasets of human ovarian cancer tissues revealed strong correlation between tumor EGFL6 and myeloid cell SYK expression. Dual immunohistochemistry confirmed increased SYK+ macrophages in ovarian cancer compared to normal ovary. We therefore tested whether SYK inhibition could hinder EGFL6-induced signaling in myeloid cells and reprogram them from an immunosuppressive to an immunostimulatory phenotype. Treatment with the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (R788) prolonged survival in Egfl6+/- ID8p53-/- tumor-bearing mice, reduced the number of intra-tumoral granulocytic MDSCs, and decreased VEGF, M-CSF, and CXCL5 levels in ascites. scRNA-seq revealed that SYK inhibition depleted specific CCL8+ TAM and CXCL2+ MDSC subsets, induced immunostimulatory myeloid cell populations, and reduced exhausted of TIGIT+CTL4+ CD8 T cells. These findings demonstrate that targeting the EGFL6-SYK axis, via EGFL6 blockade or SYK inhibition, can reprogram the ovarian tumor microenvironment to enhance anti-tumor immunity and restore responsiveness of “cold” tumors to immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by rapid proliferation and infiltration of immune cells into tumor microenvironment (TME). The treatment of TNBC still remains challenging due to the lack of expression of effective molecular targets pertaining to the tumor cell itself. In TNBC standard of care, therapies such as chemotherapy, together with recently introduced immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, often do not result in durable clinical response. Therefore, better understanding of complex interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells mediated by multiple cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and metabolites in TME is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that underlie tumor cell immune evasion strategies. The aim of this review is to give comprehensive overview of immune cell network and their interactions with cells in TME and possibilities for therapeutic targeting of TME in TNBC. We discuss cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as an important recently characterized player in TNBC with respect to their role in interactions with immune cells and their impact on tumor invasion. Based on the recently accumulated knowledge, therapies targeting immune suppressive mechanisms and CAF-related tumor-promoting mechanisms in TME hold great potential for clinical evaluation in TNBC.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a multifaceted and heterogeneous disease characterized by uncontrolled growth, evasion of immune surveillance, and resistance to conventional therapies. The immune system plays a crucial role in tumor surveillance. However, tumors exploit immune checkpoint pathways to inhibit T cell activation and evade immune destruction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have markedly improved outcomes in certain cancers by restoring T cell function and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Despite these advances, the presence of immune resistance mechanisms contributes to variability in responses and ongoing challenges in overcoming resistance. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), compared to other breast cancer (BC) subtypes, exhibits higher immunogenicity, but its anti-tumor immunity is profoundly suppressed by immune checkpoint molecules, creating a paradoxical scenario of “high immunogenic potential yet restrained by inhibitory signals”. Consequently, TNBC has become a significant target for ICI therapy. However, response rates vary among BC subtypes, with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) BC demonstrating lower immunogenicity. Hematological malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, also exhibit distinct immune checkpoint dynamics, influencing their responsiveness to ICIs. This review comprehensively examines the mechanisms of immune checkpoint regulation, their role in cancer immune evasion, and the clinical applications of ICIs in both solid and hematological malignancies. It further discusses emerging strategies to counteract ICI resistance, such as dual checkpoint blockade, tumor microenvironment modulation, metabolic targeting, and epigenetic reprogramming. An enhanced understanding of immune checkpoint biology is essential for optimizing immunotherapy strategies and improving patient outcomes. The literature selection for this study was guided by relevance to the research topic, focusing on peer-reviewed articles, monographs, and conference proceedings published between 2010 and 2025, sourced from databases like PubMed and Google Scholar.">

        <tr id="Over the past 30 years, work of immunologists worldwide has phenotypically and functionally defined “Natural Killer T cells” (NKT) and their subsets, including “invariant Natural Killer T cells” (iNKT). NKT cells make up a substantial fraction of T cells that express NK cell markers and have TCRs restricted to either conventional MHC molecules or the monomorphic CD1d molecule. Among these, iNKT cells are CD1d-restricted and more common within NKT cells than T cells without NK markers. While the definition of NKT cells, whether based on phenotype, function, or both, remains a topic of debate, iNKT cells represent a distinct T cell population characterized by a recurrent, conserved TCR rearrangement (TRAV10–TRAJ18 in humans) paired with a limited Vβ repertoire (mostly encoded by TRBV25-1 in humans). iNKT cells are restricted by CD1d, which, unlike CD1a-c molecules, is expressed not only on professional antigen-presenting cells and thymocytes but also on certain non-hematopoietic somatic tissues, both normal and neoplastic. Like all CD1 family members, CD1d presents various lipid antigens by accommodating their long hydrophobic tails in deep binding pockets, in contrast to the shallow peptide grooves of conventional MHC molecules. However, the ligand repertoire of CD1d is distinct from that of CD1a-c. This review focuses on CD1d-restricted iNKT cells. Activation of iNKT cells via their semi-invariant TCR, often in synergy with NK receptors and other co-stimulatory molecules, triggers a rapid, polyfunctional response. Unlike conventional MHC-restricted T cells, individual iNKT cells can simultaneously produce both Th1- and Th2-type cytokines and exert cytotoxic activity in an immune synapse-directed fashion. Through this combination of direct cytotoxicity and cytokine-mediated immunomodulation, iNKTs can eliminate target cells while activating myeloid and other lymphoid populations to amplify immune responses. Their versatility has fueled growing interest in harnessing iNKT cells across inflammatory, infectious, and oncological diseases, where early-phase studies have demonstrated their safety and preliminary efficacy. Moreover, because they are restricted by the non-polymorphic CD1d molecule and possess immune-regulatory properties, iNKT cells lack graft-versus-host potential, making them ideal candidates for allogeneic, off-the-shelf therapies. This review summarizes how iNKT cells are being reimagined as innovative tools for immune intervention across a range of clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) has been implicated in multiple inflammatory diseases by regulating pro-inflammatory mediators or altering immune cell polarization. However, the expression and direct functional role of CB1 in T cells remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that primary murine T cells express CB1 and that its novel agonist, BI-5756, directly increases the frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in primary murine pan T cells after activation. In addition, BI-5756 exhibits an in vivo protective effect against graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), an allogeneic T cell-mediated inflammatory complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), resulting in an improved overall survival with enhanced platelet recovery and reconstitution of bone marrow-derived B and T cells. BI-5756 also directly suppresses tumor cell growth and upregulates MHC I, MHC II, and CD80 on tumor cells, which may subsequently enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses in mixed lymphocyte reaction with A20 cells. The ability of BI-5756 to increase Tregs was significantly abrogated by rimonabant, a potent and selective CB1 antagonist, suggesting that the immunomodulatory effect of BI-5756 is mediated via CB1. In summary, BI-5756, a potent CB1 agonist, increases Tregs while preserving anti-tumor responses in vitro and effectively reduces GvHD in vivo.">

 Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) is a cutting-edge treatment strategy modulating T cell activity and has emerged at the forefront of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management, yet most patients do not durably respond. Studies have shown that innate immune cells could create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) thus, resulting in resistance to ICB. Therefore, to design an effective therapeutic strategy, it is imperative to consider the diverse immune cells and their complex interactome. In noncancerous conditions, pro-inflammatory neutrophils release extracellular traps or NETs that interfere with monocyte differentiation to macrophages. However, their interaction and its effect in mediating immune evasion in NSCLCs is poorly understood.



 To study the role of neutrophils in macrophage behaviour, freshly isolated monocytes were differentiated into pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages and polarized with or without NETs. These NETs-educated macrophages (NeMacs) were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Functionally, their role in the TME was investigated using a Tumor-Immune-Microenvironment on-chip (TIMEoC) platform. Here, immune cells such as donor matched T cells or neutropils were loaded into a microfluidic channel magnetically attached to active NSCLC spheroids embedded in a collagenous matrix containing NeMacs. T-cell or neutrophil migration and tumor cytotoxicity in the presence of NeMacs were monitored on TIMEoC.



 In the presence of NETs, macrophages presented an immunosuppresive phenotype with significantly reduced expression of CD80, a key co-stimulatory receptor for T cell activation. NeMacs recruited significantly more neutrophils to the tumor than M2-like macrophages. In contrast, NeMacs retarded activated CD8+ T cell migration to the TME and significantly impacted their cytotoxic abilities observed by caspase 3/7 expression. The presence of NeMacs also affected ICB efficacy in vitro.



 Therefore, NETs could reprogram macrophages to create an immune-suppressive TME. This study was able to unveil previously unexplored relationship between NETs and macrophages in NSCLCs which could help identify prospective targets that could augment the current standard of care.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint blockade, which is standard-of-care therapy in the high-risk adjuvant and first-line metastatic-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) setting, relies on re-invigorating T cells for anti-tumor immunity. Belzutifan, a HIF2α inhibitor, was recently approved as a treatment for refractory, sporadic advanced RCC, and is under investigation in combination with pembrolizumab in the adjuvant (LITESPARK-022) and first-line metastatic (LITESPARK-012) setting. While preclinical murine studies suggest that HIF signaling enhances CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, the impact of pharmacologic HIF2α inhibition on human T cell function remains unknown. We aimed to determine how HIF2α inhibition affects human T cell effector function (proliferation and cytokine production) under hypoxic conditions mimicking the RCC tumor microenvironment. Methods T cells were isolated from fresh human ccRCC tumors (ie, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) or from healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads for 48 hours under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. HIF2α knockout (KO) T cells were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 electroporation. RT-qPCR and bulk RNA sequencing were used for transcriptomic analysis. For functional assays, T cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle), tacrolimus (control for effective inhibition of T cell function), or HIF2α inhibitors (belzutifan or PT2399). Cytokine production (IFNγ, IL-2, TNFα) was measured via intracellular flow cytometry, and proliferation was assessed using a flow cytometry-based dye dilution assay (CellTrace Violet). Results HIF2α mRNA expression increased ∼70-fold in T cells upon stimulation under hypoxic conditions. Differential gene expression analysis of bulk RNA sequencing revealed that IL-2 and IFNγ were among the most significantly downregulated genes in HIF2α knockout T cells, with log2 fold changes of –4.08 and –2.13, and adjusted p-values of 3.1 × 10-¹¹ and 5.5 × 10-²˚, respectively. Despite these transcriptional changes, pharmacologic treatment with belzutifan or PT2399 did not significantly alter cytokine production at the protein level in CD8+ T cells from either healthy donor PBMCs or ccRCC tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Similarly, proliferation assays revealed no significant difference in division index upon treatment with belzutifan or PT2399 compared to DMSO control. Of note, hypoxia alone reduced CD8+ T cell proliferation (P = .0048) and enhanced CD4+ T cell proliferation (P = .0034) compared to normoxia, but HIF2α inhibition did not modulate these effects. Conclusions Although HIF2α is strongly upregulated under hypoxia and its genetic deletion reduces cytokine gene expression, short-term pharmacologic inhibition does not impair effector cytokine production at the protein level or alter proliferation of human CD8+ T cells in vitro. In the settings examined, HIF2α inhibition did not impair T cell function, suggesting that combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors remains a viable therapeutic strategy pending results of ongoing clinical studies. Ongoing laboratory-based assessment will assess the impact of prolonged HIF2α inhibition on T cell phenotype, evaluate its effects on direct cytotoxicity using antigen-specific RCC killing assays, and examine potential synergy with anti–PD-1 therapy.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is defined by a myeloid-enriched microenvironment and has shown remarkable resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD-1 and CTLA-4). Here, we sought to define the role of myeloid immunosuppression in immune resistance in PDA. We report that depletion of CSF1R+ myeloid cells in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy triggers T cell infiltration into PDA but causes compensatory remodeling of the myeloid compartment with limited tumor control. Unexpectedly, combined therapy against multiple myeloid targets including CSF1R, CCR2/5 and CXCR2 was insufficient to overcome treatment resistance. High-dimensional single cell analyses performed on T cell infiltrates in human and mouse PDA revealed upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4. Combinatorial blockade of PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 along with chemotherapy and anti-CSF1R was necessary to trigger activation of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and led to deep, durable, and complete tumor responses, with each immune checkpoint blockade agent contributing to efficacy. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive approach targeting both negative regulatory signals controlling T cell function and the myeloid compartment will be fundamental to unveiling the potential of immunotherapy in PDA.">

NEUs exacerbate mucosal injury through reactive oxygen species (ROS), neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), proteases, and cytokine interactions, while also exhibiting dual roles in tissue repair. Macrophages contribute to UC progression via M1-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine release and epithelial barrier disruption, whereas M2 macrophages promote resolution through anti-inflammatory signals (IL-10, TGF-β) and epithelial regeneration. Clinically, NEU-derived biomarkers predict disease activity and therapeutic response, while macrophage-targeted therapies modulate inflammation.

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the migratory behaviors of key immune cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, regulatory T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils and the molecular mechanisms that guide their trafficking from lymphoid organs to inflamed tissues. We highlight the stepwise migration cascade: priming in secondary lymphoid organs, trafficking through blood vessels, adhesion to endothelium, and extravasation into tissues. Each step is critically regulated by chemokines, selectins, integrins, and proteases. We also examine current pharmacological strategies that target immune cell migration in inflammatory diseases, such as integrin blockers and chemokine receptor antagonists, emphasizing both therapeutic potential and clinical limitations. In addition, we discuss emerging technologies including intravital imaging, CRISPR-based screening, and computational modeling that provide novel insights into immune cell dynamics and may guide the development of next generation migration-targeted therapies. Overall, this review integrates fundamental immunological principles with translational medicine by identifying key challenges, unresolved controversies, and future directions in the therapeutic modulation of immune cell migration.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of tumor cells, stromal cells, infiltrating immune cells and non-cellular components such as extracellular matrix, blood vessels and a wide variety of secreted proteins. Evidence shows that beyond supporting tumor growth, the TME also promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion and contributes to treatment resistance, ultimately affecting patient prognosis. Cell-to-cell communication within the TME is driven by secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and interferons, which are produced not only by tumor cells but also by various stromal cells and immune cells. These proteins form a complex signaling network that promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion and enables tumors to evade innate and adaptive immune responses. Antibody arrays are a technology that can simultaneously screen hundreds of secreted proteins in complex biological samples, aiding in the exploration of this complex signaling network. By combining high-throughput multiplex immunoassays such as antibody arrays with cellular and molecular biology techniques, researchers have uncovered complex regulatory mechanisms of cytokine networks within the TME. The present review summarized recent findings on the communication between tumor cells and the TME, as well as key secreted proteins essential for tumor progression and the development of therapeutic resistance. In addition, it discusses how high-throughput antibody arrays contribute to our understanding of regulatory networks of secreted proteins in the TME.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a formidable malignancy with persistently poor clinical outcomes. Recent research has underscored the pivotal role of the innate immune system, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the myeloid lineage, in orchestrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and shaping disease progression. As professional phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages not only mediate pathogen recognition and inflammatory responses but also undergo functional polarization in response to local cues. In OSCC, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, marked by the overrepresentation of species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis—acts as a chronic inflammatory trigger that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune evasion, and tumor growth. These pathogenic bacteria actively engage innate immune signaling pathways such as TLRs and CSF-1R, skewing macrophages toward an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. M2-like TAMs then contribute to tumor progression by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), promoting angiogenesis, and expressing immune checkpoint ligands such as PD-L1. This review summarizes current knowledge on the bidirectional crosstalk between dysbiotic microbiota and innate immune macrophages in OSCC, highlighting key receptor-mediated pathways and their implications for immune suppression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting microbiota modulation or innate immune reprogramming represents a promising strategy for restoring anti-tumor immunity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy in OSCC.">

        <tr id="Background Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disease marked by immune dysregulation and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. While biologics like adalimumab target specific pathways, their limited efficacy highlights the need for broader immunomodulatory treatments. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have shown promise due to their immunosuppressive properties and ability to modulate both innate and adaptive immunity. This study investigates the effects of naïve (n-MSCs) and cytokine-preactivated (a-MSCs) placental MSCs on the immune responses in HS. Methods MSCs were isolated from healthy term placentas and either used naïvely or preactivated with IFN-γ and TNF-α. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HS patients (n=3) and healthy donors (n=3) were co-cultured with n-MSCs, a-MSCs, or adalimumab. Additionally, lesional, perilesional, and healthy 4 mm in diameter skin punch biopsies from 10 HS patients and 3 controls were cultured in a transwell system with the same interventions. Flow cytometry assessed lymphocytes proliferation and T cell subsets while Luminex assays measured cytokine levels. Results Both n-MSCs and a-MSCs significantly inhibited lymphocytes proliferation and shifted T cell populations, increasing CD4+ and decreasing CD8+ T cells. The a-MSCs notably reduced IL-17A and IFN-γ in PBMC co-cultures; n-MSCs had partial effects. HS skin explants exhibited elevated IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-17A compared to healthy skin. The n-MSCs markedly reduced all three cytokines in lesional and perilesional tissues. Moreover, a-MSCs selectively increased IL-10 in lesional skin. Conclusion Placental MSCs, especially in their naïve form, demonstrate potent immunomodulatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and altering T cell dynamics in HS. Compared to adalimumab, MSCs offer a broader immunoregulatory profile, suggesting their potential as a multitarget therapy for HS. These findings support further clinical investigation of MSC-based treatments in managing this complex disease.">

        <tr id="Glioblastomas are the most prevalent and malignant primary cancers in the brain. Given the promising prospects of immunotherapeutic approaches, there is increasing interest in obtaining precise knowledge of the immunologic status of the tumour microenvironment for each individual. We explored the feasibility of inferring this tumour immune component in a minimally invasive manner prior to any clinical intervention, taking advantage of the preoperative immune cell counts that can be easily obtained from the clinical records of the patients. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is the most extensive measure calculated from complete counts of peripheral blood. Despite there was an increase in the NLR in high grade tumours of our cohorts of study, we did not find evidence of any correlation between the NLR and different degrees of tumour immune infiltration in glioblastoma. The same negative result was obtained with the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR). In addition, glioblastomas associated with extreme values of peripheral NLR did not exhibit substantial gene expression differences that could be linked to distinct tumourigenic properties. Overall, these results suggest that peripheral immune cell ratios cannot be used to reliably infer the immune microenvironment within the tumour, underscoring the complexity of using peripheral markers to assess local tumour immunity.

Its role in adult sepsis however, has yet to be delineated. We conducted a prospective observational study of 42 critically ill septic adult patients on the Intensive Care Unit, comparing serum amphiregulin levels and the frequencies of EGFR-expressing myeloid and lymphoid cells (using spectral flow cytometry) in sepsis survivors and non-survivors, and 20 healthy volunteers. We demonstrate, for the first time, the strong association between serum amphiregulin and in-hospital mortality (AUROC = 0.87). Moreover, we demonstrate that a higher frequency of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes express either the ligand (AREG) or receptor (EGFR) ex vivo, in sepsis, and expression of CD4+ lymphocyte EGFR was associated with several features of immunosuppression. Together, our data suggest that EGFR-signaling represents a novel candidate of T cell dysregulation in sepsis and warrants further investigation.">

 Despite promising safety profiles, B7-H3 CAR T cell therapies have yet to demonstrate meaningful clinical efficacy in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a devastating pediatric brain cancer characterized by a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This TME is dominated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and suppressive resident microglia that restrict CAR T-cell activation and persistence. Importantly, broad myeloid targeting risks eliminating macrophages essential for supporting T cell activation and anti-tumor immunity. We identified CD123 as a selective marker of suppressive TAMs in DIPG and hypothesized that dual targeting of CD123+ TAMs alongside B7-H3+ tumor cells would effectively remodel the TME, restore T cell function, and enhance therapeutic efficacy.



 Using immunocompetent DIPG models, we evaluated a sequential combination of CD123 and B7-H3 CAR T cells to remodel the TME and improve tumor control. In vitro assays included cytotoxicity, repeated antigen stimulation, and co-cultures with M1- or M2-polarized macrophages. Endpoints included TAM depletion, TME remodeling, tumor burden, and survival.



 In vitro, M2 macrophages suppressed B7-H3 CAR T cell proliferation, persistence, and cytokine secretion; these effects were reversed by co-treatment with CD123 CAR T cells. CD123 CAR T cells selectively depleted M2-like TAMs and microglia without cytotoxicity against B7-H3+ DIPG tumor cells. In vivo, CD123 CAR T cell treatment reduced immunosuppressive TAMs and shifted the tumor microenvironment toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, as demonstrated by intracellular cytokine staining and comprehensive flow cytometry analyses. Notably, administration of CD123 CAR T cells after B7-H3 CAR T cell infusion failed to rescue antitumor activity. However, administering CD123 CAR T cells within a four-day window prior to B7-H3 CAR T cell infusion significantly enhanced tumor control. Dual CAR therapy substantially decreased tumor burden, limited suppressive myeloid and microglial infiltration, and improved T cell activation and persistence, resulting in extended survival compared to monotherapies, with some mice achieving durable tumor remission. Ongoing transcriptomic studies are underway to elucidate the mechanisms driving this robust, lasting antitumor immunity.



 Priming the TME with CD123 CAR T cells significantly improves B7-H3 CAR T cell efficacy in aggressive DIPG models. Dual targeting of CD123+ TAMs and B7-H3+ tumor cells reprograms the DIPG TME and enhances CAR T-cell function by overcoming immunosuppressive barriers while preserving supportive immune populations. This strategy offers a promising mechanistic approach to improving CAR T therapy in DIPG.

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with limited responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies in most patients. Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a crucial role in immunotherapy outcomes. Among various metabolic abnormalities in the TIME, dysregulated lipid metabolism has emerged as a critical determinant of immune cell fate, differentiation, and function. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the current understanding of the immune landscape in GC, focusing on how altered lipid metabolism reshapes immune cell populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We highlight key metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation(FAO), cholesterol homeostasis, and lipid uptake that impact immune cell activity, contributing to immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Importantly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism, including inhibitors of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and discuss their synergistic potential when combined with ICB therapies. In conclusion, lipid metabolic reprogramming represents a promising yet underexplored axis in modulating antitumor immunity in GC. Integrating metabolic intervention with immunotherapy holds potential to overcome current treatment limitations and improve clinical outcomes. Future studies incorporating spatial omics and single-cell profiling will be essential to elucidate cell-type specific metabolic dependencies and foster translational breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are DNA-protein structures released during a form of programmed neutrophil death known as NETosis. While NETs have been implicated in both tumor inhibition and promotion, their functional role in cancer remains ambiguous. In this study, we compared the NET-forming capacity and functional effects of NETs derived from lung cancer (LC) patients and healthy donors (H). Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood and stimulated in vitro with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce NETosis. Isolated NETs were quantified and assessed for their cytotoxicity against A549 lung cancer cells and their impact on cancer cell migration. Whereas LC neutrophils (LCN) were less cytotoxic to tumor cells than H neutrophils (HN), their NETs maintained similar tumoricidal capacity – 41.6% ± 25.3% (LCN) vs. 46.4% ± 14.5% (HN), ns. Interestingly, we noted a correlation between the amount of NETs and their cytotoxicity to tumor cells. This effect could not be recapitulated with purified genomic DNA, inducing only 3.99% of cytotoxicity to tumor cells, and confirming that intact NETs are required for the anti-tumor activity. LCN displayed an increased frequency of NETosis following PMA stimulation, yet produced significantly fewer NETs per cell – 1569 ± 306 ng (LCN) vs. 2619 ± 313 ng (HN); p = 0.025. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was elevated in LC neutrophils, indicating that the NETosis defect was not due to impaired oxidative burst. LCN had increased expression of immunosuppression (PDL-1) as well as exhaustion and aging markers CD62L and CD11b). Only NETs from HN inhibited the migration of A549 tumor cells, whereas those from LCN failed to suppress, and in some cases appeared to enhance, cell motility. Our data suggest that NETs in lung cancer retain anti-tumor cytotoxicity capabilities but lose their anti-migratory capacity, highlighting their dual role in tumor biology and potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and clinically challenging subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of hormone receptors and HER2 amplification. This molecular profile limits the effectiveness of targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the mainstay of treatment a strategy often met with limited success due to rapid disease progression and high recurrence rates. Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in driving TNBC pathogenesis, particularly through chronic inflammation and cytokine dysregulation. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 orchestrate a complex network of cellular interactions that remodel the TME into an immunosuppressive niche. This inflammatory landscape not only promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis but also compromises antitumor immune responses and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have explored the therapeutic potential of targeting cytokine signaling to disrupt this inflammatory axis and overcome resistance. In this review, we critically examine the multifaceted interplay between cytokines, inflammation, and the TME in TNBC, with a focus on mechanisms of resistance. We further evaluate current and emerging therapeutic approaches targeting the inflammatory axis, highlighting both the promise and the complexities of this evolving landscape.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT As an emerging component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), the intratumoural microbiota imperceptibly influences the progression of various human malignancies. However, the critical intratumoural microbiota and its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression have not been fully elucidated. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing and clinical samples analysis to identify the relationship between intratumoural bacteria and NSCLC progression. The results showed that significant abnormalities in the intratumoural microbiota of NSCLC. Specifically, the relative abundance of gram-negative bacteria in tumor was significantly increased, and network analysis revealed that Escherichia-Shigella and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae, which have strong abilities to synthesize the bacterial toxin LPS, significantly promoted tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that Escherichia-Shigella- and unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae-derived LPS activated the TLR4-mTOR-NF-κB-IL-6 axis to facilitate NSCLC cell proliferation, whereas rapamycin effectively delayed LPS-induced tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo functional experiments. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that the combination of intratumoural bacterial concentration, Escherichia-Shigella abundance, unclassified_f__Enterobacteriaceae abundance, and LPS content had greater diagnostic validity in predicting the probability of NSCLC, and the detection of these factors in blood has potential for using the non-invasive diagnosis of NSCLC. Overall, this study revealed the mechanism by which LPS from specific bacteria in TME promoted tumor development, providing new strategies for NSCLC treatment and diagnosis from a microbial perspective.">

        <tr id="Radionuclides such as Rhenium-188 (Re188) hold promise for treating metastatic cancers due to their cytotoxic effects and potential to stimulate systemic anti-tumor immunity. However, mononuclear phagocyte system-mediated clearance of liposome encapsulated Re188 (Lipo-Re188) limits its tumor delivery. This study aimed to enhance the therapeutic effect of Lipo-Re188 against lung metastases through macrophage depletion and immune checkpoint blockade. A lung metastatic colon cancer model was established via intravenous injection of CT26-luciferase cells and then treated with Lipo-Re188 (11.1 MBq, 30% of MTD), liposomal clodronate (Lipo-clod) for macrophage depletion, and/or anti-PD-L1 antibody. Tumor progression was monitored by bioluminescence imaging, and radionuclide biodistribution was assessed at 1, 24, and 48 h post-injection. Flow cytometry was used to assess immune cell populations in the spleen and tumor microenvironment (TME). Cytokine levels were measured using a bead-based multiplex assay and analyzed by flow cytometry. Macrophage depletion significantly enhanced tumor accumulation of Lipo-Re188 while reducing hepatic uptake and prolonging survival. The combination of Lipo-clod and Lipo-Re188 promoted B cells, restored functional T cells, and suppressed MDSC in both spleen and TME. Notably, IL-1α and GM-CSF levels were significantly elevated in the combination group. Triple therapy with Lipo-clod, Lipo-Re188, and anti-PD-L1 provided the greatest survival benefit, highest intratumoral B cell accumulation, and lowest interstitial macrophage levels, with no significant biological toxicity. Our study reveals that triple therapy overcomes immunosuppressive feedback and promotes a tumor-suppressive microenvironment. These findings support a rational combination strategy integrating radiopharmaceutical therapy with immune modulation for metastatic cancer treatment.">

In the progressive development of cancer, neutrophils exert dual roles in both anticancer and procancer processes through their heterogeneity. In recent years, research into the role of neutrophils in cancer and various nontumor diseases has been continuously deepening. However, current research in this area remains incomplete. This review comprehensively summarizes the tissue homing dynamics, lifespan regulation, and physiological functions of neutrophils, starting from their development and heterogeneity. Furthermore, we delineate the dual regulatory functions of neutrophils in carcinogenesis, encompassing both tumor‐suppressive mechanisms and protumor mechanisms. This section further synthesizes recent advancements in neutrophil‐targeted therapeutic platforms and biomimetic delivery systems, while critically evaluating persistent methodological and translational challenges in clinical applications. In addition, we systematically analyze the role of neutrophils in non‐neoplastic diseases and list several typical diseases, including infectious diseases. Finally, we also discuss current controversies and research perspectives on neutrophils. It is hoped that this review will deepen insights into the role of neutrophils in homeostasis and disease, while exploring their potential in disease treatment.">

        <tr id="A major goal in regenerative medicine is restoring damaged tissues through cell replacement or by activating endogenous repair pathways. Immune modulation is increasingly recognized as essential for creating a permissive environment for regeneration. Bioactive factors secreted by stem and stromal cells -either as soluble molecules or within extracellular vesicles (EVs)- can reshape immune responses, not just by reducing inflammation but by actively promoting pro-resolving, regenerative profiles. For nearly two decades, our research has focused on the therapeutic potential of human term placenta-derived cells, particularly mesenchymal stromal cells from the amniotic membrane (hAMSC). We have shown that hAMSC and their secretome (CM-hAMSC) exert potent immunomodulatory effects in vitro: suppressing T- and B-cell proliferation, downregulating proinflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotypes, enhancing regulatory T cells, and inhibiting naïve CD8 T cell polarization into memory subsets. They also reduce B-cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells and steer monocytes away from dendritic cells and M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. These effects have translated into therapeutic benefits in numerous preclinical models of inflammation-driven disease (including lung/liver fibrosis, sepsis, IBD, cardiac ischemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and traumatic brain injury) by tempering inflammation and promoting resolution. Ongoing studies aim to dissect the mechanisms driving these effects, especially whether they are mediated by soluble molecules, EVs, or both. A key area of interest is their ability to modulate the inflammasome pathway, a central driver of innate immunity linked to aging and degeneration. By regulating this pathway, placental factors may redirect chronic inflammation toward regeneration. Given inflammation’s dual role as trigger and barrier in many degenerative conditions, placental cells -especially those from the amniotic membrane- emerge as a powerful paradigm. This lecture will explore how their unique immunological properties can inspire innovative regenerative strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). CD4+ CD25+hi Tregs, which normally suppress immune responses, exhibit impaired function in MS. Treg-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry immunoregulatory proteins and miRNAs that modulate T-cell activity. However, EVs from MS patients show reduced suppressive capacity, suggesting their dysfunction contributes to MS pathogenesis. This highlights EVs' potential role in MS development and therapy. Methods: Tregs were differentiated from naïve T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donor, then transduced with B2M-shRNA lentivirus to generate HLA class I-knockdown Tregs. Extracellular vesicles—including natural vesicles, cytochalasin B-induced artificial vesicles, and ultrasound-induced artificial vesicles—were isolated from Tregs and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), flow cytometry, and Western blot. Their effects on healthy donor and MS patient PBMCs were evaluated via flow cytometry and ELISA (IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ). Results: Ultrasonication yielded a higher number оf vesicles enriched with key immunosuppressive proteins, including PD-1 and Tim-3, compared to cytochalasin B. Functional assays demonstrated the ability оf ultrasonication-induced AVs to suppress inflammatory markers, such as IFNγ, and modulate the cytokine profile in both healthy and MS-derived PBMCs. Conclusion: Developing effective MS therapies remains challenging. While cellular therapies face limitations like Treg dysfunction and CNS delivery issues, allogeneic EVs offer a promising alternative due to their scalability, low immunogenicity, and blood-brain barrier penetration. We developed Treg-derived artificial vesicles (TrAVs) that maintain immunosuppressive properties and modulate PBMC responses, suggesting therapeutic potential for MS. Further research is needed to optimize production and validate efficacy in disease models.">

In a sheep model of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, PD-L1 expression was correlated with BLV proviral load, and TIM-3 expression was upregulated in multiple T-cell subsets. Moreover, TIM-3 blockade, alone or combined with PD-L1 inhibition, enhanced T-cell activation and cytokine production, while PD-L1 blockade alone had limited effects. These findings demonstrate that TIM-3 plays a role in T-cell dysfunction in sheep and support the use of sheep as a model for evaluating immunotherapies targeting immunoinhibitory molecules in BLV infection and other chronic infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal primary brain malignancy in adults, and therapeutic gains have been modest despite multimodal standard care. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative, yet its performance in GBM is constrained by a profoundly immunosuppressive neuro-immune micro-environment, the physical and functional barriers of the blood–brain interface, and adaptative resistance pathways. In this review we summarise recent progress in myeloid-reprogramming agents, immune-checkpoint modulation, adoptive cellular therapies and device-enabled delivery platforms that seek to revitalise anti-tumour surveillance within the central nervous system. We also discuss enduring challenges—including intratumoural spatial heterogeneity, limited effector lymphocyte trafficking and the scarcity of robust predictive biomarkers—that temper durable responses. By thoughtfully integrating immunologic approaches with radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, metabolic modifiers and focussed-ultrasound-mediated blood–brain-barrier disruption, emerging strategies aspire to enhance immune infiltration, bolster antigen presentation and overcome region-specific barriers. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of precision immunotherapy for GBM, offering perspective on future directions and avenues for clinical translation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavour to develop more effective and individualised treatment regimens for patients confronted with this formidable disease.">

        <tr id="Background : Unlike T cells, natural killer (NK) cells lack a dominant activating receptor analogous to the T cell receptor (TCR) that governs their activation. Whether chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) constructs engineered specifically for T cells can effectively drive NK cell activation remains unresolved. NK cells inherently possess non-specific recognition capacities and exert broad-spectrum cytotoxicity against diverse tumor targets. However, the complexity of receptor-ligand interactions between CAR NK cells and susceptible target cells has impeded efforts to delineate the specific functional contributions of individual CAR constructs. Methods : CAR NK cells were generated via electroporation. The murine B16 melanoma cell line was modified to express various target proteins using lentiviral transduction. In vitro functional assays, including conjugate formation, granule polarization, degranulation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine production, were employed to assess CAR NK cell efficacy. Recombinant protein-coated beads were used to investigate downstream activation signaling pathways. The in vivo antitumor activity of CAR NK cells was evaluated using NPG mouse xenograft models. Results : B16 cell line was first validated to be a suitable model for specifically assessing CAR construct function in CAR NK cells. Among nine distinct CAR molecules generated, the construct incorporating the NKG2DTM-2B4-FCER1G exhibited the most potent capacity to enhance NK cell-mediated functionalities. Consistent with these functional improvements, this CAR construct induced robust phosphorylation of key activation pathways, including AKT, VAV1, ERK, PLC γ 1, and NF-κ B. Conclusions : The CAR construct incorporating the NKG2DTM-2B4-FCER1G is demonstrated to be the most effective in enhancing NK cell functionality.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening disease caused by a dysfunctional host response to infection. During sepsis, inflammation-related immunosuppression is the critical factor causing secondary infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The regulatory mechanisms underlying regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and function, which significantly contribute to septic immunosuppression, require further clarification. In this study, we found that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) participated in the development of sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation and function via direct interaction with CD4+ T cells. Briefly, NETs anchored enolase 1 (ENO1) on the membrane of CD4+ T cells through its key protein myeloperoxidase (MPO) and subsequently recruited interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2). IFITM2 acted as a DNA receptor that sensed NETs-DNA and activated intracellular RAS-associated protein 1B (RAP1B) and its downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway to promote Treg differentiation and function. ENO1 inhibition significantly attenuated NETs-induced Treg differentiation and alleviated sepsis in mice. Overall, we demonstrated the role of NETs in sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation, identified ENO1 as an anchor of NETs-MPO, and elucidated the downstream molecular mechanism by which IFITM2-RAP1B-ERK regulated Treg differentiation. These findings improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of sepsis and provide potential therapeutic targets for sepsis-induced immunosuppression.">

 Ovarian cancer (OC) has an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment (TME) with poor responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Understanding tumor immune-cell interactions is critical to overcome barriers to ICB. There is growing evidence that the chromatin remodeler complex, mammalian switch/sucrose non-fermentable (mSWI/SNF) affects downstream immune pathways in cancer. Our previous study has shown that loss-of-function as well as therapeutic inhibition of the mSWI/SNF subunit, SMARCA4, leads to increased immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo. We found that SMARCA4 loss in OC cell lines leads to increased MHC1 antigen presentation and upregulation of interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, including IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and RNA sensors involved in the anti-viral RNA sensing pathway. Our in vivo results show anti-tumor immune suppression of SMARCA4-KO OC tumors, resulting from a more active innate and adaptive immune TME. We further demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of SMARCA4 gene product BRG1 can recapitulate these findings in vitro and in vivo. An epigenetic library screen of SMARCA4-mutated OC cells revealed DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) as a top hit. There is evidence that therapeutic inhibition of this target may synergize in the context of SMARCA4 inhibition by activating ISGs through increased gene accessibility and transcription from decreased histone methylation. Based on our previous data, we hypothesize that combination of BRG1 inhibitor (BRG1i) and DNMT inhibition can reverse immune evasion in the OC TME and sensitize OCs to ICB. Using murine syngeneic and human OC cell lines, the expression of type I IFN and antigen presentation genes are characterized in vitro to demonstrate the immunogenic effect of dual epigenetic therapy. Combined BRG1 and DNMT1 inhibition in murine OC cells ID8 TP53-/- results in an increased fold change of ISG expression by RT-qPCR when compared to monotherapy. These results were validated in the human OC cells. Furthermore, combination therapy in murine and human cells increases the expression of antigen presentation marker MHC1 at the cells surface. In vivo, we observed a trend towards decreased tumor burden and the prevention of ascites development with dual epitherapy. Immune cell infiltration and activation in the TME will be subsequently investigated. Moreover, in an ongoing pilot study the anti-tumor response to anti-PD1 ICB combined with both epitherapies yields decreased tumor growth compared to both anti-PD1 alone and dual therapy alone. Taken together, these data uncover potential therapeutically innovative ways to exploit functional characteristics of epigenetic modulation and are immediately relevant to the design of next generation OC therapeutics.

 CD8 T cells are effector cells of the adaptive immune system responsible for mediating protective immune responses in cancer. However, CD8 T cells can also be critical drivers of pathologic responses including autoimmunity. A key feature of these cells is that they must infiltrate tissues to execute their primary function of cell killing. It is well established that naive T cell responses do not originate in these tissues. Rather, prior to antigen-driven activation, naïve T cells are restricted to lymph nodes, spleen, and blood. T cell activation by cognate antigen drives expression of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors, including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and/or cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), as well as migration to nonlymphoid tissues. Work over the last two decades has harnessed T cell effector activities by blocking PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, which has revolutionized cancer care and demonstrated remarkable efficacy in diverse cancer types. However, many patients do not respond to checkpoint blockade therapy, and worse, other patients develop autoimmune-like immune-related adverse events (irAEs), limiting the utility of this approach. To maximize the therapeutic benefit of checkpoint blockade without accelerated irAE development, targeted approaches are needed to increase recruitment of protective CD8 T cells to tumors while preventing pathogenic T cell entry into sensitive tissues. However, an inability to granularly measure recruitment into non-lymphoid tissues has created a significant gap in knowledge in: 1) how checkpoint inhibitors impact T cell entry rates into tissues, 2) whether these entry rates are different for tumors and lesional irAE tissues, 3) where recruited cells localize, and 4) the precise functional contributions of recruited versus resident T cells in driving tumor regression or autoimmunity. To fill this gap in knowledge, we are utilizing an intravenous antibody labeling approach to mark CD8 T cells in the blood prior to entry into tissues, an approach which enables a 72-hour window to track tissue entry. Using this approach in the preclinical setting, we are interrogating how PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cell recruitment to tumors as well as the pancreas in the context of Type 1 Diabetes. In our tumor studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors induce an increase in the number of recently recruited CD8 T cells, and that these recruited T cells have a less exhausted phenotype than the T cells that have been in the tumor for longer. In our diabetes studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cells both in the periphery and the pancreas, and in some mice cause an increase in migration to the pancreas. These studies support a model where peripheral CD8 T cell recruitment can positively contribute to productive anti-tumor immunity but can also exacerbate autoimmunity. Thus, our studies emphasize the doubled-edged nature of T cell recruitment, and our future studies will examine ways to both improve recruitment to tumors and mitigate recruitment to lesional irAE tissues.

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, revolutionizing cancer treatment paradigms. Since the groundbreaking development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka in 2008, significant progress has been made in generating various iPSCs-derived immunocytes, including T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells. These engineered immune cells offer unprecedented opportunities for personalized cancer therapy as they can be derived from patients’ own cells to minimize immune rejection. In addition, various new techniques are being used for the induction and amplification of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, such as small-molecule techniques, 3D culture systems, nanotechnology, and animal models for the in vivo amplification of immunocytes. Of course, challenges remain in improving immunocyte characteristics. Targeting efficiency needs enhancement to better distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue, while biological activity must be optimized for sustained antitumor effects. Safety concerns, particularly regarding potential off-target effects and cytokine release syndrome, require further investigation. The immunosuppressive nature of tumor microenvironment also poses significant hurdles for solid tumor treatment. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the therapeutic potential of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, with researchers investigating combination therapies and genetic modifications to overcome current limitations.">

        <tr id="Reinvigoration of tumor-reactive T cells using co-stimulatory bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) targeting CD28 is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy. Conditional, tumor-specific recruitment can offer a layer of control and specificity. We developed pH-selective CD28xVISTA bsAbs to act specifically within the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming for enhanced T cell-mediated cancer cell killing while minimizing systemic T-cell activation and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) risk. CD28 agonism by our CD28xVISTA bsAbs relies on pH-selective engagement of VISTA, a protein robustly expressed on myeloid cells abundant in most solid tumors. Our lead candidate displayed pH-dependent engagement of VISTA and simultaneous binding to CD28, resulting in VISTA-dependent CD28 signaling in a reporter cell line. CD28xVISTA avidly binds VISTA+ cells, and co-stimulatory activity was shown in vitro by its ability to activate and expand T cells and enhance T cell-mediated cancer cell killing in co-cultures of human PBMCs and cancer cells in the presence of a TAA-targeted anti-CD3 T-cell engager. This CD28xVISTA bsAb efficiently inhibited the growth of human VISTA-expressing MC38 tumors in a humanized CD28 syngeneic mouse model in combination with PD-1 blockade. Our findings support signaling both in cis (between T cell and target cell displaying peptide-MHC complex) and in trans, with stimulation occurring through CD28 clustering outside of the immune synapse. This CD28xVISTA bsAb showed no signs of superagonistic properties in several in vitro CRS assays. Thus, our data supports clinical development for solid tumors in combination with anti-PD-1 or TAA-targeted anti-CD3 T-cell engagers.">

        <tr id="Background Immune tolerance in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) enables cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as crucial immunosuppressive regulators, shape the tumor microenvironment and contribute to resistance against immunotherapy. However, the regulatory mechanisms of MDSCs in ovarian cancer remain poorly understood. Methods We examined the presence and distribution of MDSCs in peripheral blood and tumor tissues from EOC patients. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on ovarian cancer cells co-cultured with MDSCs. The role of Serum Amyloid A1 (SAA1) was investigated through in vitro functional assays, co-culture experiments, and in vivo mouse models. Results MDSCs were enriched in both peripheral blood and tumor tissues of EOC patients. SAA1 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cells after interaction with MDSCs and confirmed in tumor samples and cell lines. Functionally, SAA1 promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. It also recruited MDSCs via TLR2/4, induced the differentiation of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), and stimulated IL-1β secretion, which in turn enhanced SAA1 expression, forming a positive feedback loop. In vivo, SAA1 promoted tumor progression and ascites formation. Clinically, high levels of SAA1, IL-1β, and CD33⁺ MDSCs correlated with poor survival. Conclusion This study uncovers a novel SAA1–IL-1β feedback loop that promotes immunosuppression and progression in ovarian cancer. These findings provide insight into tumor–immune interactions and suggest a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for EOC.

        <tr id="In recent years, tumor metastasis has become one of the major causes of high recurrence and mortality in cancer patients. Owing to multiorgan involvement, metastatic cancers are now clinically difficult to cure and often have a very poor prognosis. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that the establishment of a premetastatic niche (PMN) is necessary for tumor metastasis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are closely related to tumor development, are deeply involved in regulating PMN establishment. By regulating EVs, metabolism and other pathways, CAFs actively shape microenvironmental characteristics, including inflammation, angiogenesis, increased vascular permeability, lymphangiogenesis, immunosuppression and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. With the development of single-cell sequencing technology, our understanding of the role and significance of heterogeneous CAFs in the PMN has improved. Multiple therapeutic strategies targeting CAFs in the PMN have also been developed. This article focuses on the crosstalk of different subtypes of CAFs with other stromal cells, the mechanisms by which CAFs of different origins mediate PMN formation, and the emerging cancer therapeutic strategies by which CAFs have been targeted in recent years.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most lethal primary brain tumors, characterized by profound immunosuppression and resistance to conventional immunotherapy. A hallmark of the GBM microenvironment is the prevalence of functionally exhausted T cells, marked by sustained expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and impaired effector function. These exhausted T cells represent a major barrier to durable anti-tumor immunity and effective immunotherapeutic intervention. To overcome this, we investiagated the therapeutic potential of PD1-IL2v, a novel immunocytokine designed to selectively deliver IL-2 signaling to PD1-1+ cells while avoiding expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs).



 We employed two murine models of glioblastoma: GL261, a commonly used immunogenic model, and SB28, an aggressive, poorly immunogenic model that is resistant to immune checkpoint blockade. PD1-IL2v was administered either systemically or intratumorally. Flow cytometry was used to phenotypically characterize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), with a focus on exhaustion markers and effector phenotypes. In the SB28 model, we additionally evaluated the combination of PD1-IL2v with radiotherapy and temozolomide to reflect the current clinical standard of care.



 Local administration of PD1-Il2v, but not systemic delivery, effectively reactivated CD8⁺ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Treated mice exhibited enhanced cytokine production, increased proliferation, and restoration of cytotoxic activity in T cells. Phenotypic profiling revealed an expansion of a stem-like subset of exhausted T cells (PD-1⁺TCF1⁺), alongside the emergence of a novel, differentiated population with superior effector functions—termed “better-effector” T cells. Therapeutic intervention with PD1-IL2v led to prolonged survival, complete tumor rejection in a subset of animals, and increased infiltration of functional T cells into the tumor core. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of PD1-IL2v in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide—the standard of care for glioblastoma—in the SB28 model.



 Our findings underscore T cell exhaustion as an untapped reservoir of tumor-reactive T cells that can be therapeutically reinvigorated using PD1-IL2v. This approach not only restores anti-tumor immunity but also induces superior effector populations capable of driving tumor regression.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a dominant immune component within the glioma microenvironment and are increasingly recognized as key contributors to therapeutic resistance, the major challenge in glioma management. Understanding their role is critical for developing novel therapies. This review synthesizes current knowledge on TAM-mediated chemoresistance in glioma. TAMs originate from bone marrow-derived monocytes and resident microglia, exhibiting significant heterogeneity and plasticity, particularly between pro-inflammatory (M1) and pro-tumorigenic (M2) phenotypes. M2-like TAMs drive resistance through multiple mechanisms: (1) Modulating drug metabolism/clearance (e.g., via CYP450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein); (2) Secreting protumor factors (TNF-α, ILs like IL-4/IL-6/IL-10, chemokines like CCL5/CCL22, growth factors like VEGF/EGF) that activate survival pathways, induce immunosuppression, promote angiogenesis, and enhance epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); (3) Interacting with glioma stem cells (GSCs) to maintain stemness; (4) Facilitating microenvironmental adaptation (e.g., hypoxia/HIF-1α response); (5) Remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM) via MMPs, increasing stiffness and impairing drug penetration. Targeting TAMs offers promising approaches to overcome resistance. Strategies include: (1) Reprogramming M2 to M1 phenotypes using agonists (TLR, STING, CD40) or inhibitors (STAT3/STAT6); (2) Metabolic modulation (targeting glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, glutaminolysis); (3) Blocking recruitment axes (CCL2/CCR2, CSF-1/CSF-1R, CXCL12/CXCR4); (4) Depleting M2-TAMs (e.g., trabectedin, CAR-T cells, M2pep-drugs); (5) Enhancing phagocytosis (anti-SIRPα/CD47, anti-SIGLEC). TAMs are pivotal mediators of chemoresistance in glioma through diverse molecular and cellular mechanisms. Targeting TAM recruitment, polarization, function, or metabolism represents a promising therapeutic avenue. However, the complexity of the glioma microenvironment and blood-brain barrier necessitate combination strategies for clinical translation. Further research is needed to optimize specificity and overcome challenges like compensatory pathways and drug delivery.">

ACTM-838 utilizes the STACT platform to deliver IL-15/IL15Rα and a constitutively active STING to tumor-resident phagocytic antigen-presenting cells. Upon intravenous (IV) dosing to tumor-bearing mice, ACTM-838 distributed and enriched in the TME, exhibited specific uptake in tumor-resident phagocytic cells and led to expression of human IL-15/IL15Rα and murine IFNα in the tumor. ACTM-838 induced comprehensive TME changes to an immune permissive anti-tumor phenotype with a decrease in exhausted T-cells and Tregs and an increase in cytolytic T-cells and MHCII-high proliferating myeloid cells. ACTM-838-treated tumors exhibited upregulated anti-tumor innate and adaptive immunity expression profiles, T-, NK- and B-cell infiltration and downregulated cell cycle, DNA damage and TGFβ responses. Single-cell RNAseq and flow cytometry data confirmed activation and infiltration of both innate and adaptive immune cells. ACTM-838 showed durable anti-tumor efficacy in multiple murine tumor models and synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in combination.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that significantly endangers human health and hampers social development. The accumulation of eggs in the liver can lead to granuloma formation and liver fibrosis. Investigating the immune mechanisms involved may reveal new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis. Methods: We collected liver cells from both schistosome-infected mice with fibrotic livers and healthy mice for single-cell sequencing, which allowed us to explore the heterogeneity of immune cells in the fibrotic livers and to use ligand-receptor analysis to examine intercellular communication. Results: Single-cell sequencing showed significant upregulation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis in the fibrotic livers of schistosome-infected mice. Macrophages were the primary source of CXCL16, while CXCR6 was predominantly expressed in T cells. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in the livers of schistosomiasis, as well as CXCR6 in CD4+T cells and CD8+ T cells. Among different T-cell subsets, Th2 cells primarily expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR6. In CXCR6KO mice, we observed a reduced granuloma area and diminished liver fibrosis. CD4+ T cells were notably lower in the livers of CXCR6KO mice compared to wild-type mice, although there were no significant differences in CD8+ T cells and NKT cells. Furthermore, Th2 cells in the livers of CXCR6KO mice were markedly reduced, along with significant decreases in IL-13, IL-5, and IL-4 levels. In vitro, CXCR6 was significantly upregulated under Th2-polarizing conditions. Conclusions: Th2 cells are recruited to the liver via the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis, promoting granuloma formation and liver fibrosis in schistosomiasis. The CXCR6 pathway holds potential as a therapeutic target for treating schistosome-associated liver fibrosis.">

These discoveries have sparked growing interest in therapeutically targeting myeloid cells as a next generation strategy in cancer immunotherapy. As a complementary or alternative approach to T cell-centered immunotherapies, myeloid-directed therapies offer unique opportunities to reprogram the immune landscape, enhance antitumor responses, and overcome resistance mechanisms. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries in myeloid cell biology in cancer and discuss emerging therapeutic targets, with an emphasis on antibody-based therapies that have reached clinical development. We further provide perspective on translational challenges to implement these approaches into the clinic, and discuss how Fc-engineering and rational antibody design can optimize myeloid cell engagement and amplify their immune effector functions. Together, these advances position myeloid-directed immunotherapies as a promising approach to enhance the efficacy and durability of cancer treatment.">

While traditionally seen as passive players in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests that B cells actively influence antitumor responses. This study examines the role of B cells and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) in melanoma responses to ICB. Retrospective meta-analyses reveal increased B cell enrichment in ICB responders’ pretreatment. Functional assays show that B cell depletion impairs T cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity. EVs from melanoma tumors were analyzed, identifying miR-99a-5p in CD19+ EVs as up-regulated in responders. Silencing miR-99a-5p in B cells reduces T cell antitumor activity, suggesting its role in immune modulation. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p promotes B cell maturation via class-switch recombination. These findings underscore B cells’ impact on melanoma immunotherapy, offering insights into novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell–related pathways.">

 Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. This small CD4+CD25+CD127lo T cell population develops in the thymus and peripheral tissues through expression of the epigenetically stabilized transcription factor FOXP3. Tregs mediate their tolerogenic effects via multiple mechanisms, including secretion of inhibitory cytokines, IL-2 consumption to starve effector T cells, suppression of Teff cells through metabolic disruption, and modulation of antigen-presenting cell maturation and function. Collectively, these mechanisms broadly suppress immune cell activation and effector function. Additionally, Tregs can promote tissue repair, complementing their immunosuppressive effects. Recent advances have focused on harnessing Tregs as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases, aiming to restore immune tolerance and repair tissue damage. A key to therapeutic success lies in developing a stable Treg product that preserves functional activity and lineage integrity under inflammatory conditions. Previous studies have shown that polyclonal Tregs can be administered safely to patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. The cells can be detected in the circulation at least one year after administration and in small studies the cells have been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokines produced by effector T cells.
 In this presentation, I will highlight the differences between blood Tregs and the synovial microenvironment in the joints of healthy donors versus patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Additionally, I will present early preclinical and clinical data on our first engineered product, SBT-77-7101, which expresses a citrullinated protein (CitP)-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) derived from a RA patient-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibody. These CitP CAR-Tregs retain stable phenotypic and epigenetic profiles, remain functional in inflammatory environments, recognize multiple citrullinated proteins present in diseased tissue, and are activated by synovial fluid from patients with RA. Clinical studies of SBT-77-7101 in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa will be summarized. Finally, next-generation Treg engineering strategies aimed at enhancing Treg durability and specificity will be presented including approaches to maximize Treg stability via genome editing and develop synthetic FOXP3-dependent promoters to ensure controlled CAR expression.

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ranks as the sixth most prevalent malignancy worldwide, and is characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. Elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor-directed immune escape through ecological niche remodeling is crucial for advancing tumor biotherapy. The serum of patients with cancer contains not only tumor biomarkers but also immune regulators secreted by immune cells and/or cancer cells. Notably, the interstitial fluid within the cancer ecological niche is derived from serum. The cross-talk between serum and cancer cells determines the future of cancer cells, either cell survival or death. The present study revealed that serum from patients with OSCC could remodel the cancer immune escape ecological niche by promoting antigen-induced regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and T-cell exhaustion. When serum from patients with OSCC was added to a phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture system, the Treg subset was significantly increased compared with that in the culture system treated with fetal bovine serum. Moreover, when the serum of patients with OSCC was added to a PBMC culture system stimulated with tumor antigens, the activation of the CD3+ subset was significantly inhibited, and high levels of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β were detected in the supernatant; moreover, CD3+ T cells expressed high levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 and programmed death ligand 1, which is known to induce T-cell apoptosis and exhaustion. Finally, the antitumor effect of T cells were significantly decreased. These results indicated that the serum of patients with cancer can promote the inhibition and exhaustion of antitumor T cells, thereby remodeling the tumor immune escape ecological niche.">

 The dynamic evolution of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) during targeted therapy is a critical yet poorly understood determinant of treatment response and resistance. While most studies compare immune states before and after treatment, temporal immune changes during therapy remain largely uncharacterized, limiting development of effective combination strategies. Here, we investigated immune dynamics throughout targeted therapy using mouse melanoma models that recapitulate human therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified an inflection point where the inflamed TME during tumor regression, characterized by robust NK cell infiltration, transitions to an immune-excluded state upon onset of drug-tolerant residual disease. We uncovered a unique macrophage subset that orchestrates NK cell recruitment during regression. Depletion of these macrophages using LysM-cre;iDTR mice significantly reduced NK cell infiltration. Extending these findings to human cancer, longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of melanoma and lung cancer patient samples revealed dynamic NK cell infiltration during targeted therapy, establishing a direct link between innate immune remodeling and treatment outcome. Unlike prior prognostic studies assessing immune states at single time points, our results provide mechanistic evidence of a temporal relationship between NK cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy. Together, these findings position immune evolution as a driver of acquired resistance and identify macrophage–NK cell crosstalk as a therapeutically actionable axis to overcome immune exclusion and improve targeted therapy.

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are well-known antigen-presenting cells which have an important role in cancer immunomodulation due to the effective regulation of immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 gene (IDO1) is upregulated in many types of cancers and associated with a poor prognosis, contributing to an immunosuppressive TME. IDO1 silencing in DCs is considered a promising new strategy in gene therapy owing to their capability to regulate T cells function and activation. This study focuses on the use of magnetic hyperthermia (MH) combined with bioorthogonal chemistry to promote siRNA transfection against IDO1 in THP-1-derived DCs. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalized with cyclooctyne moieties were attached by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition to DCs membranes engineered to express artificial azide receptors. Upon the application of an alternating magnetic field, the MNPs generate heat and trigger the thermal disruption of the cell membrane. Results show that IDO1 gene expression decreases around 70% in THP-1-derived DCs, and that the MH-promoted transfection presents a silencing effect comparable to that attained with a gold standard Lipofectamine reagent, but with less cytotoxicity. Additionally, IDO1 silencing promotes the upregulation of mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-12A, and the downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, providing a more immunogenic state which may lead to THP-1-derived DCs activation for future T cells antitumor response. Our findings reveal the potential of MH-mediated transfection to enhance the intracellular delivery of silencing moieties in cells difficult to transfect, such as DCs, as well as demonstrate the possibility of silencing IDO1 gene to overcome the immunosuppressive barrier imposed by the TME for cancer therapy.

Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast the T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. By exploring a broad class of feedback-controller designs as potential immune programs, we demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. Notably, we find that designs that balance harm from acute infections and autoimmunity produce immune responses consistent with experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens ("quality") and the abundance ("quantity") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for more robust T-cell therapies.">

        <tr id="B cell is a crucial component of adaptive immunity that plays a paramount role in the progression and prognosis of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, detailed and systematic overviews of B cells are lacking, hindering their clinical applications in fighting against HBV. This study aims to provide a landscape of B cell responses in the context of chronic HBV infection. The phenotype, function, and transcriptome features of the peripheral and intrahepatic B cells in cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of patients with chronic HBV infection were characterized using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis coupled with flow cytometry. B cells displayed varying degrees of altered function at different natural stages of chronic HBV infection, as evidenced by their inhibitory phenotype, reduced B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, resulting in decreased production of antiviral cytokines, attenuated differentiation into memory B cells, weakened interactions with T cells. Additionally, in patients with chronic HBV infection, intrahepatic B cells exhibited augmented BCR signaling, cytokine secretion, differentiation, and intensified interactions with other immune cells, compared to their peripheral counterparts. It is noteworthy that CCR7+ B cells, characterized by high expression of activation markers and IL-6, exhibited enhanced survival capacity and were elevated in treatment-responsive patients. Our study provides a detailed insight into the B cell response in chronic HBV infection and highlights the potential clinical application of CCR7-expressing B cell-oriented anti-HBV therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) has been characterized as being amongst the most immune infiltrated solid tumors with a highly heterogenous immune landscape. Within spatially organized cellular networks (CNs) of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), key immune cell-cell interactions (CCIs) impact immune cell function and organization ultimately impacting the patient’s overall response. Multiple studies have observed an association of tertiary lymphoid structures, a commonly observed spatial CN, with positive clinical outcomes in RCC, however additional CNs and the CCIs that control these networks need to be identified to better harness and potentially reprogram immune responses to improve patient outcomes. The recent explosion of interest in the heterogeneity of the immune landscape in RCC has led to numerous publications using the latest technologies in spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. However, many of these studies use this data in isolation and therefore, may be hindered by the technological biases inherent in each method. Here, we have developed a novel approach to integrate spatial and single cell multi-omic data harnessing the strengths of each technology to better interrogate CNs that exist in the RCC TIME. Methods Fresh surgical samples were procured at the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada) through the REnal cancer MicroEnvironment DiscoverY (REMEDY) study. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single cell suspension mass cytometry (SMC), whole transcriptome digital spatial profiling (DSP), and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) was performed on spatially concordant tumor regions across 54 patients. scRNA-seq enabled the identification of immune, stromal, and malignant high-resolution cell states, which informed a tailored antibody panel design for SMC and IMC and served as a reference framework for harmonized cell-type annotation across modalities. This enabled the integration of our transcriptomic and proteomic data to delineate RCC-specific CNs enriched for defined CCIs across unique biological pathways. Results Using this integrative approach, we identified seven high-resolution patient immunophenotypes. To evaluate their prognostic and predictive relevance, we derived representative gene signatures using a linear mixed model (Flash-MM) to interrogate publicly available bulk RNA-seq datasets, including TCGA, JAVELIN, and IMmotion151. This analysis revealed immunophenotype-specific associations with survival following surgery or systemic therapy in univariate models. To explore potential biological mechanisms associated with these divergent clinical outcomes, we incorporated spatial information into traditional CCI analyses and performed pathway analyses to define functional relationships. This revealed that patient subtypes with high lymphoid infiltration exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity, potentially reflecting the coexistence of multiple activated immune pathways. In contrast, patient subtypes with low immune infiltration were enriched in more developmental signaling pathways. In addition to our biological observations, we were also able to assess the technological differences between patient matched samples and compare the ability of each technology to capture inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity. Conclusions Collectively, this work identifies clinically distinct subgroups defined by CNs and details the interpatient cellular heterogeneity that exists in RCC, providing the foundation for future personalized therapeutic interventions against this disease.">

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) disproportionately affects Black women, who face higher rates of aggressive disease and poorer outcomes. While tumor-intrinsic features have been studied, less is known about how immune surveillance and lymph node (LN) architecture differ by ethnicity. Anti-tumor immune responses typically begin in LNs through antigen presentation to naïve immune cells and executed by effector cells that circulate to and infiltrate tumors. We hypothesized that Black and White TNBC patients exhibit divergent immune signatures across both compartments. We first analyzed a retrospective cohort of 116 White, and 51 Black early-stage TNBC patients. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were extracted to assess systemic immune status. Black patients showed lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; median 1.61 vs 2.71, p<0.0001), consistent with ancestry-associated benign neutropenia. We next prospectively profiled immune signatures in early-stage TNBC patients. PBMCs from 55 patients (38 White, 17 Black) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum from 33 patients (20 White, 13 Black) was profiled using Olink proteomics, and 12 PBMCs by LC-MS. Immune profiling revealed coordinated alterations in both effector and antigen-presenting cell compartments (all padj<0.05). Black patients had increased NK cells, particularly within the cytotoxic CD56dim and NKG2D+ subsets, and elevated dendritic cells skewed toward cross-presenting cDC1 subset. CD8+ T cells displayed reduced PD-1 expression and increased frequencies of both TEMRA and NKG2D+ subsets, suggesting enhanced cytotoxic potential. Circulating CD4+ central memory T cells were reduced, while CXCR5+CD4+ and CD8+ CM cells were elevated, potentially reflecting altered LN trafficking in black patients. Serum analysis showed elevated CXCL1/3 and TNF-α/NFκB signaling. LC-MS proteomics further indicated a shift toward oxidative phosphorylation in Black patients, suggesting distinct metabolic programming that may influence effector function. To examine immune architecture, we analyzed H&E from 736 LNs (110 patients) and CD3/CD20 IHC from 414 LNs (90 patients). LN architecture was preserved across groups, but Black patients exhibited greater CD20+ B cell presence in uninvolved nodes, consistent with enriched germinal center-like features. CD3+ cells were higher in involved nodes of White patients (p<0.05). A subset of 26 LNs (15 White, 11 Black) underwent 21-plex PhenoCycler analysis (∼12M cells). In uninvolved LNs, CD20+ zones in White patients had more CD8+ T cells, while Black patients had more naïve B cells and FDC-associated B cells. In involved LNs, White patients showed more CD8+ infiltration, while Black patients had fewer tumor–CD8+ contacts and more FOXP3+CD8+cells. These findings reveal ethnicity-linked divergence in immune surveillance, with Black patients displaying altered clinical indices, enhanced circulating effector features, but reduced CD8+ cytotoxic engagement in tumor-involved LNs. These systemic and spatial patterns may contribute to TNBC outcome disparities.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a serious condition where cancer spreads throughout the lining of the abdominal cavity. It often occurs in late stages of cancers like ovarian, colon, or stomach cancer and is hard to treat. Patients with PC usually suffer from complications such as fluid buildup (ascites), bowel blockages, and poor nutrition, which severely impact quality of life and limit treatment options. This review focuses on a molecule called interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is part of the body’s immune system but also helps cancers grow and spread. IL-8 attracts immune cells like neutrophils that, instead of fighting the cancer, create an environment through its receptor CXCR1/CXCR2 signaling that helps tumors survive, invade new areas, and avoid immune attack. IL-8 also encourages inflammation, blood vessel growth to feed tumors, and scar tissue buildup that causes bowel obstruction. Blocking IL-8—either with specific antibodies or drugs that stop its action—has shown promise in early lab studies and clinical trials. These treatments may help reduce cancer spread, ease symptoms like ascites, and improve how well other cancer therapies work. Our review concludes that targeting IL-8 and its receptor CXCR1/CXCR2 is a promising new strategy for treating peritoneal carcinomatosis and could improve survival and quality of life for patients. More research is needed to confirm its benefits and develop combination treatments.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in adaptive immune responses; however, ex vivo differentiation strategies face operational complexities and reduced cellular viability. In situ reprogramming of resident cells into antigen-presenting cells represents a promising alternative approach for enhancing local immune responses. Methods: We initially introduce the novel concept of pseudo-DCs, in situ transforming intradermal fibroblasts into DC-like cells using an engineered exosome-loaded microneedle (MN) array. Specifically, engineered nano-protoplasts expressing interferon-beta (IFN-β) and loaded with varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (VZV gE) were used to stimulate DCs and derive immunostimulatory exosomes. These exosomes were integrated into a microarray-based delivery system for intradermal application. Results: The engineered exosomes (IdE@E) induced resident fibroblasts to upregulate DC surface co-stimulatory markers (CD80/86) and effectively present the model antigen. Transcriptome analysis also revealed significant upregulation of genes associated with immune response and antigen presentation in IdE@E-treated cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that MN array-delivered IdE@E effectively induced the expression of DC and activation markers from fibroblasts in dermis. Furthermore, MN array-delivered IdE@E significantly elevated the population of IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells in both lymph nodes and spleen, indicating enhanced local and systemic immune responses. Conclusions: This novel in situ reprogramming method represents a paradigm shift in precision immunotherapies, leveraging exosome-mediated cellular mimicry to enhance adaptive immunity without complete cellular transformation. This scalable framework holds significant promise for immunotherapy and could revolutionize personalized immunotherapy.">

Ad priming elicited robust type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate-like T cell activation, augmenting T cell responses (innate-to-adaptive signaling), which was dampened at boost by antivector immunity. Conversely, mRNA boosting enhanced innate-like responses, driven by prime-induced spike-specific memory T cell-derived IFN-γ (adaptive-to-innate signaling). Extending the dosing interval dampened inflammation at boost because of waning T cell memory. In a separate vaccine trial, preboost spike-specific T cells predicted severe mRNA reactogenicity regardless of the priming platform or interval. Overall, bidirectional innate-like and adaptive cross-talk, and IFN-γ-licensed innate-like T cells, orchestrate interval-dependent early vaccine responses, suggesting modifiable targets for safer, more effective regimens.">

Cancer’s ability to manipulate the immune system through tumor-induced immunosuppression
remains a significant challenge in oncology. The tumor microenvironment (TME)
employs various mechanisms, including the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, the secretion
of inhibitory cytokines, and metabolic reprogramming, to evade immune responses and
impair immunotherapies. Natural killer (NK) cells, a vital component of innate immunity, exhibit
potent anti-tumor activity. However, their function is often suppressed within the TME.
Recent advancements in genetic engineering have enabled the development of modified NK
cells with enhanced persistence, targeting, and cytotoxicity. Strategies such as chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)-NK cells, cytokine engineering, immune checkpoint blockade, and resistance to
TME factors have demonstrated promising potential in overcoming immunosuppression and
improving cancer therapy. This review explores the role of engineered NK cells in counteracting
tumor-mediated immune evasion, current clinical advancements, and future directions in
NK cell-based immunotherapy. While challenges such as in vivo persistence, scalability, and
off-target effects remain, engineered NK cells offer a promising avenue for enhancing cancer
treatment efficacy. This review aims to synthesize advancements in engineered NK cell therapies
to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression.

        <tr id="Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors of glial origin accounting for about 80% of the central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. Glioma cells are known to form a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) capable of inhibiting T cell activation and protecting tumors from elimination by the immune system. One of the predominant immune inhibitory mechanisms in the TME are immune checkpoints: a complex system of membrane-bound ligands on tumor and immune cells that interact with surface receptors on T lymphocytes and affect their activation and cytotoxicity. There is mounting evidence regarding the role of immune checkpoints expressed in gliomas, in particular, their most aggressive form – glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this review, we discuss the immune checkpoints with proven expression in gliomas, their ligands, related signaling pathways, co-expression profiles, and the effects of immune cells on antitumor activity. We collected data not only on the canonical immune checkpoints (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4) but also on novel and alternative ones including soluble mediators and enzymes. We review data describing the correlation of immune checkpoint expression with patient survival as well as co-expression with other molecules involved in glioma development. Where possible, we analyzed the differences between immune checkpoints in low-grade (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG). Negative effects of several immune checkpoints on T cells could be eliminated by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between checkpoint ligands and receptors. Therefore, alongside with traditional approaches and T cell-based immunotherapy, the antibody-mediated blockade of immune checkpoints could be considered as a potentially promising therapeutic approach against gliomas.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material-based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self-marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen-presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long-term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.">

        <tr id="The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains challenging, largely due to high relapse rates following standard therapies. T-cell engagers (TCEs) offer a promising immunotherapeutic approach by redirecting T cells to recognize and kill AML cells. These therapeutic proteins bind CD3 to T cells and a tumor-associated antigen to AML cells, facilitating targeted immune activation. While CD33 and CD123 are the most commonly targeted AML antigens, others such as CD135, CD38, and CLEC12A/CLL-1 are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies. In parallel, various TCE formats—including BiTEs, DuoBodies, DARTs, and DARPin-based constructs—have been developed to optimize pharmacokinetics, stability, and immune engagement. Despite the growing number of TCEs entering clinical evaluation, none have advanced beyond early Phase (I/II) trials, primarily due to the lack of optimal target antigens and challenges in balancing antileukemic activity with the risks of immune-related toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This review aims to summarize the current landscape of TCE development in AML, highlighting key targets, formats, and challenges.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disorder due to the abnormal proliferation of clonal Plasma Cells (PCs) characterized by the increase of monoclonal immunoglobulins1. The interaction between MM cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is crucial to the progression and treatment of the disease. The PCs interaction with the hematopoietic cells induce the secretion of cytokines and growth factors, by establishing circuits that support PCs activation. In this context the malignant TIGIT positive PCs are able to interact with the T lymphocytes, a process that fuel the immune evasion, typical of the MM2. Our knowledge about the BM myeloma microenvironment is still poorly defined as well as the cellular interaction between PCs. We exploited BM biopsies of 22 MM patients. TIGIT was expressed in 86% (19/22) of evaluable samples. Among patients with PCs % >60% or FLC ratio >100, 92% were TIGIT+. Morphological differences were evident between groups: TIGIT-negative PCs were larger and altered, while TIGIT-positive PCs showed polarized nuclei and proximity to neutrophils. TIGIT-positive samples displayed increased neutrophils undergoing NETosis, as confirmed by neutrophil elastase and Ly6b co-expression (p=0.0067). Elevated IL-6 (p=0.0003) and IL-8 (p=0.004) in TIGIT-positive samples suggest a proinflammatory microenvironment promoting neutrophil recruitment and NETosis. In MM, the Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio combines a marker of inflammation and the reduced cell turnover, reflecting alteration in the immune system. TIGIT expression in the bone marrow of MM patients is associated with more aggressive disease features and an inflammatory microenvironment enriched with NET-forming neutrophils. These findings support TIGIT as a potential biomarker of disease severity and a therapeutic target in MM.">

        <tr id="Based on previous studies on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells in patients with primary membranous nephropathy (PMN), we successfully established a murine PMN model to investigate the relationship between MDSCs, T cells, and disease progression. Our study demonstrated that MDSCs and their subclasses, as well as Th17 and T helper 2 (Th2) immune responses, were enhanced. In contrast, the proportion of T helper 1 (Th1) and regulatory T (Treg) cells decreased with PMN progression. Depletion of MDSCs with gemcitabine reduced the proportion of Th17 and Th2 cells and the expression of related transcription factors. Conversely, the proportions of Th1 and Treg cells increased in the circulation, spleen, lymph nodes, and kidneys, alleviating the clinical manifestations and pathological damage to the renal tissue in PMN model mice. These findings suggest that MDSCs, along with Th17 and Th2 responses, play critical roles in PMN progression. MDSCs may contribute to disease progression by regulating the differentiation and immune response of T-cell subclasses. The data provide new insights into the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of membranous nephropathy.">

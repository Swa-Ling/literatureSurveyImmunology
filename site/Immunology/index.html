        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Immune cells from the adaptive and innate immune systems coexist in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) to mediate tumor cell immunosurveillance and prevent tumor relapse. Relapse-free survival after surgical resection is heterogeneous in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Yet, little is known about the composition and spatial organisation of the TME that could explain the different prognoses for lung cancer patients. Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells. TNFα signaling was activated in tumors with high infiltration of CD14+CD4+ T cells in the tumor core. Our results demonstrate that innate immune cells impact adaptive immune cell activity to support the deployment of discrete T cell populations with anti-tumor activity.">

        <tr id="Somatic mutations inactivating TET2 are among the most common drivers of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). While TET2 inactivation is associated with monocyte-derived inflammation and improved chimeric antigen-receptor-T cell function, its impact on immunotherapy response is unknown. In our mouse model, hematopoietic Tet2 mutation enhanced immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. Enhanced ICB response with Tet2 mutation required phagocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, in Tet2-mutant tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), ICB preferentially induced anti-tumor states and restricted cell states linked to tumor progression. Tet2-mutant monocytes activated costimulatory programs, while Tet2-mutant T cells showed enhanced T cell memory signatures, lesser exhaustion and decreased regulatory phenotype. Our murine data was clinically relevant, since we found that melanomas from patients with TET2 driver mutation-CH (TET2-CH) showed enhanced immune infiltration, T cell activation, and T cell memory programs. In melanoma patients treated with ICB, TET2-CH was associated with 6-fold greater odds of clinical benefit. Collectively, our data establishes that hematopoietic Tet2 inactivation primes leukocytes for anti-tumor states associated with immunotherapy response and provides a potential biomarker for personalized therapy.">

        <tr id="During homeostasis, innate and epithelial cells undergo continuous maturation, shaped by microbial, molecular and cellular interactions. While these cells influence adaptive immunity during steady-state conditions, the reciprocal homeostatic role of adaptive immune cells in the maturation and function of innate and epithelial cells remains underexplored. Here, through computational approaches and murine models, we establish that adaptive immunity shapes innate immune and epithelial homeostatic landscapes. Mechanistically, adaptive immunity acts as a brake on type 1 polarization and diversification of innate lymphocytes (ILCs). Without adaptive immunity, the innate cellular interactions within the mesenteric lymph nodes are dominated by an interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signaling network. Moreover, the innate immune and epithelial cells follow distinct phenotypic and functional trajectories, including ILCs acquiring myeloid markers, monocytes adopting an inflammatory path, and colonic epithelial cells expressing altered antimicrobial peptides and losing Paneth-like features. Depleting ILCs, abolishing IFNγ signaling, or restoring adaptive immunity reduces these IFNγ-driven changes. Thus, our findings highlight a homeostatic function of adaptive immunity in modulating innate and epithelial cell communication, diversity, composition, function, and differentiation, notably by limiting ILC-derived IFNγ.">

Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) presented clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Lack of ICI efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells that create the “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) impeding infiltration and activation of effector T cells. We developed a designer RGD peptide that hindered glioma-instigated, integrin-mediated pro-tumoral reprogramming of myeloid cells and blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in co-cultures in vitro. Intratumorally-delivered RGD alone did not reduce glioma growth in syngeneic mice but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and led to peritumoral blood vessels normalization. Furthermore, combining RGD with immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade reduced tumor growth, led to upsurge of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depleted regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. RGD modified the phenotypes of myeloid cells in human gliomas in nude mice. Thus, combining the integrin blockade with ICI reinvigorates antitumor immunity and paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.">

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated durable responses in various cancer types, a significant proportion of patients do not exhibit favourable responses to these interventions. To uncover potential factors associated with a positive response to immunotherapy, we established a bilateral tumor model using P815 mastocytoma implanted in DBA/2 mice. In this model, only a fraction of tumor-bearing mice responds favourably to anti-PD-1 treatment, thus providing a valuable model to explore the influence of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in determining the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based immunotherapies. Moreover, this model allows for the analysis of a pretreatment tumor and inference of its treatment outcome based on the response observed in the contralateral tumor. Here, we demonstrated that tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell clones expressing high levels of Tim-3 were associated to a positive anti-tumor response following anti-PD-1 administration. Our study also revealed distinct differentiation dynamics in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in responding and non-responding mice. An IFNγ-enriched TME appeared to promote the differentiation of monocytes into PD-L1pos MHC IIhigh cells in mice responding to immunotherapy. Monocytes present in the TME of non-responding mice failed to reach the same final stage of differentiation trajectory, suggesting that an altered monocyte to macrophage route may hamper the response to ICB. These insights will direct future research towards a temporal analysis of TAMs, aiming to identify factors responsible for transitions between differentiation states within the TME. This approach may potentially pave the way to novel strategies to enhance the efficacy of PD-1 blockade.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The main challenge against patients with cancer to derive benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 appears to be the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), in which IL-33/ST2 signal fulfills critical functions. However, whether IL-33 limits the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 remains uncertain. Methods Molecular mechanisms of IL-33/ST2 signal on anti-PD-L1 treatment lewis lung carcinoma tumor model were assessed by RNA-seq, ELISA, WB and immunofluorescence (IF). A sST2-Fc fusion protein was constructed for targeting IL-33 and combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody for immunotherapy in colon and lung tumor models. On this basis, bifunctional fusion proteins were generated for PD-L1-targeted blocking of IL-33 in tumors. The underlying mechanisms of dual targeting of IL-33 and PD-L1 revealed by RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, FACS, IF and WB. Results After anti-PD-L1 administration, tumor-infiltrating ST2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were elevated. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signal with sST2-Fc fusion protein potentiated antitumor efficacy of PD-L1 antibody by enhancing T cell responses in tumor models. Bifunctional fusion protein anti-PD-L1-sST2 exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy compared with combination therapy, not only inhibited tumor progression and extended the survival, but also provided long-term protective antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the superior antitumor activity of targeting IL-33 and PD-L1 originated from reducing immunosuppressive factors, such as Tregs and exhausted CD8+ T cells while increasing tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that IL-33/ST2 was involved in the immunosuppression mechanism of PD-L1 antibody therapy, and blockade by sST2-Fc or anti-PD-L1-sST2 could remodel the inflammatory TME and induce potent antitumor effect, highlighting the potential therapeutic strategies for the tumor treatment by simultaneously targeting IL-33 and PD-L1.">

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

Although the recruited MDMs became quickly and preferentially infected with Mtb, CD4+ T cells rapidly disinfected the MDMs. Clearance of Mtb from MDMs was not explained by IFN-γ, but rather by MHCII-mediated cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells.

        <tr id="Therapies that harness the immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells have revolutionized cancer care. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumor immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients, yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Epithelial and immune cells have long been appreciated for their contribution to the early immune response after injury; however, much less is known about the role of mesenchymal cells. Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing, we defined changes in gene expression associated with inflammation at 1-day post-wounding (dpw) in mouse skin. Compared to keratinocytes and myeloid cells, we detected enriched expression of pro-inflammatory genes in fibroblasts associated with deeper layers of the skin. In particular, SCA1+ fibroblasts were enriched for numerous chemokines, including CCL2, CCL7, and IL33 compared to SCA1-fibroblasts. Genetic deletion of Ccl2 in fibroblasts resulted in fewer wound bed macrophages and monocytes during injury-induced inflammation with reduced revascularization and re-epithelialization during the proliferation phase of healing. These findings highlight the important contribution of deep skin fibroblast-derived factors to injury-induced inflammation and the impact of immune cell dysregulation on subsequent tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to have a poor prognosis due to its ability to relapse following initial response to chemotherapy. While immunotherapies hold the promise to revolutionize cancer treatment, AML has been particularly challenging to target. It is therefore important to better understand the relationship between AML cells and immune cells within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, where this disease grows. Here we focus on non-malignant BM macrophages, and using a combination of intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, transcriptomics and functional analyses we identify a subpopulation of immunomodulatory BM macrophages (IMMs) with a unique profile and function during AML progression. While the majority of macrophages are already being lost at early infiltration, IMMs are locally enriched. They are capable of efferocytosis and support AML growth through inhibition of T cells. Enrichment of IMMs in the BM of patients developing early relapse indicates that future development of interventions that target IMMs’ development and function may improve AML patients’ outcome.">

TNFSF13 is a cytokine important for B cell maturation and function, but roles for epithelial TNFSF13 and putative contribution to inflammatory bowel disease are poorly understood. We evaluated functional consequences of a novel monoallelic TNFSF13 variant using biopsies, tissue-derived colonoids and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived colon organoids. TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited a >50% reduction in secreted TNFSF13, increased epithelial proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids. Single cell RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation identified FAS as the predominant colonic epithelial receptor for TNFSF13. Imaging mass cytometry revealed an increase in epithelial-associated B cells in TNFSF13 variant colon tissue sections. Finally, TNFSF13 variant colonoids co-cultured with memory B cells demonstrated a reduction in the production of IgA+ plasma cells compared to control colonoid co-cultures. Our findings support a role for epithelial TNFSF13 as a regulator of colonic epithelial growth and epithelial crosstalk with B cells.

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who will progress to severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. In patients with overweight/obesity these signatures are exacerbated compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic capacity compared to non-SD. Furthermore, type-I Interferon signalling is downregulated in SD, suggesting defective virus-sensing mechanisms may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional “professional killer” T/NK-cells underpin dengue pathogenesis. Our findings pave the way for the evaluation of immunomodulatory therapies for dengue.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell–originated events prevent efficient antitumor immune response and limit the application of anti-PD1 checkpoint immunotherapy. We show that syndecan-1 (SDC1) has a critical role in the regulation of T cell–mediated control of tumor growth. SDC1 inhibition increases the permeation of CD8+ T cells into tumors and triggers CD8+ T cell–mediated control of tumor growth, accompanied by increased proportions of progenitor-exhausted and effector-like CD8+ T cells. SDC1 deficiency alters multiple signaling events in tumor cells, including enhanced IFN-γ–STAT1 signaling, and augments antigen presentation and sensitivity to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Combinatory inhibition of SDC1 markedly potentiates the therapeutic effects of anti-PD1 in inhibiting tumor growth. Consistently, the findings are supported by the data from human tumors showing that SDC1 expression negatively correlates with T cell presence in tumor tissues and the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our findings suggest that SDC1 inhibits antitumor immunity, and that targeting SDC1 may promote anti-PD1 response for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

To decipher the combinatory mode of action of TLR8 agonism and PD-1 blockade, we employed a unique, open-label, phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity clinical trial (NCT03906526) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T- cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients. This study provides key insights into the mode of action of TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade immune targeting in HNSCC patients.">

In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells suppress cellular and humoral immune responses via killing of T cells, resulting in diminished vaccine responses in mice and humans. Efforts to overcome this roadblock and achieve optimal immunity require an improved understanding of the molecular mediators facilitating NK cell-targeting of discrete subsets of CD4 T cells. We employed single-cell forensic victimology and CRISPR-Cas9 editing to delineate a transcriptional program uniquely responsible for the susceptibility of a subpopulation of CD4 T cells to perforin-dependent immunoregulation by NK cells. The unique vulnerability of these CD4 T cells relative to other subsets of CD4 T cells was not associated with a pattern of NK-cell-receptor ligand expression that would favor activation of NK cells. Instead, susceptible CD4 T cells were skewed toward follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation and exhibited intermediate expression of Klf2 and a related suite of KLF2-target genes (e.g. S1pr1) involved in cell migration and spatial positioning. NK-cell dependent suppression of the subset of Tfh exhibiting intermediate expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 was confirmed with single-cell proteomics. CRISPR targeting of KLF2 in CD4 T cells prevented suppression by NK cells. Thus, KLF2 regulation of spatial positioning of T cells is a key determinant of NK-cell immunoregulatory function and a possible target for strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Dysregulated T-cell immune response-mediated inflammation plays critical roles in the pathology of diverse liver diseases, but the underlying mechanism of liver immune homeostasis control and the specific therapies for limiting T-cell overactivation remain unclear. Methods: The metabolic changes in concanavalin A (ConA) mice and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients and their associations with liver injury were analyzed. The expression of purine catabolism nucleases (e.g., CD39 and CD73) on liver cells and immune cells was assessed. The effects of MCregs and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and the underlying mechanism were also explored. Results: Our findings revealed significant alterations in purine metabolism in ConA mice and AIH patients, which correlated with liver injury severity and therapeutic response. CD39 and CD73 were markedly upregulated on CD11b+Gr-1+ MCs under liver injury conditions. The naturally expanded CD39+CD73+Gr-1highCD11b+ MCreg subset during early liver injury effectively suppressed CD4+ T-cell hyperactivation and liver injury both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MCregs released CD73high EVs, which converted extracellular AMP to immunosuppressive metabolites (e.g., adenosine and inosine), activating the cAMP pathway and inhibiting glycolysis and cytokine secretion in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the mechanism controlling immune homeostasis during the early liver injury phase and highlights that MCreg or MCreg-EV therapy may be a specific strategy for preventing diverse liver diseases induced by T-cell overactivation.">

        <tr id="Atherosclerotic plaques are defined by the accumulation of lipids and immune cells beneath the endothelium of the arterial intima. CD8 T cells are among the most abundant immune cell types in plaque, and conditions linked to their activation correlate with increased levels of cardiovascular disease. As lethal effectors of the immune response, CD8 T cell activation is suppressed at multiple levels. These checkpoints are critical in dampening autoimmune responses, and limiting damage in cardiovascular disease. Endothelial cells are well known for their role in recruiting CD8 T and other hematopoietic cells to low and disturbed flow (LDF) arterial regions that develop plaque, but whether they locally influence CD8 effector functions is unclear. Here, we show that endothelial cells can actively suppress CD8 T cell responses in settings of chronic plaque inflammation, but that this behavior is governed by expression of the RNA-binding protein Embryonic Lethal, Abnormal Vision-Like 1 (Elavl1). In response to immune cell recruitment in plaque, the endothelium dynamically shifts splicing of pre-mRNA and their translation to enhance expression of immune-regulatory proteins including C1q and CD27. This program is immuno-suppressive, and limited by Elavl1. We show this by Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2-mediated deletion of Elavl1 (ECKO), and analysis of changes in translation by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP). In ECKO mice, the translational shift in chronic inflammation is enhanced, leading to increased ribosomal association of C1q components and other critical regulators of immune response and resulting in a ∼70% reduction in plaque CD8 T cells. CITE-seq analysis of the remaining plaque T cells shows that they exhibit lower levels of markers associated with T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, survival, and activation. To understand whether the immunosuppressive mechanism occurred through failed CD8 recruitment or local modulation of T cell responses, we used a novel in vitro co-culture system to show that ECKO endothelial cells suppress CD8 T cell expansion—even in the presence of wild-type myeloid antigen-presenting cells, antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and antigen. Despite the induction of C1q mRNA by T cell co-culture in both wild-type and ECKO endothelial cells, we find C1q protein abundantly expressed only in co-culture with ECKO cells. Together, our data define a novel immune-suppressive transition in the endothelium, reminiscent of the transition of T cells to T-regs, and demonstrate the regulation of this process by Elavl1.">

We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of multiple cancer types, however, these treatments only work for a proportion of patients and biomarkers to predict response are lacking. One correlate of response is the reinvigoration of a subset of CD8 T cells that have an exhausted phenotype and impaired functionality. In order to develop new therapies, reproducible models are required to identify candidate target genes that enables the reversal of key hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Here we describe the development of an in vitro model by chronically stimulating T cells with their cognate antigen and performed an in depth temporal phenotypic characterisation. This model recapitulates many of the critical hallmarks of exhaustion, including increased expression of canonical exhaustion surface markers, impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production, decreased release of cytotoxic granules, and metabolic alterations, including dysfunctional mitochondria. These exhaustion hallmarks were validated using an in vivo model and a gene signature identified which robustly define the shared in vitro and in vivo exhausted state. Critically, this signature is also observed in tumour infiltrating T cells from multiple human tumour types, validating the translational potential of this model for discovering and triaging new therapies.">

        <tr id="High-grade gliomas are a major health challenge with poor prognosis and high morbidity. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have emerged as promising therapeutic options for several malignancies yet show little efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) tumors. CD200 is a newly recognized immune checkpoint that modulates immune homeostasis. CD200 protein is expressed by a variety of cells, including immune cells and stromal cells, and is overexpressed by many tumors. The shedding of CD200 from tumor cells can create an immunosuppressive environment that dampens anti-tumor immunity by modulating cytolytic activity and cytokine expression both within and outside the tumor microenvironment (TME). While it is well-accepted that CD200 induces a pro-tumorigenic environment through its ability to suppress the immune response, we sought to determine the role of glioma-specific expression of CD200. We show that CD200 is expressed across glioma types, is shed from tumor cells, and increases over time in the serum of patients undergoing immunotherapy. Using CD200 knockout (KO) glioma models, we demonstrated that glioma cell-derived CD200 promotes tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Notably, CD200 KO gliomas are spontaneously rejected by their host, a process that required a fully functional immune system, including NK and T-cells. Moreover, we report that glioma-derived or brain-injected soluble CD200 contributes to the suppression of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Our work provides new mechanistic insights regarding CD200-mediated immunosuppression by gliomas.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has quickly risen to become the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. This is in part because of its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here, we investigated an immunotherapy approach combining delivery of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) innate immune agonists by lipid-based nanoparticle (NP) coencapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies, which can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other proinflammatory signaling pathways, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell–driven and type I interferon–mediated tumor regression and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models dependent on both tumor and host STING activation. STING and TLR4-mediated type I interferon signaling was also associated with enhanced natural killer and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC samples. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can orchestrate a coordinated type I interferon–driven innate and adaptive immune response with durable antitumor efficacy against PDAC. Combining MEK/CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING/TLR4 agonists leads to T cell–mediated control of pancreatic tumors in mice. Editor’s summary Unlike other tumor types, existing immunotherapies have not proven very successful for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), necessitating the development of additional approaches. Here, Chibaya et al. developed a combination therapy approach that included nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists, which stimulate the immune response, in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which promote senescence of tumor cells. The combination therapy induced robust antitumor immune responses that controlled tumor burden in implanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models. These data support further development of this potent combination therapy for PDAC. —Courtney Malo">

In a study of a perforin-deficient mouse model of HLH with a viral trigger, we aimed to determine if CD8+ T cell behaviour could be modulated by targeted interleukin (IL)-2 treatment. We observed a paradoxical benefit that contrasted with IL-2’s typical role in boosting T cell activity: targeted IL-2 delivery to CD8+ T cells led to reduced hyperinflammation and disease severity. Our results demonstrated that IL-2 induced exhaustion in overactive CD8+ T cells, thus mitigating hyperinflammation.

        <tr id="Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules are antigen presentation proteins and increased in post-mortem Parkinson’s disease (PD) brain. Attempts to decrease MHCII expression have led to neuroprotection in PD mouse models. Our group reported that a SNP at rs3129882 in the MHCII gene Human leukocyte Antigen (HLA) DRA is associated with increased MHCII transcripts and surface protein and increased risk for late-onset idiopathic PD. We therefore hypothesized that decreased MHCII may mitigate dopaminergic degeneration. During an ongoing α-synuclein lesion, mice with MHCII deletion in systemic and brain innate immune cells (LysMCre+I-Abfl/fl) displayed brain T cell repertoire shifts and greater preservation of the dopaminergic phenotype in nigrostriatal terminals. Next, we investigated a human cohort to characterize the immunophenotype of subjects with and without the high-risk GG genotype at the rs3129882 SNP. We confirmed that the high-risk GG genotype is associated with peripheral changes in MHCII inducibility, frequency of CD4+ T cells, and differentially accessible chromatin regions within the MHCII locus. Although our mouse studies indicate that myeloid MHCII deletion coinciding with an intact adaptive immune system is insufficient to fully protect dopamine neurons from α-synuclein-induced degeneration, our data are consistent with the overwhelming evidence implicating antigen presentation in PD pathophysiology.">

Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) belong to a continuous disease spectrum of myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory setting necessitating novel therapies. Natural killer (NK) cells from patients with myeloid malignancies display global dysfunction with impaired killing capacity, altered metabolism, and an exhausted phenotype at the single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In this study, we identified that this dysfunction was mediated through a cross-talk between NK cells and myeloid blasts necessitating cell-cell contact. NK cell dysfunction could be prevented by targeting the αvβ-integrin/TGF-β/SMAD pathway but, once established, was persistent because of profound epigenetic reprogramming. We identified BATF as a core transcription factor and the main mediator of this NK cell dysfunction in AML. Mechanistically, we found that BATF was directly regulated and induced by SMAD2/3 and, in turn, bound to key genes related to NK cell exhaustion, such as HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and CTLA4. BATF deletion enhanced NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism of NK immune evasion in AML manifested by epigenetic rewiring and inactivation of NK cells by myeloid blasts. This work highlights the importance of using healthy allogeneic NK cells as an adoptive cell therapy to treat patients with myeloid malignancies combined with strategies aimed at preventing the dysfunction by targeting the TGF-β pathway or BATF. BATF deletion prevents epigenetic rewiring and enhances the antitumor activity of NK cells in AML. Editor’s summary Patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often relapse after standard of care. To improve outcomes, Kumar et al. have investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in antitumor immunity against myeloid blasts and have identified global dysfunction of NK cells in these patients. They identified BATF as responsible for this dysfunction, and by knocking out BATF downstream of the TGF-β canonical pathway in NK cells, they were able to enhance NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. This has led to the initiation of a promising clinical trial using these TGFBR2 knockout NK cells against myeloid malignancies. —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key mediators of lung function and are potential targets for therapies during respiratory infections. TGFβ is an important regulator of AM differentiation and maintenance, but how TGFβ directly modulates the innate immune responses of AMs remains unclear. This shortcoming prevents effective targeting of AMs to improve lung function in health and disease. Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGFβ in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGFβ regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGFβ maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGFβ alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGFβ (+) and TGFβ (−) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists. Together, these data suggest that TGFβ modulates AM metabolic networks and innate immune signaling cascades to control inflammatory pathways in AMs.">

To date, it remains elusive how the duration of TN-DC interactions and integration of activation signals are controlled in vivo. Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses. In sum, our findings uncover that lymphoid stromal chemokines act as built-in “disruptors” of T cell-DC interactions for long-term preservation of TEFF functionality.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the regenerative force of the gut epithelium. Lgr5+-ISC have been shown to respond to changes in their microenvironment by coping with different metabolites, adapting to caloric changes, and recovering from injury and inflammation. However, how pathogenic bacteria affect adult stem cell regeneration and, as a consequence, the overall tissue adaption to infection has yet to be explored in depth. Here, we interrogated early Lgr5+ ISC responses to an enteric intracellular pathogen by profiling individual IECs from the mouse small intestine. Utilizing GFP-labeled Salmonella enterica, we isolated intracellular invaded cells to elucidate invasion programs of epithelial cell subsets. In particular, we identified a Salmonella-specific infection signature comprised of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including the Defensin gene family. Our findings demonstrate that Salmonella enterica targets differentiated Paneth, enterocytes, and stem/progenitor cells at these early stages of infection. In response, a rapid Lg5+ ISC-driven cellular remodeling to enterocyte and Paneth lineages expressing AMP genes is initiated to combat the intruders. Importantly, we uncovered an ISC differentiation program via inflammasome activation to protect the crypt environment, while eliminating infected stem cells from the overall stem cell pool. This novel Lgr5+ stem cell defense mechanism not only protects the gut epithelium from persistent bacterial infection but also promotes tissue regeneration. We propose epithelial remodeling to AMP-secreting cells as a novel innate immune response to handle different gut stresses mediated by Lgr5+ ISCs to maintain organizational principles of gut homeostasis and physiology.">

Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and a high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Age-related susceptibility to sepsis and endotoxemia is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system and the expansion of the visceral adipose as an immunological reservoir are underlying features. Macrophages from older organisms exhibit substantial changes, including chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, genomic remodeling and a dysfunctional, amplified inflammatory response upon new exposure to pathogen. However, the mechanisms by which old macrophages maintain their inflammatory phenotype during endotoxemia remains elusive. We previously identified Gdf3, a TGFβ superfamily cytokine, as a top-regulated gene by age and the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we demonstrate that endotoxemia increases inflammatory (CD11c+) ATMs in a Gdf3- dependent manner in old mice. Lifelong systemic or myeloid-specific deletion of Gdf3 leads to reduced endotoxemia- induced inflammation, with decreased CD11c+ ATMs and inflammatory cytokines, and protection from hypothermia. Moreover, acute blockade of Gdf3 using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, phenocopies old mice with lifelong Gdf3-deficiency. We show that GDF3 promotes the inflammatory phenotype in ATMs by phosphorylating SMAD2/3. Mechanistically, the differential chromatin landscape of ATMs from old mice with or without myeloid-driven Gdf3 indicates that GDF3- SMAD2/3 signaling axis shifts the chromatin accessibility of ATMs towards an inflammatory state during aging. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of SMAD3 with a specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3) mimics Gdf3 deletion. SIS3 reduces endotoxemia-mediated inflammation with fewer CD11c+ ATMs and less severe hypothermia in old, but not young mice, as well as reduced mortality. In human adipose tissue, age positively correlates with GDF3 level, while inflammation correlates with pSMAD2/3 level. Overall, these results highlight the importance of GDF3-SMAD2/3 axis in driving inflammation in older organisms and identify this signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating endotoxemia-related inflammation in the aged.">

We also found decreased histone deacetylase gene expression, increased MAP kinase gene expression, and increased accessibility at interferon-related gene promoter regions.

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem leading to permanently disfiguring skin lesions caused by Leishmania parasites. Lesion severity stems from an excessive host inflammatory response that prevents healing. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and translational responses of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during murine CL using historical single-cell RNA sequencing data combined with flow cytometry and in vivo puromycin incorporation to assess translational activity. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation pathways including MHC-I, MHC-II, and immunoproteasome transcripts in dermal LECs from Leishmania major-infected mice compared to naive controls. LECs also exhibited increased expression of guanylate binding proteins and interferon-inducible genes, indicative of immune activation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that LECs in leishmanial lesions displayed heightened translational activity relative to LECs from uninflamed ears, and LEC translational activity was highest in activated LECs. Furthermore, LEC translational activity exceeded that of other cell types within the lesion microenvironment. Validating the transcriptomic data, LECs in lesions expressed elevated MHC-II and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), supporting their potential role in antigen presentation. Functional assays using DQ-OVA confirmed that LECs from leishmanial lesions efficiently uptake and process antigens, highlighting their capability as antigen presenting cells in the inflamed dermal microenvironment. Overall, our study reveals the activation status of LECs in leishmanial lesions, shedding light on their potential role in shaping local immunity and inflammation in a variety of skin diseases.">

        <tr id="Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a clonal hematologic malignancy, originates from mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The mechanism sustaining the persistence of mutant stem cells, leading to leukemia development, remains elusive. In this study, we conducted comprehensive examination of gene expression profiles, transcriptional factor regulons, and cell compositions/interactions throughout various stages of tumor cell development in Ptpn11 mutation-associated JMML. Our analyses revealed that leukemia-initiating Ptpn11E76K/+ mutant stem cells exhibited de novo activation of the myeloid transcriptional program and aberrant developmental trajectories. These mutant stem cells displayed significantly elevated expression of innate immunity-associated anti-microbial peptides and pro-inflammatory proteins, particularly S100a9 and S100a8. Biological experiments confirmed that S100a9/S100a8 conferred a selective advantage to the leukemia-initiating cells through autocrine effects and facilitated immune evasion by recruiting and promoting immune suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the microenvironment. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of S100a9/S100a8 signaling effectively impeded leukemia development from Ptpn11E76K/+ mutant stem cells. These findings collectively suggest that JMML tumor-initiating cells exploit evolutionarily conserved innate immune and inflammatory mechanisms to establish clonal dominance.">

        <tr id="The intestinal immune system maintains a balance between active immunity needed for protection and tolerance towards harmless antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) found in the intestinal mucosa are key to the adaptive arm of these immunoregulatory events. DCs sample antigens in the tissue and then migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime the T cells that then migrate back to the tissue as effector or regulatory cells. Intestinal DC are highly heterogeneous, and it remains unclear exactly which subsets induces the different kinds of immune response, or what signalling molecules and cellular mechanisms are involved. Here, we have studied these issues using Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) infection in mice, a model which is uniquely suited to dissecting this regulatory circuit in the gut, where it drives type 2 protective immunity at the same time as inhibiting other aspects of the immune response. Here, we characterise intestinal DC during Hpb infection for the first time. We observed a dynamical change of intestinal DC populations throughout the course of infection that correlated with altered phenotype and function. In particular, Hpb infection saw a rise in a population of CD103+ DC2 that retained a potent ability to drive Tregs during the infection and unlike CD103-DC2, had a reduced ability to induce pro-inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that TGFβ signalling may be responsible for some of the changes observed. This was confirmed in vitro, where supplementation TGFβ or Hpb-produced TGFβ mimic (TGM) replicated the immunomodulatory effects seen in DCs in vivo. Together, these results present a mechanistic explanation of how helminths such as Hpb may modulate host immune responses by altering the differentiation and function of local DCs. Furthermore, our work provides the basis for understanding immune homeostasis in the intestine at the molecular and cellular levels. Thus, this work fills out a crucial gap in our knowledge of basic biology underlining the DC decision between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response in the central circuit of adaptive immune response.">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

        <tr id="CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to maintain peripheral self-tolerance and suppress immune responses to tumors. Their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with poor clinical outcome in several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC). However, the properties of intratumoral Tregs remain largely unknown. Here, we found that a functionally distinct subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, which express the Foxp3 splicing variant retaining exon 2 (Foxp3E2), is prominent in the TME and peripheral blood of hormone receptor- positive (HR+) BC subjects with poor prognosis. Notably, a comprehensive examination of the Tumor Cell Genome Atlas (TCGA) validated Foxp3E2 as an independent prognostic marker in all other BC subtypes. We found that FOXP3E2 expression underlies BCs with highly immune suppressive landscape, defective mismatch repair and a stem-like signature thus highlighting pathways involved in tumor immune evasion. Finally, we confirmed the higher immunosuppressive capacity of BC patients-derived Foxp3E2+ Tregs by functional assays. Our study suggests Foxp3E2+ Tregs might be used as an independent biomarker to predict BC prognosis and recurrence, and to develop super-targeted depletion-based immunotherapies. One-sentence summaries Foxp3E2+ Treg enrichment reflects an increased tumor-immune suppression and predicts prognosis and recurrence in breast cancer.">

The TLR pathway is an attractive actively studied target pathway. Because of their strong immunostimulatory activity, TLRs are thought to be a “double-edged sword” for systemic treatment, even in the cancer field. To solve this, we have developed dextran-based TAM targeting activating conjugate (D-TAC) technology, which successfully uses tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to deliver the TLR7 agonist DSP-0509. We used low molecular weight dextran to target CD206 high M2-type macrophages, activate them, and induce a change in phenotype to antitumor M1-type macrophages with rapid clearance from the body and astonishing antitumor activity. We also demonstrated that the antitumor effect of our best drug candidate 5DEX-0509R is dependent on the abundance of TAMs, which is consistent with their mechanism of action. We believe that 5DEX-0509R generated by D-TAC technology can be a clinically applicable immunotherapy targeting the TLR signaling pathway.">

        <tr id="Objective: Investigating the interaction between Mast cells (MCs) and Mononuclear Phagocytes (MPs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of blader cancer (BCa) to uncover potential immunotherapeutic targets. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was conducted on 12 BCa patients to identify distinct subgroups of MCs and MPs. Transcriptome data was analyzed to characterize the phenotype, gene enrichment, cell-cell communication, and biological processes. The expression levels of cytokines were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while the chemotactic effects of cytokines were evaluated through Transwell assay. Results: In muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), the proportion of interferon-stimulated MC subtype (Mast-ISG15) increased. Mast-IL13 subgroup and Mast-CCL2 subgroups were functionally enriched in interferon (IFN) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. The Mast-CCL2 subgroup overexpressed the CCL2 gene, which could chemoattract MPs through CCL2. In vitro experiments confirmed that under stimulation, activated MCs activated IFN and NF-κB signaling, increasing the secretion of CCL2 and IL-13, chemoattracted THP-1 monocyte. Conclusion: This study revealed the vital role of MCs in shaping the TME of BCa. And provides new insights for the precise treatment of BCa.">

This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="Background Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a serious liver disease characterized by immune disorders, particularly effector T-cell overactivation. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (MSC-EV) treatment on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and liver injury in AIH. Methods The metabolic changes of CD4+ T cells were assayed in human AIH and mouse hepatitis models. The liver protective effect of MSC-EVs was evaluated by transaminase levels, liver histopathology and inflammation. The effect of MSC-EVs on the metabolic state of CD4+ T cells was also explored. Results Enhanced glycolysis (eg, ~1.5-fold increase in hexokinase 2 levels) was detected in the CD4+ T cells of AIH patient samples and mouse hepatitis models, whereas the inhibition of glycolysis decreased CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.8-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and AIH liver injury (~6-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EV treatment reduced CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.5-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and cytokine release (~5-fold decrease in IFN-γ levels) by reducing glycolysis (~3-fold decrease) while enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (~2-fold increase in maximal respiration) in such cells. The degree of liver damage in AIH mice was ameliorated after MSC-EV treatment (~5-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EVs carried abundant mitochondrial proteins and might transfer them to metabolically reprogram CD4+ T cells, whereas disrupting mitochondrial transfer impaired the therapeutic potency of MSC-EVs in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusion Disordered glucose metabolism promotes CD4+ T-cell activation and associated inflammatory liver injury in AIH models, which can be reversed by MSC-EV therapy, and this effect is at least partially dependent on EV-mediated mitochondrial protein transfer between cells. This study highlights that MSC-EV therapy may represent a new avenue for treating autoimmune diseases such as AIH.">

However, Th2 responses are notably absent from known host-microbiota intestinal immune circuits. Notably, the commensal protist Tritrichomonas induces a transient innate ILC2 circuit rather than a chronic Th2 circuit. Canonical Th2 responses rely on the induction of IL-4 production by innate cells. This study shows that the absence of Tet2, a DNA demethylase, reprograms naïve T cells to autonomously produce IL-4 upon T cell receptor stimulation, bypassing the need for IL-4 from innate cells for Th2 differentiation. Loss of this checkpoint induces chronic Th2 responses to Tritrichomonas, associated with IL-25-dependent barrier dysfunction and increased susceptibility to allergic pathology in response to dietary antigens.

Single cell RNA-seq of blood monocytes from EAE and proteomics analysis of macrophages from CCR2:EMMP−/− mice revealed significant alterations in metabolic programs, particularly reduced glycolysis and elevated mitochondrial electron transport and fatty acid oxidation, which were linked to their reduced pro-inflammatory traits.

        <tr id="Abundant infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor stroma plays a pivotal role in inducing immune escape in pancreatic cancer (PC). Lactate serves as a direct regulator of macrophage polarization and functions, although the precise regulation mechanism remain inadequately understood. Our study revealed that PC cells promote macrophage polarization towards the M2d phenotype through high lactate secretion. M2d is characterized by elevated secretion of IL-10 and VEGF-A, which diminish CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity and promote tumor neoangiogenesis simultaneously. Additionally, we identify 2,5'-oligoadenylate synthase 3 (OAS3) as an essential regulator of M2d polarization, upregulated by PC cells via lactate/METTL3/OAS3 axis. METTL3 mediated m6A modification on OAS3 mRNA correlates with increased OAS3 expression in TAMs, which is associated with poorer prognosis in PC patients. OAS3 deficiency in macrophages substantially impairs IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d polarization and their pro-tumor functions while enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine (Gem) and anti-PD-L1 mAb in humanized mouse models. In conclusion, OAS3 presents as a promising immune therapeutic target for reversing IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d infiltration and restoring CD8+ T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer.">

        <tr id="Stem-like CD8+ T cells (TSL) are a subset of immune cells with superior persistence and antitumor immunity. They are TCF1+ PD-1+ and important for the expansion of tumor specific CD8+ T cells in response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. In acute infections, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector and memory CD8+ T cells; in cancer and chronic infections, persistent antigen stimulation can lead to T cell exhaustion. Recent studies have highlighted the dichotomy between late dysfunctional (or exhausted) T cells (TLD) that are TCF1– PD-1+ and self-renewing TCF1+ PD-1+ TSL from which they derive. TCF1+ TSL cells are considered to have stem cell-like properties akin to memory T cell populations and can give rise to cytotoxic effector and transitory T cell phenotypes (TTE) which mediate tumor control. In this review, we will discuss recent advances made in research on the formation and expansion of TSL, as well as distinct niches required for their differentiation and maintenance in the setting of cancer. We will also discuss potential strategies to generate these cells, with clinical implications for stemness enhancement in vaccine design, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and adoptive T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Biological processes such as aging, carcinogenesis, and immune response rely on the ability to maintain or rapidly expand cell populations. The fitness of the involved cells is constrained by their replicative potential, which is reflected in the cellular telomere content. Method We apply TelomereHunter to scATAC-seq data to determine telomere content on single-cell level, in a hematopoietic dataset consisting of 35,139 cells from samples of basal cell carcinoma patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade treatment. Integrating information from open-chromatin-based signatures to assess cell identity, we characterize the heterogeneity of telomere length for individual cell populations pre- and post-immunotherapy. Results The extracted telomeric reads reflect the expected telomereome-to-genome fraction. Telomere content distributions differ significantly between cell populations, and the median telomere content in intermediate and terminal exhausted CD8+ T-cells pre-treatment is significantly correlated to response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Likewise, telomere content correlates with post-treatment cell proliferation in terminally exhausted and T follicular helper cells from responding patients. Conclusion Telomere content measurement from scATAC-seq data has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to detect significant differences between cell types. Furthermore, the telomere content of CD8+ exhausted T-cells pre-treatment is a putative biomarker for successful PD-1-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Currently, there are no effective therapies for glioblastoma. Infiltrating myeloid cells contributes significantly to the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment that is characteristic of GBM. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells are chief immune suppressive cells found in the glioma microenvironment. Understanding the mechanisms of M-MDSC differentiation and T-cell suppression is imperative for generating therapies that target this tumor-supportive cell population. In this study, we found that glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands, M-CSF and IL-34, promote M-MDSCs to suppress CD8 T cells. These M-MDSCs partially utilize nitric oxide synthase to illicit their suppressive activity. However, spatial RNAseq points to glioma microenvironment niches driving M-MDSC heterogeneity. Our findings identify key regulators of differentiation and suppressive mechanisms of M-MDSCs and confirm the importance of targeting this cell population in glioma. Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, resulting in poor survival despite aggressive therapies. GBM is characterized by a highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) made up predominantly of infiltrating peripheral immune cells. One significant immune cell type that contributes to glioma immune evasion is a population of immunosuppressive cells, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Previous studies suggest that a subset of myeloid cells, expressing monocytic (M)-MDSC markers and dual expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1, utilize CCR2 to infiltrate the TME. This study evaluated the mechanism of CCR2+/CX3CR1+ M-MDSC differentiation and T cell suppressive function in murine glioma models. We determined that bone marrow-derived CCR2+/CX3CR1+ cells adopt an immune suppressive cell phenotype when cultured with glioma-derived factors. Glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands M-CSF and IL-34 were identified as key drivers of M-MDSC differentiation while adenosine and iNOS pathways were implicated in the M-MDSC suppression of T cells. Mining a human GBM spatial RNAseq database revealed a variety of different pathways that M-MDSCs utilize to exert their suppressive function that is driven by complex niches within the microenvironment. These data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of M-MDSCs in glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="Macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is widely used in clinical practice to treat respiratory tract infections and inflammatory diseases. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway. From a clinical perspective, this study also sheds light on potential clinical benefits observed in patients on prophylactic AZM regimens against various respiratory diseases and opens avenues for future adjunct therapy against Th1- and Tc1-dominated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="The thymus is the central organ involved with T-cell development and the production of naïve T cells. During normal aging, the thymus undergoes marked involution, reducing naïve T-cell output and resulting in a predominance of long-lived memory T cells in the periphery. Outside of aging, systemic stress responses that induce corticosteroids (CS), or other insults such as radiation exposure, induce thymocyte apoptosis, resulting in a transient acute thymic involution with subsequent recovery occurring after cessation of the stimulus. Despite the increasing utilization of immunostimulatory regimens in cancer, effects on the thymus and naïve T cell output have not been well characterized. Using both mouse and human systems, the thymic effects of systemic immunostimulatory regimens, such as high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) with or without agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs and acute primary viral infection, were investigated. These regimens produced a marked acute thymic involution in mice, which correlated with elevated serum glucocorticoid levels and a diminishment of naïve T cells in the periphery. This effect was transient and followed with a rapid thymic “rebound” effect, in which an even greater quantity of thymocytes was observed compared to controls. Similar results were observed in humans, as patients receiving HD IL-2 treatment for cancer demonstrated significantly increased cortisol levels, accompanied by decreased peripheral blood naïve T cells and reduced T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a marker indicative of recent thymic emigrants. Mice adrenalectomized prior to receiving immunotherapy or viral infection demonstrated protection from this glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution, despite experiencing a substantially higher inflammatory cytokine response and increased immunopathology. Investigation into the effects of immunostimulation on middle aged (7-12 months) and advance aged (22-24 months) mice, which had already undergone significant thymic involution and had a diminished naïve T cell population in the periphery at baseline, revealed that even further involution was incurred. Thymic rebound hyperplasia, however, only occurred in young and middle-aged recipients, while advance aged not only lacked this rebound hyperplasia, but were entirely absent of any indication of thymic restoration. This coincided with prolonged deficits in naïve T cell numbers in advanced aged recipients, further skewing the already memory dominant T cell pool. These results demonstrate that, in both mice and humans, systemic immunostimulatory cancer therapies, as well as immune challenges like subacute viral infections, have the potential to induce profound, but transient, glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution and substantially reduced thymic output, resulting in the reduction of peripheral naive T cells. This can then be followed by a marked rebound effect with naïve T cell restoration, events that were shown not to occur in advanced-aged mice.">

We found that human bone marrow Erythroid cells express the ARG1, LGALS1, LGALS3, LGALS9, and C10orf54 (VISTA) immunosuppressive genes, CXCL5, CXCL8, and VEGFA cytokine genes, as well as the genes involved in antimicrobial immunity and MHC Class II antigen presentation. We also found that ARG1 gene expression was restricted to the single erythroid cell cluster that we termed ARG1-positive Orthochromatic erythroblasts and that late Erythroid cells lose S100A9 and gain MZB1 gene expression in case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), infects approximately one-fourth of the world’s population. While most infected individuals are asymptomatic, latent TB infection (LTBI) can progress to cause pulmonary TB (PTB). We recently reported an increased accumulation of mast cells (MCs) in lungs of macaques with PTB, compared with LTBI in macaques. MCs respond in vitro to Mtb exposure via degranulation and by inducing proinflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we show the dominant production of chymase by MCs in granulomas of humans and macaques with PTB. Using scRNA seq analysis, we show that MCs found in LTBI and healthy lungs in macaques are enriched in genes involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha, cholesterol and transforming growth factor beta signaling. In contrast, MCs clusters found in PTB express transcriptional signatures associated with interferon gamma, oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC signaling. Additionally, MC deficiency in the mouse model showed improved control of Mtb infection that coincided with reduced accumulation of lung myeloid cells and diminished inflammation at chronic stages. Thus, these collective results provide novel evidence for the pathological contribution of MCs during Mtb infection and may represent a novel target for host directive therapy for TB.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, yet targeting them for therapeutic intervention has been discouraged due to the associated risk of infections. Thus, identification of neutrophil subsets and their involvement in inflammatory conditions is warranted for targeted therapeutic strategies. This study, through screening of surface proteins on neutrophils isolated from different tissue microenvironments, identified a distinct neutrophil subset, CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils, expressing Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). Interestingly, these Sca1pos neutrophils were more abundant in the liver than BM, blood, and lungs. Further analysis revealed that Sca1pos neutrophils are mature and activated with enhanced effector functions, including superoxide generation, phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. Tracing studies demonstrated ageing-independent characteristics of Sca1pos neutrophils. Remarkably, Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophils promote T cell proliferation through ROS, while inhibition of Sca-1 restores T cell proliferation and ROS generation. Intriguingly, inflammatory as well as metabolic cues induce the transition of conventional neutrophils (Sca1neg) to Sca1pos neutrophils and differentiation of progenitors (granulocyte monocyte progenitors, GMPs) into Sca1pos neutrophils. Furthermore, in vivo models of acute inflammation, peritonitis, and chronic inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exhibit an increase of Sca1pos neutrophils at inflammatory sites, while the pharmacological approach using NAC specifically mitigates the expansion of these pro-inflammatory neutrophils. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel subset of Sca1pos neutrophils with implications for inflammation. Significance Statement Neutrophilic inflammation remains the leading driver in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Targeting neutrophil populations remained un-recommended due to hampering the immunological functions of neutrophils. The heterogeneity of neutrophils provides the perspective to target altered neutrophil subsets, but subtle changes defining neutrophil subsets make it complex and ambiguous. Our study identified abundant expression of Sca1on distinct neutrophils under steady state and inflammation. Thus, we reported previously undefined Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophil subsets and elucidated their regulation. This study further established their involvement in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. This understanding may further pave the way toward targeting specific neutrophil subsets in pathologies characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. Graphical Abstract Highlights CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophil subset identified with <1% presence in BM and >40% frequency in the liver. These neutrophils are mature and activated, demonstrating enhanced effector functions. Sca1pos neutrophils promote T cell proliferation and display pro-inflammatory characteristics. Conventional Sca1neg neutrophils transition into Sca1pos neutrophils in response to inflammatory signals, while progenitors undergo differentiation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory models show the expansion of CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells often become dysfunctional during tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unclear. To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are routinely mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) to the blood circulation for clinical transplantation. However, the precise mechanisms by which individual stem cells exit the marrow are not understood. This study identified cell-extrinsic and molecular determinants of a mobilizable pool of blood-forming stem cells. We found that a subset of HSCs displays macrophage-associated markers on their cell surface. Although fully functional, these HSCs are selectively niche-retained as opposed to stem cells lacking macrophage markers, which exit the BM upon forced mobilization. Macrophage markers on HSCs could be acquired through direct transfer by trogocytosis, regulated by receptor tyrosine-protein kinase C-Kit (CD117), from BM-resident macrophages in mouse and human settings. Our study provides proof of concept that adult stem cells utilize trogocytosis to rapidly establish and activate function-modulating molecular mechanisms. Editor’s summary Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to red and white blood cells. They can be released from the bone marrow into the blood in low numbers during homeostasis or in greater numbers in response to infection and disease. Working with mouse and human cells, Gao et al. found that HSCs in the bone marrow could be distinguished by the expression of proteins associated with macrophages. These proteins were not produced within HSCs, but might be acquired from bone marrow–associated macrophages through a process of cell-cell membrane transfer that could be negatively regulated by signaling associated with the stem cell growth factor. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce all types of blood cells and ensure lifelong maintenance and replenishment of the hematopoietic system. These adult stem cells reside in a specialized microenvironment in the bone marrow (BM) yet show a distinctive behavior whereby a small fraction of their population continuously egresses from the BM to travel into blood circulation—a process termed “stem cell mobilization.” This property is harnessed in the clinic by enforcing HSC mobilization through pharmacological modulation of hematopoietic cytokine signaling through exposure to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) antagonists. Mobilized HSCs are harvested from the peripheral blood for subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, e.g., for treatment of patients with cancer, autoimmune, and other disorders. RATIONALE The mechanisms governing mobilization of individual HSCs into the blood are incompletely understood. Moreover, current therapeutic regimens fall short in stimulating BM egress of sufficient numbers of HSCs in a sizable proportion of patients. We therefore analyzed the proteins expressed on the surface of HSCs isolated from mice and investigated the mechanisms underlying the ability of most HSCs to be retained in BM while others can be mobilized. RESULTS We found that a large subset of HSCs displayed macrophage-associated markers, including F4/80 and CD169, on their cell surface. We assessed long-term regenerative multilineage repopulation capacity and the ability to mobilize from the BM upon forced mobilization or aging in HSCs expressing or not expressing macrophage markers. Macrophage marker–presenting HSCs were fully functional and largely retained in the BM, whereas stem cells without detectable macrophage-marker presentation readily exited the BM upon forced mobilization. Using in vitro cocultures of HSCs and macrophages, we discovered that HSCs could use trogocytosis (TROGPos HSCs)—a rapid and active transfer mechanism for surface molecules in which plasma membrane fragments are trafficked from one cell to another. Trogocytosis was impaired in the presence of stem cell factor. We therefore utilized genetic and pharmacological mouse models, as well as primary human cell–based assays, to trace how macrophage membrane material could be transferred onto HSCs. These efforts identified receptor tyrosine kinase C-Kit as a marker of stem cell trogocytosis and showed that HSCs with high C-Kit presentation on their cell surface could engage this mechanism to acquire CXCR4 from adjacent macrophages to increase stem cell retention in the niche. CONCLUSION We uncovered a definable pool of mobilizable stem cells and demonstrated that membrane-fragment transfer from macrophages could be functionalized by HSCs for BM retention. Our study provides proof of concept that adult stem cells can utilize trogocytosis to establish and activate function-modulating molecular mechanisms rapidly. These findings have implications for the development of more effective HSC mobilization strategies in the clinic, potentially through exploiting pharmacologic impairment of C-Kit. They will also spark efforts into delineating how much HSCs use trogocytosis to acutely gain function in other contexts, as well as the extent to which the hematopoietic system may use trogocytosis-mediated cell killing for eliminating defective stem cells. Model for C-Kit–dependent trogocytosis regulates niche retention in blood stem cells. A subset of HSCs (marked by high C-Kit expression) can acquire membrane material from adjacent macrophages through trogocytosis (TROGPos HSC) to augment retention in the bone marrow. Stem cells with low C-Kit expression are mobilized to the peripheral blood. ILLUSTRATION: TATYANA A. HARRIS FROM THE EINSTEIN CREATIVE SERVICES TEAM">

        <tr id="How group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate mucosal protection in the presence of T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we examined ILC3 function in intestinal immunity using ILC3-deficient mice that maintain endogenous T cells, T helper 17 (TH17) cells, and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were dispensable for generation of TH17 and TH22 cell responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and absence of ILC3s did not affect IL-22 production by CD4 T cells before or during infection. However, despite the presence of IL-22–producing T cells, ILC3s and ILC3-derived IL-22 were required for maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestinal epithelium. T cell–sufficient, ILC3-deficient mice were capable of pathogen clearance and survived infection with a low dose of Citrobacter rodentium. However, ILC3s promoted pathogen tolerance at early time points of infection by activating tissue-protective immune pathways. Consequently, ILC3s were indispensable for survival after high-dose infection. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent role for ILC3s in immune-sufficient animals and provide a blueprint for uncoupling of ILC3 and TH17 cell functions. In T cell–sufficient mice, ILC3s are required for mucosal protection from high-dose but not low-dose bacterial infection. Editor’s summary Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and immunity against gut pathogens. Distinguishing the functions of ILC3s from those of T helper 17 (TH17) cells has remained challenging because of similar transcription factor dependencies and cytokine production profiles. To better define ILC3-specific roles, Araujo et al. developed genetically engineered mice that lack ILC3s while retaining endogenous T cells and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were the primary producers of IL-22, which was required for the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Whereas TH17 cells were sufficient to protect against low-dose Citrobacter rodentium infection, ILC3s provided early protection and were required for survival after high-dose infection. Together, these findings identify nonredundant functions of ILC3s in mucosal homeostasis and immunity. —Claire Olingy">

However, limited information is available regarding the radiosensitivity of various hematopoietic cell populations in the bone marrow due to the high heterogeneity of the hematopoietic system. In this study, we observed that granulocyte–macrophage progenitors, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and B cells within the bone marrow showed the highest sensitivity, exhibiting a rapid decrease in cell numbers following irradiation. Nonetheless, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and dendritic cells demonstrated a certain degree of radioresistance, with neutrophils exhibiting the most pronounced resistance. By employing single-cell transcriptome sequencing, we investigated the early responsive genes in various cell types following irradiation, revealing that distinct gene expression profiles emerged between radiosensitive and radioresistant cells. In B cells, radiation exposure led to a specific upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, suggesting a connection between these complexes and cell radiosensitivity. In neutrophils, radiation exposure resulted in fewer gene alterations, indicating their potential for distinct mechanisms in radiation resistance. Collectively, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity of radiosensitivity among the various bone marrow hematopoietic cell populations.">

Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid malignancies arise in bone marrow microenvironments and shape these microenvironments in favor of malignant development. Immune suppression is one of the most important stages in myeloid leukemia progression. Leukemic clone expansion and immune dysregulation occur simultaneously in bone marrow microenvironments. Complex interactions emerge between normal immune system elements and leukemic clones in the bone marrow. In recent years, researchers have identified several of these pathological interactions. For instance, recent works shows that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), from bone marrow stromal cells contributes to immune dysregulation and the selective proliferation of JAK2V617F+ clones in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Moreover, inflammasome activation and sterile inflammation result in inflamed microenvironments and the development of myelodysplastic syndromes. Additional immune dysregulations, such as exhaustion of T and NK cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, and impairments in antigen presentation are common findings in myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the role of altered bone marrow microenvironments in the induction of immune dysregulations that accompany myeloid malignancies. We also consider both current and novel therapeutic strategies to restore normal immune system function in the context of myeloid malignancies.">

Mechanistically, this granulocyte-like monocyte population suppressed NK cell activity by inducing TIGIT and engaging NKp30. Accordingly, an increased frequency of TIGIT+ NK cells with impaired functions was found in both the PB and tumoral tissue of CRC pts. Collectively, we provided new mechanistic explanations for tumor immune escape occurring in CRC by showing the increase in this new kind of MDSC, in both PB and CRC tissue, which is able to significantly impair the effector functions of NK cells, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Adaptation to existence outside the womb is a key event in the life of a mammal. The absence of macrophages in rats with a homozygous mutation in the Csf1r gene (Csf1rko) severely compromises pre-weaning somatic growth and maturation of organ function. Transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning rescues tissue macrophage populations permitting normal development and long-term survival. To dissect the phenotype and function of macrophages in postnatal development, we generated transcriptomic profiles of all major organs of wild-type and Csf1rko rats at weaning and selected organs following rescue by BMT. The transcriptomic profiles revealed subtle effects of macrophage deficiency on development of all major organs. Network analysis revealed a common signature of CSF1R-dependent resident tissue macrophages that includes the components of complement C1Q (C1qa/b/c genes). Circulating C1Q was almost undetectable in Csf1rko rats and rapidly restored to normal levels following BMT. Tissue-specific macrophage signatures were also identified, notably including sinus macrophage populations in the lymph nodes. Their loss in Csf1rko rats was confirmed by immunohistochemical localisation of CD209B (SIGNR1). By 6-12 weeks, Csf1rko rats succumb to emphysema-like pathology associated with the selective loss of interstitial macrophages and granulocytosis. This pathology was reversed by BMT. Along with physiological rescue, BMT precisely regenerated the abundance and expression profiles of resident macrophages. The exception was the brain, where BM-derived microglia-like cells had a distinct expression profile compared to resident microglia. In addition, the transferred BM failed to restore blood monocyte or CSF1R-positive bone marrow progenitors. These studies provide a model for the pathology and treatment of CSF1R mutations in humans and the innate immune deficiency associated with prematurity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Throughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophage cluster is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation to CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present to naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Background: Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) maintain tissue homeostasis in response to microenvironmental perturbations. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key sensors for exogenous and endogenous signals produced during injury. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether TLRs affect the homeostatic functions of MSCs after injury. Methods: We examined the expression of TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 in MSCs, and analyzed the functional significance of TLR2 activation using single-cell RNA sequencing. Additionally, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of TLR2 and its downstream activation in MSCs on the MSCs themselves, on monocytes/macrophages, and in a mouse model of sterile injury-induced inflammatory corneal angiogenesis. Results: MSCs expressed TLR2, which was upregulated by monocytes/macrophages. Activation of TLR2 in MSCs promoted their immunoregulatory and angiostatic functions in monocytes/macrophages and in mice with inflammatory corneal angiogenesis, whereas TLR2 inhibition attenuated these functions. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed AKR1C1, a gene encoding aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1, as the most significantly inducible gene in MSCs upon TLR2 stimulation, though its stimulation did not affect cell compositions. AKR1C1 protected MSCs against ferroptosis, increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced their ability to drive monocytes/macrophages towards immunoregulatory phenotypes, leading to the amelioration of inflammatory corneal neovascularization in mice. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that activation of TLR2-AKR1C1 signaling in MSCs serves as an important pathway for the survival and homeostatic activities of MSCs during injury.">

        <tr id="In the previous studies, anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 bispecific antibody YM101 is demonstrated, with superior efficacy to anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in multiple tumor models. However, YM101 therapy can not achieve complete regression in most tumor-bearing mice, suggesting the presence of other immunosuppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME) beyond TGF-β and PD-L1. Thoroughly exploring the TME is imperative to pave the way for the successful translation of anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 BsAb into clinical practice. In this work, scRNA-seq is employed to comprehensively profile the TME changes induced by YM101. The scRNA-seq analysis reveals an increase in immune cell populations associated with antitumor immunity and enhances cell-killing pathways. However, the analysis also uncovers the presence of immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells in the TME after YM101 treatment. To overcome this hurdle, YM101 is combined with Maraviroc, a widely used CCR5 antagonist for treating HIV infection, suppressing CCR5+ T cell accumulation, and optimizing the immune response. Mechanistically, YM101-induced neutrophil activation recruits immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells via CCR5 ligand secretion, creating a feedback loop that diminishes the antitumor response. Maraviroc then cleared these infiltrating cells and offset YM101-mediated immunosuppressive effects, further unleashing the antitumor immunity. These findings suggest selectively targeting CCR5 signaling with Maraviroc represents a promising and strategic approach to enhance YM101 efficacy.">

        <tr id="Alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1) asymptomatically persists in its natural host, the wildebeest. However, cross-species transmission to cattle results in the induction of an acute and lethal peripheral T cell lymphoma-like disease (PTCL), named malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). Our previous findings demonstrated an essential role for viral genome maintenance in infected CD8+ T lymphocytes but the exact mechanism(s) leading to lymphoproliferation and MCF remained unknown. To decipher how AlHV-1 dysregulates T lymphocytes, we first examined the global phenotypic changes in circulating CD8+ T cells after experimental infection of calves. T cell receptor repertoire together with transcriptomics and epigenomics analyses demonstrated an oligoclonal expansion of infected CD8+ T cells displaying effector and exhaustion gene signatures, including GZMA, GNLY, PD-1, and TOX2 expression. Then, among viral genes expressed in infected CD8+ T cells, we uncovered A10 that encodes a transmembrane signaling protein displaying multiple tyrosine residues, with predicted ITAM and SH3 motifs. Impaired A10 expression did not affect AlHV-1 replication in vitro but rendered AlHV-1 unable to induce MCF. Furthermore, A10 was phosphorylated in T lymphocytes in vitro and affected T cell signaling. Finally, while AlHV-1 mutants expressing mutated forms of A10 devoid of ITAM or SH3 motifs (or both) were able to induce MCF, a recombinant virus expressing a mutated form of A10 unable to phosphorylate its tyrosine residues resulted in the lack of MCF and protected against a wild-type virus challenge. Thus, we could characterize the nature of this γ-herpesvirus-induced PTCL-like disease and identify an essential mechanism explaining its development.">

        <tr id="Background The ability of radiotherapy (RT) to drive anti-tumor immunity is limited by adaptive resistance. While RT induces inflammation and recruits activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), the resulting radiation- and IFNγ-dependent PD-L1 expression restores an immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment. Unleashing an effective anti-tumor response may require precise sequencing of RT and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) to block PD-L1 signaling before it can mediate its suppressive effects. Methods Flank tumors formed in BALB/c mice with syngeneic CT26 colon or 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells were treated with otherwise ineffective doses of ionizing radiation (10 Gy) followed by CBI (0.2 mg anti-PD-L1, i.v.) after 0, 1, 3, 5 or 7 days, comparing tumor response. Anti-PD-L1 delivery was measured by fluorescence, TILs by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and tumor size by calipers. Results In both CT26 and 4T1 tumors, 10 Gy alone resulted in a transient growth delay associated with infiltrating CTLs peaking at 3 days and PD-L1 at 5 days. CTLs returned toward baseline by 7 days, consistent with adaptive resistance. Anti-PD-L1 failed to potentiate radiation except when injected 5 days after 10 Gy, which prevented CTL depletion and led to tumor elimination. Potentially contributing to compound effects, anti-PD-L1 penetrated tumors and bound PD-L1 more efficiently after irradiation. Conclusions Optimal timing to exploit radiation-induced permeability to enhance CBI delivery and interrupt adaptive resistance by blocking PD-L1 as it peaks may offer a general strategy to enhance external beam radiotherapy by protecting activated TILs and potentiating anti-tumor immune response.">

        <tr id="In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pro-tumoral macrophages promote metastasis and suppress the immune response. To target these cells, we engineered a previously identified CD206 (mannose receptor)-binding peptide, mUNO, to enhance its affinity and proteolytic stability. The new rationally designed peptide, MACTIDE, includes a trypsin inhibitor loop, from the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor-I. Binding studies to recombinant CD206 revealed a 15-fold lower KD for MACTIDE compared to parental mUNO. Additionally, mass spectrometry showed a 5-fold increase in half-life in tumor lysate for MACTIDE compared to mUNO. Homing studies in TNBC-bearing mice showed that fluorescein (FAM)-MACTIDE precisely targeted CD206+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) upon intravenous, intraperitoneal and even oral administration, with no significant accumulation in liver. We coupled MACTIDE to the FDA-approved drug Verteporfin, an established photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy and inhibitor of the YAP/TAZ pathway, to generate a conjugate here referred to as MACTIDE-V. In the orthotopic 4T1 TNBC mouse model, non-irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice unexpectedly showed a similar anti-tumoral effect and fewer signs of toxicity as irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice, leading to subsequent studies on the laser-independent activity of this conjugate. In vitro studies using bone-marrow derived mouse macrophages showed that MACTIDE-V excluded YAP from the nucleus, increased the phagocytic activity and upregulated several genes associated with cytotoxic anti-tumoral macrophages. In mouse models of TNBC, MACTIDE-V slowed primary tumor growth, suppressed lung metastases, increased markers of phagocytosis and antigen presentation in TAMs and monocytes, increasing the tumor infiltration of several lymphocyte subsets. We therefore propose MACTIDE-V as a useful peptide-drug conjugate to modulate macrophage function in the context of breast tumor immunotherapy.">

Recent studies have revealed that soluble factors released in the TME by immune and non-immune cells, as well as by tumor cells themselves, contribute to the exacerbation of T cell exhaustion. Our understanding of the cytokine landscape of the TME, their interrelationships, and their impact on cancer development is still at its early stages. In this review, we aim to shed light on Interleukin (IL) -6, IL-9, and IL-10, a small group of JAK/STAT signaling-dependent cytokines harboring T cell-suppressive effects in the TME and summarize their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we will explore how advancements in scientific research can help us overcoming the obstacles posed by cytokines that suppress T cells in tumors, with the ultimate objective of stimulating further investigations for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract their tumor-promoting activities.">

        <tr id="Progress in cytokine engineering is driving therapeutic translation by overcoming these proteins' limitations as drugs. The interleukin-2 (IL-2) cytokine is a promising immune stimulant for cancer treatment but is limited by its concurrent activation of both pro-inflammatory immune effector cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, toxicity at high doses, and short serum half-life. One approach to improve the selectivity, safety, and longevity of IL-2 is complexation with anti-IL-2 antibodies that bias the cytokine towards immune effector cell activation. Although this strategy shows potential in preclinical models, clinical translation of a cytokine/antibody complex is complicated by challenges in formulating a multi-protein drug and concerns regarding complex stability. Here, we introduced a versatile approach to designing intramolecularly assembled single-agent fusion proteins (immunocytokines, ICs) comprising IL-2 and a biasing anti-IL-2 antibody that directs the cytokine towards immune effector cells. We optimized IC construction and engineered the cytokine/antibody affinity to improve immune bias. We demonstrated that our IC preferentially activates and expands immune effector cells, leading to superior antitumor activity compared to natural IL-2, both alone and combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, therapeutic efficacy was observed without inducing toxicity. This work presents a roadmap for the design and translation of cytokine/antibody fusion proteins.">

Alphavirus infection induces robust immune responses in infected hosts, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines, including chemokine C ligand 4 (CCL4). CCL4 is a chemoattractant for immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruiting these cells to the site of infection, stimulating the release of proinflammatory mediators, and inducing T cell differentiation. CCL4 has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of CCL4 in arthritogenic alphavirus disease development remains unexplored. Here, we tested the effect of CCL4 on MAYV infection in mice through antibody depletion and treatment with recombinant mouse CCL4. We observed no differences in mice depleted of CCL4 or treated with recombinant CCL4 in terms of disease progression such as weight loss and footpad swelling or the development of viremia. CCL4 uses the G protein-coupled receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). To determine whether CCR5 deficiency would alter disease outcomes or virus replication in mice, we inoculated CCR5 knockout (CCR5-/-) mice with MAYV and observed no effect on disease development and immune cell profile of blood and footpads between CCR5-/- and wild type mice. These studies failed to identify a clear role for CCL4 or its receptor CCR5 in MAYV infection.">

        <tr id="In sepsis, the liver functions as a central filter organ, where hepatic macrophages form a primary antimicrobial defense layer by eliminating bacteria and regulating immune responses. Therefore, precise regulation of the immune response in hepatic macrophages is crucial for triggering effective defense mechanisms. We aim to modulate the defense immune response by delivering transcription factor HIF1α, a key regulator of monocyte/macrophage reprogramming in sepsis. Transcription factors are promising candidates because they dynamically modulate gene expression across diverse conditions, though delivering them remains challenging. In this study, we suggest a novel method for loading HIF1α into extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance immune defense and resolve sepsis. By delivering HIF1α to macrophages during sepsis, we promoted the differentiation of Nr1h3-dependent pro-efferocytic MoMFs and C/ebpβ-dependent pro-survival MoMFs. Pro-efferocytic MoMFs eliminate damaged hepatocytes and immune cells and pro-survival MoMFs withstand inflammatory conditions and trigger innate memory responses. Particularly, the zonation of these macrophages in the periportal region ensures effective pathogen clearance and minimizes tissue damage. These findings suggest that EV-mediated HIF1α delivery could be a promising therapeutic option for managing sepsis.">

Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Simultaneous analysis of T cell receptor repertoire and T cell phenotype is of high relevance to gain a deeper understanding on the T cell response in terms of differentiation, kinetics and persistence. Also it is currently unknown how the repertoire of immune checkpoints on T cells evolves over time. To fully capture the heterogenous response, TCR repertoire and T cell phenotype analysis is preferably performed at the single-cell level, but this is costly and analytically challenging. Therefore, we developed a flow cytometry based method that allows for simultaneous characterization of the T cell TCR Vβ and the phenotype. We generated a 9-tube 24-color panel with antibodies against maturation and activation markers, and 24 TCR Vβ chains. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 5 healthy controls were analyzed, revealing the presence of oligoclonal expansions. Within the CD27+CD28+ memory T cell population, oligoclonal expansions were characterized by a T regulatory, or KLRG1+CCR7-CD27low phenotype. Within the late CD27- and/or CD28-memory T cells, the populations with the lowest TCR Vβ diversity expressed CX3CR1. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the dynamics of circulating oligoclonal T cell expansions that emerged following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the presence of CMV in 2 patients. We provide evidence that oligoclonal T cells transferred from donor to recipient can be traced up to at least 2.5 years while maintaining its phenotype. Mostly TIGIT and PD-1 were critical in defining T cell expansions, while CD45RA, CD57, CD56 and NKG2A were variably expressed. Overall, we developed a phenotype based method to trace T cell populations, that is widely applicable to different settings in which the T cell response needs to be monitored.">

        <tr id="The incidence and mortality of digestive system-related cancers have always been high and attributed to the heterogeneity and complexity of the immune microenvironment of the digestive system. Furthermore, several studies have shown that chronic inflammation in the digestive system is responsible for cancer incidence; therefore, controlling inflammation is a potential strategy to stop the development of cancer. Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC) represent a heterogeneous group of lymphocytes that exist in contrast to T cells. They function by interacting with cytokines and immune cells in an antigen-independent manner. In the digestive system cancer, from the inflammatory phase to the development, migration, and metastasis of tumors, ILC have been found to interact with the immune microenvironment and either control or promote these processes. The conventional treatments for digestive tumors have limited efficacy, therefore, ILC-associated immunotherapies are promising strategies. This study reviews the characterization of different ILC subpopulations, how they interact with and influence the immune microenvironment as well as chronic inflammation, and their promotional or inhibitory role in four common digestive system tumors, including pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular cancers. In particular, the review emphasizes the role of ILC in associating chronic inflammation with cancer and the potential for enhanced immunotherapy with cytokine therapy and adoptive immune cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T cells produce interferon gamma (IFNγ), which plays a critical role in anti-microbial and anti-tumor responses. However, it is not clear whether T cell-derived IFNγ directly kills infected and tumor target cells, and how this may be regulated. Here, we report that target cell expression of the kinases TBK1 and IKKε regulate IFNγ cytotoxicity by suppressing the ability of T cell-derived IFNγ to kill target cells. In tumor targets lacking TBK1 and IKKε, IFNγ induces expression of TNFR1 and the Z-nucleic acid sensor, ZBP1, to trigger RIPK1-dependent apoptosis, largely in a target cell-autonomous manner. Unexpectedly, IFNγ, which is not known to signal to NFκB, induces hyperactivation of NFκB in TBK1 and IKKε double-deficient cells. TBK1 and IKKε suppress IKKα/β activity and in their absence, IFNγ induces elevated NFκB-dependent expression of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Apoptosis is thought to be non-inflammatory, but our observations demonstrate that IFNγ can induce an inflammatory form of apoptosis, and this is suppressed by TBK1 and IKKε. The two kinases provide a critical connection between innate and adaptive immunological responses by regulating three key responses: (1) phosphorylation of IRF3/7 to induce type I IFN; (2) inhibition of RIPK1-dependent death; and (3) inhibition of NFκB-dependent inflammation. We propose that these kinases evolved these functions such that their inhibition by pathogens attempting to block type I IFN expression would enable IFNγ to trigger apoptosis accompanied by an alternative inflammatory response. Our findings show that loss of TBK1 and IKKε in target cells sensitizes them to inflammatory apoptosis induced by T cell-derived IFNγ. Short Summary In the absence of TBK1 and IKKε, target cells are killed by T cells in an IFNγ-dependent manner. In TBK1 and IKKε-deficient cells, IFNγ induces RIPK1-dependent death, as well as hyper-induction of NFκB-dependent inflammatory genes. This suggests that any inhibition of TBK1/IKKε to block type I IFN expression will result in the demise of the cell accompanied by an alternate inflammatory program. Graphical Abstract">

We monitored the effect of IL-27 neutralization on human macrophages and in vivo in a murine colon adenocarcinoma model. In this study, we demonstrated the importance of IL-27 in the generation of human immunoregulatory macrophages. Mechanistically, IL-27 neutralization reduced the immunosuppressive properties of macrophages. These modifications led to a reduction in the ability of macrophages to inhibit the function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of IL-27 reduced MC38 tumor growth. Collectively, we uncovered the role of IL-27 in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. IL-27 neutralization thus appears as a promising strategy to target macrophages in immunosuppressive TME and improve the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy protocols.">

There is no available licensed therapeutic vaccine that shortens active tuberculosis (TB) disease drug treatment and prevents relapse, despite the World Health Organization’s calls. Here, we show that an intranasal DNA vaccine containing a fusion of the stringent response relMtb gene with the gene encoding the immature dendritic cell-targeting chemokine, MIP-3α/CCL20, shortens the duration of curative TB treatment in immunocompetent mice. Compared to the first-line regimen for drug-susceptible TB alone, our novel adjunctive vaccine induced greater RelMtb-specific T-cell responses associated with optimal TB control in spleen, blood, lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. These responses were sustained, if not augmented, over time. It also triggered more effective dendritic cell recruitment, activation, and colocalization with T cells, implying enhanced crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, it potentiated a 6-month TB drug-resistant regimen, rendering it effective across treatment regimens, and also showed promising results in CD4+ knockout mice, perhaps due to enhanced Rel-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Notably, our novel fusion vaccine was also immunogenic in nonhuman primates, the gold standard animal model for TB vaccine studies, eliciting antigen-specific T-cell responses in blood and BAL fluid analogous to those observed in protected mice. Our findings have critical implications for therapeutic TB vaccine clinical development in immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations and may serve as a model for defining immunological correlates of therapeutic vaccine-induced protection.

Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

        <tr id="Background IκBζ, a rather unknown co-regulator of NF-κB, is mostly inducibly expressed and can either activate or repress a specific subset of NF-κB target genes. While its role as a transcriptional regulator of various cytokines and chemokines in immune cells has been revealed, IκBζ’s function in solid cancer remains unclear. Methods We investigated IκBζ expression in melanoma, and assessed its impact on target gene expression, tumor growth, and response to immunotherapy in melanoma cell lines, mouse models, and patient samples. Results Unlike in other cell types, IκBζ protein was found to be constitutively expressed in a subfraction of melanoma cell lines, and around 35% of melanoma cases. This atypical expression pattern of IκBζ did not correlate with its mRNA levels or known driver mutations, but instead seemed to result from changes in its post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation. Deleting constitutively expressed IκBζ abrogated the activity and chromatin association of STAT3 and p65, leading to reduced expression of the pro-proliferative cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 in melanoma cells. Consequently, loss of tumor-derived IκBζ suppressed self-sustained melanoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, constitutive IκBζ expression suppressed the induction of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5, which impaired the recruitment of NK and CD8+ T-cells to the tumor, causing resistance to α-PD-1 immunotherapy in mice. Furthermore, the expression of tumor-derived IκBζ also correlated with the absence of CD8+ T-cells in human melanoma samples and progressive disease during immunotherapy. Conclusion We propose that tumor-derived IκBζ could serve as a new therapeutic target and prognostic marker that characterizes melanoma with high tumor cell proliferation, cytotoxic T- and NK-cell exclusion, and unfavorable immunotherapy responses. Targeting IκBζ expression might open up a new therapy option to re-establish the recruitment of cytotoxic cells, thereby resensitizing for immunotherapy. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the leading cause of mortality due to a single infectious organism. While generally curable, TB requires a lengthy and complex antibiotic regimen, due in large part to bacteria that can shift to a persistent state in the presence of antibiotic pressure. RelMtb is the primary enzyme regulating the stringent response, which contributes to the metabolic shift of Mtb to a persistent state. Targeting RelMtb with a vaccine to eliminate persistent bacteria through the induction of RelMtb-specific T-cell immunity in combination with antibiotics to kill dividing bacteria has shown promise in model systems. In a mouse model of Mtb infection, a vaccine created by genetically fusing relMtb to the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 3α (MIP3α), a ligand for the CC chemokine receptor type 6 (CCR6) present on immature dendritic cells, has been shown to enhance T-cell responses and accelerate eradication of infection in mouse models compared to a vaccine lacking the chemokine component. In this study, immunogenicity studies in the mouse and rhesus macaque models provide evidence that intranasal administrations of the DNA form of the MipRel vaccine led to enhanced lung infiltration of T cells after a series of immunizations. Furthermore, despite similar T-cell immunity seen in PBMCs between MipRel and Rel vaccinations, lung and bronchoalveolar lavage cell samples are more enriched for cytokine-secreting T cells in MipRel groups compared to Rel groups. We conclude that intranasal immunization with a MIP-3α fusion vaccine represents a novel strategy for use of a simple DNA vaccine formulation to elicit T-cell immune responses within the respiratory tract. That this formulation is immunogenic in a non-human primate model historically viewed as poorly responsive to DNA vaccines indicates the potential for clinical application in the treatment of Mtb infection, with possible application to other respiratory pathogens. Future studies will further characterize the protective effect of this vaccination platform.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, iron toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) are widely held to drive tissue damage, yet the specific roles of central nervous system (CNS)- resident versus CNS-invading MPs remain unclear. Here, by combining single-cell profiling with conditional gene targeting, we systematically dissected and interfered with ROS production across CNS MPs in a preclinical model for neuroinflammation. We show that CNS-invading monocyte derived cells (MdCs) exhibit a higher oxidative stress gene signature and produce more ROS compared to CNS-resident microglia. While NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a phagocytic source of ROS, proved redundant, our findings underscore the critical role of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in driving oxidative tissue damage. Quenching mtROS through mitocatalase overexpression in MdCs, but not microglia, significantly alleviated neuroinflammation in mice. Thus, our study resolves a longstanding controversy, identifying MdCs as the primary driver of ROS-mediated neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy leads to cancer eradication despite the tumor’s immunosuppressive environment. Here, we used extended long-term in-vivo imaging and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of endogenous melanoma in zebrafish, and multiplex imaging of human melanoma, to identify domains that facilitate immune response during immunotherapy. We identified crater-shaped pockets at the margins of zebrafish and human melanoma, rich with beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and antigen recognition molecules. The craters harbor the highest density of CD8+ T cells in the tumor. In zebrafish, CD8+ T cells formed prolonged interactions with melanoma cells within craters, characteristic of antigen recognition. Following immunostimulatory treatment, the craters enlarged and became the major site of activated CD8+ T cell accumulation and tumor killing that was B2M dependent. In humans, craters predicted immune response to ICB therapy, showing response better than high T cell infiltration. This marks craters as potential new diagnostic tool for immunotherapy success and targets to enhance ICB response.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

        <tr id="
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive, poorly immunogenic cancer and non-responsive to all currently available treatments, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. As survival rates remain low (13%), there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options. A hallmark of PDAC is the limited infiltration of anti-tumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data of PDAC tumors from treatment naïve patients reveals high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. PSGL-1 is an intrinsic negative regulator of CD8+ T cells that promotes the development of functional exhaustion. We therefore hypothesized that PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression is a critical barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity in PDAC. To test this, we used preclinical models of orthotopic injection PDAC tumor cells into pancreata, recapitulating patient responses to PDAC with limited T cell infiltrates and uncontrolled tumor growth in C57BL/6 (wildtype) control mice and compared anti-tumor immune responses in PSGL-1KO (C57BL/6 background) mice. At 28 days post-injection of KPC.4662 PDAC tumor cells, tumor burden in PSGL-1KO mice was reduced by >50% compared to controls, with 45% of PSGL-1KO animals exhibiting >70% reduction. Total immune infiltration (CD45+) was 2-fold greater in tumors from PSGL-1KO mice, with significant increases in infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Detailed analyses revealed that infiltrating CD8+ T cells from PSGL-1KO mice were less terminally differentiated towards exhaustion. PSGL-1KO PD-1+ CD8+ T cells expressed less TOX expression and fewer cells co-expressed CD38 and CD101 while more expressed CX3CR1 compared to controls. Intratumoral PSGL-1KO CD8+ T cells also retained greater functionality as well as indicated by inflammatory cytokine production (IFNg, TNFa) and Granzyme B expression. Moreover, PSGL-1KO mice showed protection against metastatic disease to the lungs. We find that protection by PSGL-1KO mice is T cell dependent as transient depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prior to tumor cell implantation results in the loss of PDAC tumor growth inhibition by PSGL-1KO mice. Less-differentiated, proliferation-competent precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) are essential to PD-1 ICB responsiveness in patients and preclinical models. Given that PSGL-1-deficiency limits terminal differentiation of CD8+ T cells in PDAC, we hypothesized that PSGL-1-deficiency would promote responsiveness to PD-1 ICB, which is ineffective as a monotherapy in PDAC patients and mouse models. While therapeutic treatment with anti-PD-1 had no effect on the tumor growth in the control animals, PD-1 ICB resulted in tumor ablation in 85% of PSGL-1KO animals, demonstrating a profound synergistic effect of PD-1 inhibition in the absence of PSGL-1. From these studies, we conclude that PSGL- 1 is a critical inhibitor anti-tumor T cell immunity in PDAC and represents a novel ICB target with high translational potential for promoting immune responses to PDAC tumors.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT In the face of the ever-present burden of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, there is a growing need to comprehensively assess individual- and population-level immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Many of these efforts, however, focus exclusively on antibody-mediated immunity, ignoring the role of T cells. Aimed at clinicians, public health practioners, and others who play central roles in human vaccine research but do not have formal training in immunology, we review how vaccines against infectious diseases elicit T cell responses, what types of vaccines elicit T cell responses, and how T cell responses are measured. We then use examples to demonstrate six ways that T cells contribute to protection from VPD, including directly mediating protection, enabling antibody responses, reducing disease severity, increasing cross-reactivity, improving durability, and protecting special populations. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and solutions to more widespread consideration of T cell responses in clinical vaccinology.">

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) triggers an immune response that contributes to anti-tumor effects. Induction of interferon beta (IFN-β) is a key event in this immunogenicity of RT. We have previously shown that TRIM33, a chromatin reader, restrains IFN-β expression in Toll-like receptor-activated myeloid cells. Here, we explored whether deleting Trim33 in myeloid cells might improve the radio-induced immune response, and subsequent efficiency of RT. We first established that Trim33-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages showed increased expression of IFN-β in response to direct irradiation, or to treatment with irradiated cancer cells, further supporting our hypothesis. We then tested the efficiency of a single dose RT in three subcutaneous and one orthotopic tumor models. In all situations, myeloid deletion of Trim33 led to a significantly improved response after RT, leading to a complete and durable response in most of the treated mice bearing orthotopic oral tumors. This effect required the IFN-I pathway, and the presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes, but not NK cells. In addition, cured mice were capable of rejecting a secondary tumor challenge, demonstrating an in situ vaccination effect. We conclude that deleting Trim33 in myeloid cells improves RT efficiency, through a mechanism involving the IFN-I pathway and the immune response. Our work suggests that myeloid Trim33 is a host factor affecting the tumor response to RT, thus representing a new potential therapeutic target for modifying RT responses.">

These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell-mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant and influential elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME), giving support to tumor development in multiple ways. Among other mechanisms, CAFs are important regulators of immunological processes occurring in tumors. However, CAF-mediated tumor immunomodulation in the context of radiotherapy remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore effects of radiation on CAF-derived immunoregulatory signals to the TME. Methods Primary CAF cultures were established from freshly collected human NSCLC lung tumors. CAFs were exposed to single-high or fractionated radiation regimens (1x18Gy or 3x6Gy), and the expression of different immunoregulatory cell-associated and secreted signaling molecules was analyzed 48h and 6 days after initiation of treatment. Analyses included quantitative measurements of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), interferon (IFN) type I responses, expression of immune regulatory receptors, and secretion of soluble cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. CAFs are able to survive ablative radiation regimens, however they enter into a stage of premature cell senescence. Results Our data show that CAFs avoid apoptosis and do not contribute by release of DAMPs or IFN-I secretion to radiation-mediated tumor immunoregulation. Furthermore, the secretion of relevant immunoregulatory cytokines and growth factors including TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IL-1β, VEGF, CXCL12, and CXCL10 remain comparable between non-irradiated and radiation-induced senescent CAFs. Importantly, radiation exposure modifies the cell surface expression of some key immunoregulatory receptors, including upregulation of CD73 and CD276. Discussion Our data suggest that CAFs do not participate in the release of danger signals or IFN-I secretion following radiotherapy. The immune phenotype of CAFs and radiation-induced senescent CAFs is similar, however, the observed elevation of some cell surface immunological receptors on irradiated CAFs could contribute to the establishment of an enhanced immunosuppressive TME after radiotherapy.">

These cells encompass heterogeneous subsets like cDC1s, cDC2s, and pDCs, capable of shaping antigen presentation and influencing T cell activation through the balance between the Th1, Th2, and Th17 profiles and the activation of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). The intricate interaction between DC subsets and the high density of intratumoral mature DCs shapes tumor-specific immune responses and impacts therapeutic outcomes.

        <tr id="Combination therapy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but many patients still have unsatisfactory outcomes. CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy. Our research revealed one mechanism by which hepatoma cells can survive the combination therapy, providing a theoretical basis for the refined treatment of HCC.">

Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.">

        <tr id="Hypoxia occurs in settings where stringent control of inflammation is mandatory to avoid tissue damage. Here, we analyzed how hypoxia-induced mediators alter recognition of pathogen-derived molecular patterns (PAMPs). The most relevant finding was that hypoxia selectively targets IFN-α induced upon stimulation with nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLR7/8 and -9) in PBMC. Notably, IFN-α secretion was reduced, but IFN-α producing capacity preserved. Corroborating these findings IFN-dependent cytokines IP-10 and IL-12 p70 were reduced under hypoxia, while other cytokines such as TNF remained unaffected. A role for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) was confirmed with prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors CoCl2 and DMOG. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) were identified as the major source of IFN-α and experiments in B cell/PDC and monocyte/PDC cocultures indicated that T cells are not required and both lymphoid and myeloid cells equally support inhibition of IFN-α. Moreover, supernatants from unstimulated PBMC generated under hypoxic conditions were not suppressive but further experiments indicated that hypoxia-specific release of IFN-α regulators lactate and TGF-β can contribute to the IFN-α blockage and might synergize with PGE2. However, each one of these factors alone is insufficient to block IFN-α secretion. These findings suggest that control of the PDC response occurs via combined soluble factors and cell contact-dependent mechanisms, thereby enabling a fine-tuning of the anti-microbial immune response in hypoxia.">

Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) therapy is designed to regulate an excessive inflammatory response and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We aimed to investigate a targeted subset of granulocytes and monocytes to be removed after GMA therapy in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection. Methods We established an ex vivo experimental system to study the effects of GMA. Blood samples were collected into EDTA‐treated tubes and a mixture of blood samples and cellulose acetate beads was used in GMA. After GMA, blood samples were removed, and the granulocyte and monocyte subtypes before and after GMA were determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. To analyze mass cytometry data with a self‐organizing map, hierarchical clustering was used to determine the appropriate number of metaclusters from t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results We included seven patients with severe COVID‐19 and four age‐ and sex‐matched volunteers. Granulocyte subsets removed by GMA strongly expressed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b, and weakly expressed CD11c, consistent with mature and activated neutrophils. Monocyte subsets strongly expressed CD14, weakly expressed CD33 and CD45RO, and did not express CD16. These subsets were indicated to promote the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate T cells. Conclusions The identification of the granulocyte and monocyte subsets removed after GMA in patients with severe COVID‐19 may help explain the potential mechanism underlying the effectiveness of GMA in COVID‐19 and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The control of bacterial growth is key to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Granulomas represent independent foci of the host immune response that present heterogeneous capacity for control of bacterial growth. At the whole tissue level, B cells and CD4 or CD8 T cells have an established role in immune protection against TB. Immune cells interact within each granuloma response, but the impact of granuloma immune composition on bacterial replication remains unknown. Here we investigate the associations between immune cell composition, including B cell, CD4, and CD8 T cells, and the state of replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) within the granuloma. A measure of ribosomal RNA synthesis, the RS ratio®, represents a proxy measure of Mtb replication at the whole tissue level. We adapted the RS ratio through use of in situ hybridization, to identify replicating and non-replicating Mtb within each designated granuloma. We applied a regression model to characterize the associations between immune cell populations and the state of Mtb replication within each respective granuloma. In the evaluation of nearly 200 granulomas, we identified heterogeneity in both immune cell composition and proportion of replicating bacteria. We found clear evidence of directional associations between immune cell composition and replicating Mtb. Controlling for vaccination status and endpoint post-infection, granulomas with lower CD4 or higher CD8 cell counts are associated with a higher percent of replicating Mtb. Conversely, changes in B cell proportions were associated with little change in Mtb replication. This study establishes heterogeneity across granulomas, demonstrating that certain immune cell types are differentially associated with control of Mtb replication. These data suggest that evaluation at the granuloma level may be imperative to identifying correlates of immune protection.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with a strong chronic inflammatory component. One possible strategy for the treatment of T1D is to stimulate the regulatory arm of the immune response, i.e. to promote the function of tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC) and regulatory T cells (Treg). Since both cell types have been shown to be responsive to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation, we used a recently characterized member of a new class of fluorescent AHR ligands, AGT-5, to modulate streptozotocin-induced T1D in C57BL/6 mice. Prophylactic oral administration of AGT-5 reduced hyperglycemia and insulitis in these mice. Phenotypic and functional analysis of cells in the pancreatic infiltrates of AGT-5-treated mice (at the early phase of T1D) revealed a predominantly anti-inflammatory environment, as evidenced by the upregulation of tolDC and Treg frequency, while CD8+ cell, Th1 and Th17 cells were significantly reduced. Similarly, AGT-5 enhanced the proportion of Treg and tolDC in small intestine lamina propria and suppressed the activation status of antigen-presenting cells through down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. The expression levels of Cyp1a1, controlled by the AHR, were increased in CD4+, CD8+ and Treg, confirming the AHR-mediated effect of AGT-5 in these cells. Finally, AGT-5 stimulated the function of regulatory cells in the pancreatic islets and lamina propria by upregulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase 1 (IDO1) in tolDC. These findings were supported by the abrogation of AGT-5-mediated in vitro effects on DC in the presence of IDO1 inhibitor. AGT-5 also increased the expression of CD39 or CD73 ATP-degrading ectoenzymes by Treg. The increase in Treg is further supported by the upregulated frequency of IL-2-producing type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the lamina propria. Anti-inflammatory effects of AGT-5 were also validated on human tonsil cells, where in vitro exposure to AGT-5 increased the proportion of immunosuppressive dendritic cells and ILC3. These results suggest that AGT-5, by stimulating AHR, may promote a general immunosuppressive environment in the pancreas and small intestine lamina propria at the early phase of disease, and thereby inhibit the severity of T1D in mice.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular events seem to occur more frequently after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests a possible role of immune checkpoints in accelerating atherosclerosis formation. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of soluble and membrane-bound immune checkpoints in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We assessed the levels of 14 soluble immune checkpoints in fasting blood plasma of PAD patients (intermittent claudication, n= 37) and healthy controls (HCs, n=39) by Multiplex protein assay. We measured the levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1/2), B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), glucocorticoid-induced TNRF-related protein (GITR), herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), CD28, CD27, CD80, CD137 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). The surface expression of CD28, PD-L2, PD-1, GITR, LAG-3, TIM-3 and BTLA on peripheral blood immune cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine production capacity was measured by flow cytometry in TIM-3+ T cells to determine immune exhaustion. Soluble levels of PD-L2 were decreased in PAD patients, but only in females, whereas soluble levels of TIM-3 showed a trend towards increased concentration in female PAD patients. All monocyte subsets had increased frequencies of PD-L2+ cells in PAD patients. CD4+ T cells had increased frequencies of TIM-3+ cells, which showed little overlap with other immune exhaustion markers. TIM-3+ CD4+ T cells appeared to have a low capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, but a higher capacity to produce IL-10 compared to TIM-3-CD4+ T cells. We found that PAD patients show differences in expression of both membrane-bound and soluble immune checkpoints. Some of these differences might be caused by prolonged immune activation, although immune exhaustion markers did not always overlap.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could "reprogram" intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore T-cell responses.


METHODS
Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.


RESULTS
Intratumoral injection of RRV-IRF8 in mice bearing intracerebral SB28 glioma significantly suppressed the tumor growth and prolonged survival. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Furthermore, DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. In vivo treatment with azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor, showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation, achieving improved tumor control.">

        <tr id="With the introduction of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell (CAR T) therapies, bispecific CD3/CD20 antibodies and anti-CD19 antibodies, immunotherapy continues to transform the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A number of novel immunotherapeutic strategies are under investigation to build upon current clinical benefit and offer further options to those patients who cannot tolerate conventional intensive therapies due to their age and/or state of health. Alongside immunotherapies that leverage the adaptive immune response, natural killer (NK) cell and myeloid cell-engaging therapies can utilize the innate immune system. Monoclonal antibodies engineered for greater recognition by the patient's immune system can enhance antitumor cytotoxic mechanisms mediated by NK cells and macrophages. In addition, CAR technology is extending into NK cells and macrophages and investigational immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting macrophage/myeloid cell checkpoints via the CD47/SIRPα axis are in development. Regimens that engage both innate and adaptive immune responses may help to overcome resistance to current immunotherapies. Furthermore, combinations of immunotherapy and oncogenic pathway inhibitors to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of DLBCL may also potentiate antitumor responses. As immunotherapy treatment options continue to expand, both in the first-line setting and further lines of therapy, understanding how to harness these immunotherapies and the potential for combination approaches will be important for the development of future DLBCL treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Alemtuzumab induction with belatacept/rapamycin-based maintenance immunotherapy (ABR) prevents kidney allograft rejection and specifically limits early costimulation blockade-resistant rejection (CoBRR). To evaluate the mechanisms by which this regimen alters CoBRR, we characterized the phenotype and functional response of preexisting memory cells to allogeneic endothelial cells using intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. IL-7-induced lymphocyte proliferation in the presence or absence of rapamycin was assessed to characterize the phenotype of proliferating cells. Lymphocytes from 40 recipients who underwent transplant using the ABR regimen were studied longitudinally. The rapid immunoresponses of preexisting alloreactive cells to allogeneic endothelial cells were predominantly CD8+TNF-α+/IFN-γ+ cells. These cells were effector memory (TEM) and terminally differentiated effector memory cells lacking CD28 expression, and most were CD57+PD1-. Neither rapamycin nor belatacept directly inhibited these cells. IL-7, a cytokine induced during lymphopenia postdepletion, provoked dramatic CD8+ TEM cell proliferation and a low level of CD8+CD57+PD1- cell expansion in vitro. The IL-7 stimulation induced CD8+ cell mTOR phosphorylation, and rapamycin treatment markedly inhibited IL-7-induced TEM and CD57+PD1- cell expansion. This effect was evident in patients receiving the ABR in that the repopulation of CD8+CD57+PD1- TEM cells was substantially suppressed for at least 36 mo after transplant. These findings help define one mechanism by which a costimulation blockade/rapamycin-based therapy following alemtuzumab induction minimizes CoBRR, namely that in the presence of rapamycin, costimulation-resistant alloreactive cells are disproportionately ineffective at repopulating following post-transplant T cell depletion.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints (ICPs), such as programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1), is used as a treatment option for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, overall response rate to anti-PD-L1 treatment is limited due to antigen heterogeneity and the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), an ICP as well as a neoexpressed tumor-associated antigen, is previously demonstrated to be a beneficial target in combination with anti-PD-L1. In this study, a nanobody-based trispecific T cell engager (Nb-TriTE) is developed, capable of simultaneously binding to T cells, macrophages, and cancer cells while redirecting T cells toward tumor cells expressing PD-L1- and/or HLA-G. Nb-TriTE shows broad spectrum anti-tumor effects in vitro by augmenting cytotoxicity mediated by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In a humanized immunodeficient murine NSCLC model, Nb-TriTE exhibits superior anti-cancer potency compared to monoclonal antibodies and bispecific T cell engagers. Nb-TriTE, at the dose with pharmacoactivity, does not induce additional enhancement of circulating cytokines secretion from PMBCs. Nb-TriTE effectively prolongs the survival of mice without obvious adverse events. In conclusion, this study introduces an innovative therapeutic approach to address the challenges of immunotherapy and the tumor microenvironment in NSCLC through utilizing the dual ICP-targeting Nb-TriTE.">

        <tr id="Efficient efferocytosis is essential for maintaining homeostasis. Excessive apoptotic cell (AC) death and impaired macrophage efferocytosis lead to autoantigen release and autoantibody production, immune activation, and organ damage. It remains unclear whether these immunogenic autoantigens are the sole cause of increased autoimmunity or if efferocytosis of ACs directly influences macrophage function, impacting their ability to activate T cells and potentially amplifying autoimmune responses. Additionally, it has not been established if enhancing macrophage efferocytosis or modulating macrophage responses to AC engulfment can be protective in autoimmune-like disorders. Our previous work showed WDFY3 is crucial for efficient macrophage efferocytosis. This study reveals that myeloid knockout of Wdfy3 exacerbates autoimmunity in young mice with increased AC burden by systemic injections of ACs and in middle-aged mice developing spontaneous autoimmunity, whereas ectopic overexpression of WDFY3 suppresses autoimmunity in these models. Macrophages, as efferocytes, can activate T cells and the inflammasome upon engulfing ACs, which are suppressed by overexpressing WDFY3. This work uncovered the role of WDFY3 as a protector against autoimmunity by promoting macrophage efferocytosis thus limiting autoantigen production, as well as mitigating T cell activation and inflammasome activation.">

Engagement of PD-L1 with PD-1 expressed on CD8+ T cells activates downstream signaling pathways that culminate in T cell exhaustion and/or apoptosis. Physiologically, these immunosuppressive effects exist to prevent autoimmunity, but cancer cells exploit this pathway by overexpressing PD-L1 to facilitate immune escape. Intravenously (IV) administered immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that block the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 have achieved great success in reversing T cell exhaustion and promoting tumor regression in various malignancies. However, these ICIs can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to off-tumor toxicities which limits their therapeutic potential. Therefore, considerable effort has been channeled into exploring alternative delivery strategies that enhance tumor-directed delivery of PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs and reduce irAEs. Here, we briefly describe PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy and associated irAEs. We then provide a detailed review of alternative delivery approaches, including locoregional (LDD)-, oncolytic virus (OV)-, nanoparticle (NP)-, and ultrasound and microbubble (USMB)-mediated delivery that are currently under investigation for enhancing tumor-specific delivery to minimize toxic off-tumor effects.

        <tr id="HIV-induced persistent immune activation is a key mediator of inflammatory comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurocognitive disorders. While a preponderance of data indicate that gut barrier disruption and microbial translocation are drivers of chronic immune activation, the molecular mechanisms of this persistent inflammatory state remain poorly understood. Here, utilizing the nonhuman primate model of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection with suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), we investigated activation of inflammasome pathways and their association with intestinal epithelial barrier disruption (IEBD). Longitudinal blood samples obtained from rhesus macaques with chronic SIV infection and long-term suppressive ART were evaluated for IEBD biomarkers, inflammasome activation (IL-1β and IL-18), inflammatory cytokines, and triglyceride (TG) levels. Activated monocyte subpopulations and glycolytic potential were investigated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). During the chronic phase of treated SIV infection, elevated levels of plasma IL-1β and IL-18 were observed following the hallmark increase in IEBD biomarkers, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and LPS-binding protein (LBP). Further, significant correlations of plasma IFABP levels with IL-1β and IL-18 were observed between 10 and 12 months of ART. Higher levels of sCD14, IL-6, and GM-CSF, among other inflammatory mediators, were also observed only during the long-term SIV + ART phase along with a trend of increase in the frequencies of activated CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocyte subpopulations. Lastly, we found elevated levels of blood TG and higher glycolytic capacity in PBMCs of chronic SIV-infected macaques with long-term ART. The increase in circulating IL-18 and IL-1β following IEBD and their significant positive correlation with IFABP suggest a connection between gut barrier disruption and inflammasome activation during chronic SIV infection, despite viral suppression with ART. Additionally, the increase in markers of monocyte activation, along with elevated TG and enhanced glycolytic pathway activity, indicates metabolic remodeling that could fuel metabolic syndrome. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which gut dysfunction and inflammasome activation contribute to HIV-associated metabolic complications, enabling targeted interventions in people with HIV.">

Current CXCR4 inhibitors mobilize AML cells into the bloodstream where they become more chemosensitive have failed to improve patient survival, likely reflecting persistent receptor localization on target cells. Here we characterize the signaling properties of CXCL12-locked dimer (CXCL12-LD), a bioengineered variant of the dimeric CXCL12 structure. CXCL12-LD binding resulted in lower levels of G protein, β-arrestin, and intracellular calcium mobilization, consistent with the locked dimer being a partial agonist of CXCR4. Further, CXCL12-LD failed to induce chemotaxis in AML cells. Despite these partial agonist properties, CXCL12-LD increased CXCR4 internalization compared to wildtype and locked-monomer forms of CXCL12. Analysis of a previously published AML transcriptomic data showed CXCR4 positive AML cells co-express genes involved in chemoresistance and maintenance of a blast-like state. The CXCL12-LD partial agonist effectively mobilized stem cells into the bloodstream in mice suggesting a potential role for their use in targeting CXCR4. Together, our results suggest that enhanced internalization by CXCL12-LD partial agonist signaling can avoid pharmacodynamic tolerance and may identify new avenues to better target GPCRs.">

        <tr id="Currently, only 20-40% of cancer patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and characterizing dynamic changes in the immunological landscape during treatment are critical for improving responsiveness to immunotherapy. Here, we identified JNK signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a regulator of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bladder cancer treated with a JNK inhibitor revealed enhanced cytotoxicity and effector functions of CD8+ T cells. In untreated tumors, CAFs interacted frequently with CD8+ T cells and mediated their exhaustion. JNK inhibition abrogated the immunosuppression function of CAFs by downregulating the expression of TSLP, thereby restoring CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In addition, blockade of CAF-derived TSLP in combination with anti-PD1 treatment promoted tumor elimination by CD8+ T cells in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that JNK signaling plays an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment by promoting expression of TSLP in CAFs and suggest that inhibiting JNK signaling could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prototypical autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to CD4+ T cells, memory B cells are now recognized as a critical cell type in the disease. This is underlined by the fact that the best-characterized environmental risk factor for MS is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can infect and persist in memory B cells throughout life. Several studies have identified changes in anti-EBV immunity in patients with MS. Examples include elevated titers of anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibodies, interactions of these with the MS-associated HLA-DR15 haplotype, and molecular mimicry with MS autoantigens like myelin basic protein (MBP), anoctamin-2 (ANO2), glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM), and alpha-crystallin B (CRYAB). In this study, we employ a simple in vitro assay to examine the memory B cell antibody repertoire in MS patients and healthy controls. We replicate previous serological data from MS patients demonstrating an increased secretion of anti-EBNA1380-641 IgG in cell culture supernatants, as well as a positive correlation of these levels with autoantibodies against GlialCAM262-416 and ANO21-275. For EBNA1380-641 and ANO21-275, we provide additional evidence suggesting antibody cross-reactivity between the two targets. Further, we show that two efficacious MS treatments – natalizumab (NAT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) – are associated with distinct changes in the EBNA1-directed B cell response and that these alterations can be attributed to the unique mechanisms of action of these therapies. Using an in vitro system, our study confirms MS-associated changes in the anti-EBNA1 memory B cell response, EBNA1380-641 antibody cross-reactivity with ANO21-275, and reveals treatment-associated changes in the immunoglobulin repertoire in MS.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with unclear pathogenesis and no effective treatments. We aimed to investigate a novel mechanistic theory and treat HAM patients with rituximab, which can deplete CD20+ B lymphocytes in circulation.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was analyzed to identify HTLV-1-associated B cells and their effect on T cells. An observational analysis of our HAM cohort was conducted to elucidate changes in the immunological microenvironment of these patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HAM patients were isolated to explore the efficacy of B cell depletion in vitro. To assess the effect of B-cell depletion on HAM patients, eligible participants in our cohort received rituximab therapy (NCT04004819).


RESULTS
ScRNA-seq results suggest a significant effect of HTLV-1-associated B cells on T cells. Additionally, HTLV-1 was found to infect B cells and depletion of B cells inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Number of B cells in HAM patients had positive correlation with the proviral load and infected cell counts. Depletion of B cells led to a reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load in vitro. Furthermore, in clinical trial, 14 HAM patients were enrolled. Three patients (21.4%) who received rituximab failed to achieve remission, compared to 24 (85.7%) patients received any other therapy that failed to achieve remission. With a low level of circulating B cells, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in CD4+ T cells fell.


INTERPRETATION
This study provided evidence that depleting B-lymphocytes is an innovative strategy for treating patients with HAM and broadens the understanding of the role of B cells in infectious immunity.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Alloreactive memory T cells have been implicated as central drivers of transplant rejection. Perplexingly, innate cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12, are also associated with rejection of organ transplants. However, the pathways of innate immune activation in allogeneic transplantation are unclear. While the role of microbial and cell death products has been previously described, we identified alloreactive memory CD4 T cells as the primary triggers of innate inflammation. Memory CD4 T cells engaged MHC II-mismatched dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the production of innate inflammatory cytokines. This innate inflammation was independent of several pattern recognition receptors and was primarily driven by TNF superfamily ligands expressed by alloreactive memory CD4 T cells. Blocking of CD40L and TNFα resulted in dampened inflammation, and mice genetically deficient in these molecules exhibited prolonged survival of cardiac allografts. Furthermore, myeloid cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac transplants was compromised in both CD40L- and TNFα-deficient recipients. Strikingly, we found that priming of naive alloreactive CD8 T cells was dependent on licensing of DCs by memory CD4 T cells. This study unravels the key mechanisms by which alloreactive memory CD4 T cells contribute to destructive pathology and transplant rejection.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in resistance to immunotherapy. In this study, we identified epidermal growth factor-like 6 (Egfl6) as a new regulator of myeloid cell functions. Our analyses indicated that Egfl6, via binding with β3 integrins and activation of p38 and SYK signaling, acts as a chemotactic factor for myeloid cells migration and promotes their differentiation towards an immunosuppressive state. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer (OvCa), tumor expression of Egfl6 increased the intra-tumoral accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSCs and TAMs and their expression of immunosuppressive factors, including CXCL2, IL-10 and PD-L1. Consistent with this, in an immune 'hot' tumor model, Egfl6 expression eliminated response to a-PD-L1 therapy, while Egfl6 neutralizing antibody decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and PMN-MDSCs and restored the efficacy of a-PD-L1 therapy. Supporting a role in human tumors, in human OvCa tissue samples, areas of high EGFL6 expression co-localized with myeloid cell infiltration. scRNAseq analyses revealed a correlation between EGFL6 and immune cell expression of immunosuppressive factors. Our data provide mechanistic insights into the onco-immunologic functions of EGFL6 in mediating tumor immune suppression and identified EGFL6 as a potential novel therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy in OvCa patients.">

        <tr id="The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in modulating the proliferation, activation, and normal functioning of immune cells through the regulation of protein degradation and function. By influencing the expression of immune checkpoint-associated proteins, the UPS modulates T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and can potentially facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. Additionally, the UPS contributes to the remodeling of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) by regulating B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and Treg cells. Targeting the UPS in conjunction with immune checkpoint-associated proteins, and combining these with other therapeutic approaches, may significantly enhance the efficacy of combination therapies and pave the way for novel cancer treatment strategies. In this review, we first summarize the composition and alterations of the TIME, with a particular emphasis on the role of the UPS in TIME and its interactions with various immune cell types. Finally, we explore the potential of combining UPS-targeted therapies with immunotherapy to substantially improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy and enhance patient survival outcomes.">

Here, we used TIGIT knockout (KO) mice to demonstrate that mouse TIGIT directly interacts with Candida albicans. Reduced fungal growth and colonization were observed when TIGIT-KO splenocytes were co-cultured with C. albicans compared to the wild type (WT). In a systemic candidiasis model, TIGIT-KO mice exhibited improved survival and reduced body weight loss compared to WT mice. Organ-specific fungal burden assessment revealed significantly lower fungal loads in the kidneys, spleen, and lungs of TIGIT-KO mice. Finally, we show that the agglutinin-like sequence proteins ALS6, ALS7, and ALS9 of C. albicans are ligands for TIGIT and that the absence of these proteins abolishes the TIGIT effect in vivo. Our results identify the significance of TIGIT in modulating host defense against C. albicans and highlight the potential therapeutic implications for C. albicans infections.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly lethal and resistant to immunotherapy. Although immune recognition can be enhanced with immunomodulatory agents including checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines, few patients experience clinical efficacy because the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) is dominated by immunosuppressive myeloid cells that impose T cell inhibition. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) was reported to downregulate metabolic regulators arginase and iNOS in immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhance immunity against immune-sensitive tumors including head and neck cancers. We show for the first time that combining a PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil, with a mesothelin-specific vaccine, anti-PD1, and anti-CTLA4 yields antitumor efficacy even against immune-resistant PDAC. To determine immunologic advantages conferred by tadalafil, we profiled the TiME using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA analysis with Domino to infer intercellular signaling. Our analyses demonstrated that tadalafil reprograms myeloid cells to be less immunosuppressive. Moreover, tadalafil synergized with the vaccine, enhancing T cell activation including mesothelin-specific T cells. Tadalafil treatment was also associated with myeloid-T cell signaling axes important for antitumor responses (e.g., Cxcr3, Il12). Our study shows that PDE5 inhibition combined with vaccine-based immunotherapy promotes pro-inflammatory states of myeloid cells, activation of T cells, and enhanced myeloid-T cell crosstalk to yield antitumor efficacy against immune-resistant PDAC.">

        <tr id="Our understanding of T-cell-dependent humoral responses has been largely shaped by studies involving model antigens such as recombinant proteins and viruses 1,2. In these contexts, B cells internalize the entire antigen or pathogen, and present a range of antigens to helper CD4+ T cells to initiate the humoral response. However, this model does not account for large pathogens (such as parasites) that are too large to be taken up by individual B cells, and the mechanisms by which B cells acquire and present antigens from large complex pathogens to T cells remain poorly understood. Here we used Plasmodium, the causative parasite of malaria, as a model to investigate the requirements for T cell help for B cells targeting the Plasmodium surface circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Upon Plasmodium sporozoite (SPZ) immunization, CSP-specific B cells can form a synapse-like structure with SPZs and take up CSP and non-CSP surface antigens. As a result, CSP-specific B cells can receive help from CD4+ T cells specific to antigens that are located on the surface but not cytosol of the Plasmodium SPZ. Therefore, B cells can obtain help, not only from T cells with the same protein specificity, but also from T cells specific for spatially linked antigens. This flexibility in T cell help may enhance the initiation and maintenance of humoral immune responses to complex pathogens.">

Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

        <tr id="STAT3 is required for Th17-cell differentiation, and dominant-negative STAT3 mutations cause Autosomal Dominant-Hyper-IgE Syndrome (AD-HIES), which is characterized by a lack of Th17-cells and recurrent infections with opportunistic extracellular pathogens. T-cell responses to opportunistic pathogens in AD-HIES patients have however not been characterized. We previously identified an enigmatic population of IL-10 producing CCR6+Th-cells that were largely non-polarised and lacked other subset-defining differentiation markers (“CCR6single-positive(SP)”). Here we report that CCR6SPT-cells are central memory T-cells (TCM) that expressed the stemness-associated transcription factors LEF1 and TCF7, but also RORγt, the lineage-defining transcription factor of Th17-cells. Non-polarized CCR6SPT-cells differentiated spontaneously to Th17-cells upon TCR stimulation, indicating that they were pre-committed to a Th17 fate. Spontaneous Th17 differentiation was promoted by an autocrine loop of STAT3-activating cytokines and inhibited by IL-4. IL-12 induced in addition IFN-γ, and consequently differentiation to Th1/17-cells. CCR6+T-cells were strongly reduced in AD-HIES and Th17- and Tfh17-cells were hardly detectable. However, the residual CCR6+T-cells contained Th1/17- and CCR6SPT-cells that proliferated in vivo. They produced high amounts of IL-10, indicating that, unexpectedly, IL-10 production by human T-cells is STAT3-independent in vivo. Intriguingly, opportunistic pathogens selectively activated CCR6+T-cells in AD-HIES patients to produce IL-10. Opportunistic bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis induced in addition IL-2 and IFN-γ. We conclude that Th17 differentiation is not completely impaired in the absence of STAT3 signalling but arrested at an early stage of CCR6+TCM. These pre-Th17-cells produce IL-10 and require STAT3 to differentiate to Th17-cells and to fight extracellular pathogens but could directly generate Th1/17-cells to contain intracellular bacteria. Significance AD-HIES patients have impaired STAT3 signalling, lack consequently Th17-cells and experience recurrent infections with opportunistic extracellular pathogens. These patients were key to the dogma that Th17-cells control extracellular pathogens, but T-cell responses to these pathogens have surprisingly never been analyzed. Here, we report that Th17 differentiation in response to opportunistic extracellular pathogens in the absence of STAT3 signalling is arrested at an early stage of pre-Th17-cells that produce high levels of IL-10. These otherwise non-polarised T-cells acquired IFN-gamma production with IL-12 that could enable them to contain intracellular bacteria. These surprising findings demonstrates that Th17 differentiation is not completely blocked in the absence of STAT3 signalling, and that IL-10 production by human T-cells is STAT3-independent in vivo.">

        <tr id="The activation of innate immunity and associated interferon (IFN) signaling have been implicated in cancer, but the regulators are elusive and a link to tumor suppression undetermined. Here, we found that Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase altered in Parkinson's Disease was epigenetically silenced in cancer and its re-expression by clinically approved demethylating therapy stimulated transcription of a potent IFN response in tumor cells. This pathway required Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, involved the subcellular trafficking and release of the alarmin High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and was associated with inhibition of NFκB gene expression. In turn, Parkin-expressing cells released an IFN secretome that upregulated effector and cytotoxic CD8 T cell markers, lowered the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, TIM3 and LAG3, and stimulated high content of the self-renewal/stem cell factor, TCF1. Parkin-induced CD8 T cells selectively accumulated in the microenvironment and inhibited transgenic and syngeneic tumor growth, in vivo. Therefore, Parkin is an epigenetically regulated activator of innate immunity and dual mode tumor suppressor, inhibiting intrinsic tumor traits of metabolism and cell invasion, while simultaneously reinvigorating CD8 T cell functions in the microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Renal transplantation is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the challenge of transplant rejection and the complications associated with immunosuppressants necessitates a deeper understanding of the underlying immune mechanisms. T cell exhaustion, a state characterized by impaired effector functions and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors, plays a dual role in renal transplantation. While moderate T cell exhaustion can aid in graft acceptance by regulating alloreactive T cell responses, excessive exhaustion may impair the recipient’s ability to control viral infections and tumors, posing significant health risks. Moreover, drugs targeting T cell exhaustion to promote graft tolerance and using immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer treatment in transplant recipients are areas deserving of further attention and research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changes in T cell exhaustion levels after renal transplantation and their implications for graft survival and patient outcomes. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying T cell exhaustion, the role of specific exhaustion markers, the potential impact of immunosuppressive therapies, and the pharmaceutical intervention on T cell exhaustion levels. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential to modulate T cell exhaustion favorably, enhancing graft survival. Future research should focus on the distinctions of T cell exhaustion across different immune states and subsets, as well as the interactions between exhausted T cells and other immune cells. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing transplant outcomes and ensuring long-term graft survival while maintaining immune competence.">

        <tr id="The use of antitumor drugs represents a reliable strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become increasingly common and contributes to tumor metastasis and local recurrence. The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) consists of immune cells, cytokines and immunomodulators, and collectively they influence the response to treatment. Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as increased drug exportation have been reported to contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancers. In the past few years, the majority of studies on tumors have only focused on the development and progression of a tumor from a mechanistic standpoint; few studies have examined whether the changes in the TME can also affect tumor growth and drug resistance. Recently, emerging evidence have raised more concerns regarding the role of TME in the development of drug resistance. In the present review, it was discussed how the suppressive TME adapts to drug resistance characterized by the cooperation of immune cells, cytokines, immunomodulators, stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was reviewed how these immunological or metabolic changes alter immuno-surveillance and thus facilitate tumor drug resistance. In addition, potential targets present in the TME for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve individualized therapy for cancer treatment were revealed.">

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. Although serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) family members play crucial roles in tumors, their impact on tumor immunology remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of SRSF10 in HCC immunotherapy.


METHODS
To identify the key genes associated with immunotherapy resistance, we conducted single-nuclear RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, and The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses. We investigated the biological functions of SRSF10 in immune evasion using in vitro co-culture systems, flow cytometry, various tumor-bearing mouse models, and patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids.


RESULTS
SRSF10 was upregulated in various tumors and associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, SRSF10 positively regulated lactate production, and SRSF10/glycolysis/ histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) formed a positive feedback loop in tumor cells. Increased lactate levels promoted M2 macrophage polarization, thereby inhibiting CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, SRSF10 interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of MYB, enhancing MYB RNA stability, and subsequently upregulating key glycolysis-related enzymes including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), resulting in elevated intracellular and extracellular lactate levels. Lactate accumulation induced histone lactylation, which further upregulated SRSF10 expression. Additionally, lactate produced by tumors induced lactylation of the histone H3K18la site upon transport into macrophages, thereby activating transcription and enhancing pro-tumor macrophage activity. M2 macrophages, in turn, inhibited the enrichment of CD8+ T cells and the proportion of interferon-γ+CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus creating an immunosuppressive TME. Clinically, SRSF10 could serve as a biomarker for assessing immunotherapy resistance in various solid tumors. Pharmacological targeting of SRSF10 with a selective inhibitor 1C8 enhanced the efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in both murine and human preclinical models.


CONCLUSIONS
The SRSF10/MYB/glycolysis/lactate axis is critical for triggering immune evasion and anti-PD-1 resistance. Inhibiting SRSF10 by 1C8 may overcome anti-PD-1 tolerance in HCC.">

        <tr id="A key mediator of T cell impairment during respiratory virus infection is the inhibitory receptor PD-1. PD-1 is induced on T cells following antigen exposure, whereas proinflammatory cytokines upregulate the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Respiratory virus infection leads to upregulation of PD-L1 on airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and alveolar macrophages. However, the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in acute respiratory virus infections is not known. We sought to determine the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in CD8+ T cell impairment. We found that PD-L1-/- mice challenged with human metapneumovirus or influenza showed a similar level of CD8+ T cell impairment compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, virus clearance was delayed in PD-L1-/- mice compared to WT. CD8+ T cells from PD-L1-deficient mice expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors both at baseline and after respiratory virus infection. The antibody blockade of PD-L2 failed to restore function to the impaired cells. While reciprocal bone marrow chimeras between WT and PD-L1-/- mice did not restore CD8+ T cell function after the respiratory virus challenge, mice that received the PD-L1-/- bone marrow had higher inhibitory receptor expression on CD8+ cells. This discrepancy in the inhibitory receptor expression suggests that cells of the hematopoietic compartment contribute to T cell impairment on CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEThe phenomenon of pulmonary CD8+ T cell impairment with diminished antiviral function occurs during acute respiratory virus infection mediated by Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) signaling. Moreover, PD-1 blockade enhances T cell function to hasten viral clearance. The ligand PD-L1 is expressed in many cell types, but which cells drive lung T cell impairment is not known. We used genetic approaches to determine the contribution of PD-L1 on lung T cell impairment. We found that PD-L2 cannot compensate for the loss of PD-L1, and PD-L1-deficient mice exhibit increased expression of other inhibitory receptors. Bone marrow chimeras between PD-L1-deficient and wild-type mice indicated that hematopoietic PD-L1 expression is associated with inhibitory receptor upregulation and impairment.">

        <tr id="In both humans and mice, natural killer (NK) cells are important lymphocytes of the innate immune system. They are often considered pro-inflammatory effector cells but may also have a regulatory or pro-resolving function by switching their cytokine profile towards the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β, and by killing pro-inflammatory immune cells. Here, the role of NK cells in the resolution of malaria lung pathology was studied. Malaria complications, such as malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS), are often lethal despite the rapid and efficient killing of Plasmodium parasites with antimalarial drugs. Hence, studying the resolution and healing mechanisms involved in the recovery from these complications could be useful to develop adjunctive treatments. Treatment of Plasmodium berghei NK65-infected C57BL/6 mice with a combination of artesunate and chloroquine starting at the appearance of symptoms was used as a model to study the resolution of MA-ARDS. The role of NK cells was studied using anti-NK1.1 depletion antibodies and NK cell-deficient mice. Using both methods, NK cells were found to be dispensable in the development of MA-ARDS, as shown previously. In contrast, NK cells were crucial in the initiation of resolution upon antimalarial treatment, as survival was significantly decreased in the absence of NK cells. Considerably increased IL-10 expression by NK cells suggested an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving phenotype. Despite the increase in Il10 expression in the NK cells, inhibition of the IL-10/IL-10R axis using anti-IL10R antibodies had no effect on the resolution for MA-ARDS, suggesting that the pro-resolving effect of NK cells cannot solely be attributed to their IL-10 production. In conclusion, NK cells contribute to the resolution of experimental MA-ARDS.">

        <tr id="Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry.We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients.The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

        <tr id="Many chronic inflammatory diseases are attributed to disturbances in host-microbe interactions, which drive immune-mediated tissue damage. Depending on the anatomic setting, a chronic inflammatory disease can exert unique local and systemic influences, which provide an exceptional opportunity for understanding disease mechanism and testing therapeutic interventions. The oral cavity is an easily accessible environment that allows for protective interventions aiming at modulating the immune response to control disease processes driven by a breakdown of host-microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger nonresolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss, and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional, or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment up-regulated M2-macrophage and downregulated proinflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2-treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host-microbe homeostasis.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a survival rate under 12%. Treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy are ineffective in PDAC due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, in which tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are a major component. TAN immunosuppression has been shown to depend upon increased production of reactive oxygen species, with myeloperoxidase (MPO) being a major source of it. We investigated the contribution of MPO in mediating TAN immunosuppression using orthotopic PDAC models in wild-type and syngeneic MPO-deficient mice. We observed a significant delay in tumor growth and improved clinical scores when MPO was deficient. Additionally, treatment with the MPO-specific inhibitor Verdiperstat also delayed tumor growth. Flow cytometry analysis of the tumor microenvironment further confirmed a significant increase in CD8 T and NK cells, along with an increase in granzyme B level in both subsets, when MPO was deficient. Additionally, there was an increase in activation marker (CD25) and memory subset among both CD8 and CD4 T cells in MPO-deficient mice. Ex vivo studies with isolated TANs from tumor-bearing mice showed reduced CD8 T and NK cell suppression, and reactive oxygen species level in absence of MPO, supporting the contribution of MPO in TAN immunosuppression. These data suggest that loss of MPO in TANs has decreased immunosuppressive functions resulting in increased cytotoxic and activated T cells and NK cells with increased memory response within the tumor microenvironment. Our results demonstrate the contribution of MPO in regulating tumor progression, TAN immunosuppression, and immune cell infiltration using an orthotopic PDAC model.

        <tr id="Introduction The role of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)2 in anti-infective bacterial immunity has been poorly investigated compared to other members of the SOCS family. Methods We characterized the previously identified loss of function R96C point mutation of SOCS2 using a genome-edited mouse model that resumes the phenotype of Socs2 knockout mice. The response of macrophages to TLR-ligands and Staphylococcus aureus was examined. Results and discussion Conversely to previously published data using human monocyte-derived macrophages, the stimulation of bone-marrow-derived macrophages with various TLR ligands did not show any difference according to the SOCS2 variant. Upregulation of IL-6 and TNF-α pro-inflammatory cytokines production was only seen when the SOCS2 expression was promoted by the culture of macrophages in the presence of GM-CSF. Furthermore, we showed that the SOCS2 point mutation is associated with heightened STAT5 phosphorylation in a short time frame upon GM-CSF incubation. In mice, recruitment of neutrophil and F4/80int Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophage, as well as IFN-γ and IL-10 concentrations, are significantly increased upon S. aureus peritoneal infection. Altogether, these data support the idea that by lowering the pro-inflammatory environment, SOCS2 favors better control of bacterial burden during a systemic infection caused by S. aureus.">

Pharmacological inhibition as well as the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor hindered memory transition and limited the homeostatic turnover of the activated CD8+ T cells. Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, controlled glucocorticoid signaling within the effector CD8+ T cells is crucial for optimal memory differentiation.">

        <tr id="Maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and preventing harmful autoimmune reactions is a fundamental task of the immune system. However, these essential functions are significantly compromised during autoimmune disorders, creating a major challenge in treating these conditions. In this context, we provide an overview of research on small spleen polypeptides (SSPs) that naturally regulate peripheral immune tolerance. Alongside outlining the observed effects of SSPs, we summarize here the findings on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie their regulatory impact. Specifically, SSPs have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in halting the progression of developing or established autoimmune disorders like psoriasis or arthritis in animal models. They primarily target dendritic cells (DCs), swiftly prompting the production of extracellular ATP, which is then degraded and sensed by adenosine receptors. This process triggers the mTOR signaling cascade, similar to powerful immune triggers, but instead of a rapid and intense reaction, it leads to a moderate yet significant activation of the mTOR signaling cascade. This induces a tolerogenic state in dendritic cells, ultimately leading to the generation of Foxp3+ immunosuppressor Treg cells. In addition, SSPs may indirectly attenuate the autoimmune response by reducing extracellular ATP synthesis in non-immune cells, such as endothelial cells, when exposed to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. SSPs thus have the potential to contribute to the restoration of peripheral immune tolerance and may offer valuable therapeutic benefits in treating autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Drugs that target immune checkpoint have become the most popular weapon in cancer immunotherapy, yet only have practical benefits for a small percentage of patients. Tumor cells constantly interact with their microenvironment, which is made up of a variety of immune cells as well as endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Immune checkpoint expression and blocked signaling of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are key to tumor progression. In this study, we perform deliberation convolution on the TCGA database for human lung, breast, and colorectal cancer to infer crosstalk between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and ligands (ICLs) in TME of pan-carcinogenic solid tumor types, validated by flow cytometry. Analysis of immune checkpoints showed that there was little variation between different tumor types. It showed that CD160, LAG3, TIGIT were found to be highly expressed in CD8+ T cells instead of CD4+ T cells, PD-L1, PD-L2, CD86, LGALS9, TNFRSF14, LILRB4 and other ligands were highly expressed on macrophages, FVR, NECTIN2, FGL1 were highly expressed on Epithelial cells, CD200 was highly expressed in Endothelial cells, and CD80 was highly expressed in CD8 High expression on T cells. Overall, our study provides a new resource for the expression of immune checkpoints in TME on various types of cells. Significance: This study provides immune checkpoint expression of immune cells of multiple cancer types to infer immune mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and provide ideas for the development of new immune checkpoint-blocking drugs.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune cell populations in the intestinal muscularis propria during colitis are poorly resolved. Maintaining homeostasis in this niche is critical, highlighted by the poorer prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease associated with muscularis propria inflammation.


METHODS
This study utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the immune cell populations within the muscularis propria of normal colon and dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Findings are validated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and cell-lineage tracing in vivo, and in vitro assays with muscularis macrophages (MMφ).


RESULTS
In naïve conditions, transcriptional duality is observed in MMφs with 2 major subpopulations: conventional resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs and Lyve1+ MMφs. The Lyve1+ population is phagocytic and expresses several known MMφ markers in mouse and human, confirming their identity as a bona fide MMφ subset. Single-cell transcriptomics indicate that resident MMφs are retained during colitis and exhibit plasticity toward an inflammatory profile. Lyve1+ MMφs, which express anti-inflammatory marker CD163, are absent during colitis, as confirmed by flow cytometry. In contrast, lineage tracing finds that resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs remain during colitis and are not completely replaced by the inflammatory infiltrating monocytes. In vitro studies provide biological evidence of the plasticity of resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mirroring transcriptional observations in vivo of their inflammatory plasticity. Potential markers for colitic MMφs, validated in animal models and in individuals with ulcerative colitis, are identified.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings contribute to the understanding of the immune system in the muscularis propria niche during colitis by resolving the heterogeneity and origins of colitic MMφs.">

While DCs are believed to play a pivotal role in generating anti-tumor T-cell responses, the importance of DCs in the protection from the progression of tumors remains elusive. Here, we show how the constitutive deficiency of CD11chi DCs influences the progression of tumors with the use of binary transgenic mice with constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs. Constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs not only enhances the progression of tumors but also reduces the responses of Ag-specific T cells. Furthermore, the congenital deficiency of CD11chi DCs generates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that correlates with the marked accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the prominent productions of immunosuppressive mediators. Thus, our findings suggest that CD11chi DCs are crucial for generating anti-tumor T-cell responses and immunogenic TME to suppress the development of tumors.">

        <tr id="Background: Exosomal programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), an exosomal membrane protein found in many tumor types, is reckoned to help regulate the immune microenvironment. However, the functions and the mechanisms underlying the exosome-mediated regulation of the immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown. Methods: Western blotting was used to investigate the levels of exosomal PD-L1 in the peripheral blood of patients with CRC and healthy controls. A CRC mouse model was constructed by administering 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) and dextrane sodium sulfate (DSS) intraperitoneally. The mice were then administered the control or CRC-derived exosomes to examine the regulatory effect of the exosomes on macrophage infiltration and CRC development. In vitro studies, using a coculture system, and flow cytometry analysis were conducted to examine the relationship between the regulatory effect of CRC-derived exosomes on CD4+ T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. RNA-seq and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulatory effect of the CRC-derived exosomes on macrophage proliferation and the regulation of the immune microenvironment during CRC development. Results: In patients with CRC, higher levels of exosomal PD-L1 were associated with a more severe form of disease. The treatment of mice with AOM/DSS-induced CRC with CRC-derived exosomes resulted in high levels of macrophage proliferation, increased PD-L1 levels in macrophages, and accelerated CRC progression. Importantly, analysis of an in vitro coculture system and flow cytometry analysis showed that the CRC-derived exosomes transported PD-L1 into macrophages and impaired CD4+ T cell function. Preliminary data suggest that the NF-κb signaling pathway regulates the function of CRC-derived exosomal PD-L1-dependent macrophages. Conclusion: CRC-derived exosomes induce the proliferation of macrophages and increase their PD-L1 levels. They also impair CD4+ T cell function and promote CRC progression. Our findings reveal a novel exosomal PD-L1-mediated crosstalk between the CRC cells and immune cells in the CRC microenvironment.">

Here, using a 3D co-culture system based on human intestinal epithelial organoids, we explore the capacity of IFNγ-exposure to reprogram intestinal epithelia and thereby directly modulate lymphocyte responses. IFNγ treatment of organoids led to transcriptional reprogramming, marked by a switch to a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, including transcriptional upregulation of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Proteomic analysis of organoid-conditioned medium post-treatment confirmed chemokine secretion. IFNγ-treatment of organoids led to enhanced T cell migration in a CXCL11-dependent manner without affecting T cell activation status. Taken together, our results suggest a specific role for CXCL11 in T cell recruitment that could be targeted to prevent T cell trafficking to the inflamed intestine.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has achieved important clinical advances in several types of tumors, particularly via targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. However, existing therapeutic strategies that suppress the PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway usually experience low treatment efficacy and the risk of causing autoimmune diseases. Herein, we report a cancer cell-targeted molecularly imprinted lysosomal nanodegrader (MILND) for boosting immune checkpoint blockade therapy against tumors. The MILND, imprinted with the N-terminal epitope of PD-L1 as an imprinting template, could specifically target the PD-L1 on tumor cells to promote cellular uptake. This process further induces the transport of PD-L1 into lysosomes for degradation, ultimately resulting in the downregulation of PD-L1 expression levels on tumor cells. As a result, a T cell-mediated immune response in the body was activated via the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, which triggered a durable antitumor efficacy. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MILND could effectively accumulate in tumor sites and exhibit strong tumor growth suppression efficacy in a xenograft tumor model without obvious side effects. Therefore, the MILND provides not only a promising strategy for boosting cancer immunotherapy but also insights for developing molecular imprinting-empowered nanomedicines.">

        <tr id="The thymus plays a pivotal role in generating a highly-diverse repertoire of T lymphocytes while preventing autoimmunity. Thymus seeding progenitors (TSPs) are a heterogeneous group of multipotent progenitors that migrate to the thymus via CCR7 and CCR9 receptors. While NOTCH guides thymus progenitors toward T cell fate, the absence or disruption of NOTCH signaling renders the thymus microenvironment permissive to other cell fates. Following T cell commitment, developing T cells undergo multiple selection checkpoints by engaging with the extracellular matrix, and interacting with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and other immune subsets across the different compartments of the thymus. The different selection checkpoints assess the T cell receptor (TCR) performance, with failure resulting in either repurposing (agonist selection), or cell death. Additionally, environmental cues such as inflammation and endocrine signaling induce acute thymus atrophy, contributing to the demise of most developing T cells during thymic selection. We discuss the occurrence of acute thymus atrophy in response to systemic inflammation. The thymus demonstrates high plasticity, shaping inflammation by abrogating T cell development and undergoing profound structural changes, and facilitating regeneration and restoration of T cell development once inflammation is resolved. Despite the challenges, thymic selection ensures a highly diverse T cell repertoire capable of discerning between self and non-self antigens, ultimately egressing to secondary lymphoid organs where they complete their maturation and exert their functions.">

        <tr id="HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive demyelinating disease of the spinal cord due to chronic inflammation. Hallmarks of disease pathology include dysfunctional anti-viral responses and the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system. HAM/TSP individuals exhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with elevated co-expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), but ICP blockade strategies can only partially restore CD8+ T-cell effector function. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles, can enhance the spread of viral infections and blunt anti-viral responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of exosomes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells and HAM/TSP patient sera on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell phenotypes and function. We observed that exosomes derived from HTLV-infected cell lines (OSP2) elicit proinflammatory cytokine responses in DCs, promote helper CD4+ T-cell polarization, and suppress CD8+ T-cell effector function. Furthermore, exosomes from individuals with HAM/TSP stimulate CD4+ T-cell polarization, marked by increased Th1 and regulatory T-cell differentiation. We conclude that exosomes in the setting of HAM/TSP are detrimental to DC and T-cell function and may contribute to the progression of pathology with HTLV-1 infection.">

Natural killer (NK) cells, one of the main tumor-killing immune cell populations, have received increasing attention in HNSCC immunotherapy. In this review, we explore the mechanism underlying the interplay between NK cells and HNSCC. A series of immune evasion strategies utilized by cancer cells restrict HNSCC infiltration of NK cells. Overcoming these limitations can fully exploit the antineoplastic potential of NK cells. We also investigated the tumor-killing efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapies, immunotherapeutic strategies, and new results from clinical trials. Notably, cetuximab, the most essential component of NK cell-based immunotherapy, inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and activates the immune system in conjunction with NK cells, inducing innate effector functions and improving patient prognosis. In addition, we compiled information on other areas for the improvement of patient prognosis using anti-EGFR receptor-based monoclonal antibody drugs and the underlying mechanisms and prognoses of new immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of HNSCC.">

        <tr id="Background: Breast cancer represents one of the leading causes of death among women. Surgery can be effective, but once breast cancer has metastasized, it becomes extremely difficult to treat. Conventional therapies are associated with substantial toxicity and poor efficacy due to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance and disease relapse. Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade appears to offer limited benefit in breast cancer. The poor tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment result in scarce T-cell infiltration, leading to a low response rate. Thus, there is considerable interest in the development of improved active immunotherapies capable of sensitizing a patient’s immune system against tumor cells. Methods: We evaluated the in vitro anti-tumor activity of a personalized vaccine based on dendritic cells generated in the presence of interferon (IFN)-α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (IFN-DC) and loaded with an oxidized lysate from autologous tumor cells expanded as 3D organoid culture maintaining faithful tumor antigenic profiles. Results: Our findings demonstrate that stimulation of breast cancer patients’ lymphocytes with autologous IFN-DC led to efficient Th1-biased response and the generation in vitro of potent cytotoxic activity toward the patients’ own tumor cells. Conclusions: This approach can be potentially applied in association with checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy in the design of new combinatorial therapies for breast cancer.">

Very-early-differentiated stem cell memory T cells (TSCMs) have superior self-renewal, engraftment, persistence, and anticancer efficacy, but their potential for antiviral ACT remains unknown. Here, we developed a clinically scalable protocol for expanding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific TSCM-enriched T cells with high proportions of CD4+ T cells and broad EBV antigen coverage. These cells showed tumor control in a xenograft model of EBV-induced lymphoma and were superior to previous ACT protocols in terms of tumor infiltration, in vivo proliferation, persistence, proportion of functional CD4+ T cells, and diversity of EBV antigen specificity. Thus, our protocol may pave the way for the next generation of potent unmodified antigen-specific cell therapies for EBV-associated diseases, including tumors, and other indications.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death among infectious diseases, with 10.6 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths reported in 2022, according to the most recent WHO report. Early studies have shown an expansion of γδ T cells following TB infection in both experimental models and humans, indicating their abundance among lung lymphocytes and suggesting a role in protective immune responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection. In this study, we hypothesized that distinct subsets of γδ T cells are associated with either protection against or disease progression in TB. To explore this, we applied large-scale scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data integration to define the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of peripheral blood γδ T cells. Our analysis identified five unique γδ T subclusters, each with distinct functional profiles. Notably, we identified a unique cluster significantly enriched in the TCR signaling pathway, with high CD81 expression as a conserved marker. This distinct molecular signature suggests a specialized role for this cluster in immune signaling and regulation of immune response against M. tuberculosis. Flow cytometry confirmed our in silico results, showing that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of CD81 expression on γδ T cells were significantly increased in individuals with latent TB infection (TBI) compared to those with active TB (ATB). This finding underscores the importance of CD81 and its associated signaling mechanisms in modulating the activity and function of γδ T cells under TBI conditions, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for TB management.">

Noteworthy, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) have been recently acknowledged as an important class of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the context of host–microorganism interactions shaping the adaptive immune response in the intestinal mucosa. Although a broad range of mouse models has led to significant progress in untangling the role of ILC3s as APCs, the outcome of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent ILC-T cell crosstalk in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains underexplored in human. Moreover, expression of MHCII is confined to ILC3 subset, endowed with lymphoid tissue-inducing properties, that adopts tissue-specific fates and functions. Intestinal microbiota could dictate the plasticity of antigen-presenting ILC3s and we here summarize our current understanding of the functions of these cells in both mouse and human CRC discussing the role of microbiota as a key modulator of their tumor-suppressive activity.">

        <tr id="A better understanding of sepsis-induced immunosuppression pathophysiology is desirable for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and reduce the rates of secondary infections and their associated mortality. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1+CD44+B220LowCD138+IgM+ regulatory plasma cells (PCs) are induced in a murine model of sepsis-induced immune alterations and in critically ill patients with bacterial sepsis and COVID-19. This was revealed both by detailed analysis of their phenotypical features and gene expression profile and by functional explorations comparing capacity of purified B cells and PCs to suppress T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} secretion ex vivo. Sepsis-induced regulatory PCs exerted their suppressive function on T cells through IL-10 production and increased PD-L1 expression independently of regulatory T cells. Our findings thus reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis-induced immunosuppression that involves regulatory PCs. As such, these PCs constitute valid therapeutic targets to improve immune cell functions impaired by sepsis.">

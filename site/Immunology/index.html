        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play pivotal roles in modulating therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. While B cells have traditionally been viewed as bystanders in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests they may actively influence anti-tumor immunity, albeit with conflicting reports regarding their pro-tumor or anti-tumor roles. This study explores the crucial roles played by B cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping melanoma responses to ICB therapy. We show a significant enrichment of B cells in ICB therapy responders compared to non-responders, pre-treatment, through retrospective analyses of melanoma patient tumors. Functional assays demonstrate that B cell depletion impairs T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, underscoring the importance of B cells in anti-tumor responses. To investigate the clinical relevance, EVs were isolated from melanoma patient tumors, and fractioned into tumor and immune subpopulations. MiRNA profiling of CD19+ EVs identifies miR-99a-5p as a top candidate, among several others, upregulated in responders. Functional assays show that miR-99a-5p silencing in B cells diminishes T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity, suggesting its role in promoting B cell-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p influences B cell maturation within the TME by mediating class-switch recombination. Our findings highlight the important role of B cells and their derived EVs in shaping the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell-related pathways.

        <tr id="The significance of endogenous immune surveillance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains controversial. Using clinical B-ALL samples and a novel mouse model, we show that neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells are induced to adopt type-1 regulatory (Tr1) function in the leukemia microenvironment. Tr1s then inhibit cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, preventing effective leukemia clearance. Leukemic cells induce Tr1s by phenocopying hematopoietic stem cells, which normally are subject to effective surveillance by this CD4+ subset. This mechanism effectively redirects Tr1 cells from a role in preventing cancer to maladaptively promoting clinical relapse. In mouse models, inhibition of Tr1 expansion with IL10 receptor (IL10R) blockade is insufficient to improve leukemia control. In contrast, combined therapy with a cytotoxic agent and anti-PDL1 blockade eradicated measurable residual disease. This correlates with polarization of the neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cell population from Tr1 towards Th1 states. Our findings uncover a mechanism that enables leukemic relapse and resolves existing controversies on the role of immune surveillance towards this cancer type. Therapeutic polarization of neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells towards Th1 states may improve contemporary immune therapies by reshaping the immune microenvironment towards states permissive for cytotoxic attack of residual leukemia. Key Points B-ALL induces neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells to adopt Type-1 regulatory states, which protect leukemic cells from immune pressure. Repolarizing neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cells towards Th1 states eradicates measurable residual disease.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR-T cell treatment remains incompletely understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analyses of bone marrow-resident immune cells from B-ALL patients before and after CAR T-cell treatment. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation, including an increase in myeloid cells. Significant induction of the IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells. PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response in the cohort of patients analyzed. Further, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell dysfunction. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells led to increased accumulation of human MDSCs, exacerbation of a hypoxic environment and T-cell exhaustion in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. In conclusion, CAR T-cell-mediated myeloid activation is associated with pathways of immune dysregulation that may antagonize the effects of therapy. Key points The tumor immune context post-treatment affects CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling result in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromise CAR T-cell efficacy.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells play a critical role in supporting antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses. Although these responses often coexist, one can sometimes dominate at the expense of the other. For instance, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a strong cellular immune response but generates a suboptimal neutralizing antibody (nAb) response, hindering viral clearance and enabling persistent infection. Recent findings indicate that this skewed preference toward cellular immunity is determined already during the differentiation of CD4+ T cells. Specifically, subcutaneous (s.c.) LCMV infection predominantly induces T-bet+ T helper 1 (TH1) differentiation while largely neglecting T follicular helper (TFH) differentiation, a key driver of humoral immunity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for this impaired TFH differentiation. We found that T-bet+ cells induced by s.c. LCMV infection are heterogeneous and encompass a terminally differentiated TH1 subset expressing Granzyme-B (GzmB) and a Tcf-1+ subset that retains the potential for TFH differentiation but that does not express CXCR5 and other mature TFH markers. Interestingly, T cell-derived IFN-γ facilitated the proliferation of the GzmB+ subset and inhibited Tcf-1+ cells’ progression into TFH. The suppression of TFH cells by IFN-γ was not directly mediated through CD4+ T cells but rather involved another cell type, likely dendritic cells. Consistently, inhibition of IFN-γ enabled robust TFH differentiation, formation of germinal centers and increased antibody production. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms inhibiting nAb production in response to viruses and lays a foundation for the development of advanced vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Monocytes are essential for replenishing homeostatic macrophages in the intestine. However, they also accumulate in significant numbers when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The molecular pathways governing monocyte behaviour across these different contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of monocytes that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs). These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate increased expression of IBD susceptibility genes. By performing cross-species analysis, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis in mice. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete precursor in the bone marrow (BM) and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans. Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production. Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health.">

        <tr id="Phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cancer cells (efferocytosis) by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contributes in a substantial manner to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This puts in context our observation that the female steroid hormone 17β- estradiol (E2) facilitates tumor immune resistance through cancer cell extrinsic Estrogen Receptor (ERα) signaling in TAMs. Notable was the finding that E2 induces the expression of CX3CR1 in TAMs to enable efferocytosis of apoptotic cancer cells which results in the suppression of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Mechanistically, E2 facilitates calcium-dependent activation of the transcription factor NFATC1, which in turn induces CX3CR1 expression. This drives macrophage polarization towards an immune-suppressive state, increasing the ability of TAMs to engulf pro- inflammatory apoptotic cancer cells. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the E2/ER/CX3CR1 axis reversed the efferocytic activity of TAMs, rescued E2-dependent suppression of type I IFN signaling, and potentiated intratumoral adaptive immune cell function. Efferocytosis following radiation-induced cancer cell apoptosis limits the efficacy of radiation therapy. Importantly, we determined that preconditioning with either ER-directed endocrine therapies or CX3CR1 inhibition enhanced the antitumor efficacy of radiation therapy by reversing macrophage suppression and reviving intratumoral T cell activation. Our work defines the mechanisms by which E2 increases the efferocytotic activity of TAMs to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and demonstrates how this process can be reversed with endocrine therapies which target ERα.">

        <tr id="Fibroblasts are present in all tissues and are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis. We previously identified fibroblasts marked by Dermatopontin (Dpt) but their role in supporting macrophage homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we generated novel mesenchymal lineage-restricted genetic tools to target Dpt expressing fibroblasts and elucidate their role in supporting skin macrophages. Transcriptional profiling, flow cytometry, and in situ hybridization uncovered two broad populations of F4/80-expressing skin macrophages, denoted by high expression of CD206 and CD64 (CD206hiCD64+), or CD11c. Targeted depletion of Dpt+ fibroblasts resulted in a profound loss of both macrophage populations. Conditional deletion of colony-stimulating factor-1 (Csf1) in Dpt+ fibroblasts revealed that CD206hiCD64+, and not CD11c+, macrophages are acutely dependent on fibroblast-derived Csf1, consistent with their higher expression of the Csf1 receptor. Following Csf1 deletion in Dpt+ fibroblasts, loss of CD206hiCD64+ macrophages were observed across the dermis, dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT), and adventitia, accompanied by a modest upregulation of fibroblast-related and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and structural changes to the skin. Alterations to the skin network upon loss of fibroblast-derived Csf1 and CD206hiCD64+ macrophages led to a significant delay in wound healing. We also demonstrate the CSF1-CSF1R signaling pathway is functionally relevant in human systemic sclerosis, or scleroderma, as elevated levels of CSF1 produced by fibroblasts and an increased abundance of macrophages both correlate with disease severity. Our findings demonstrate the role of Dpt+ fibroblasts in regulating a Csf1-dependent macrophage niche in skin and orchestrating responses in injury and disease.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly fibrotic and stiff tumor, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are pivotal in driving ECM remodeling, PDAC progression and immune evasion. The contribution of mechanical cues to monocyte differentiation into TAMs remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mechanical force is required for monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. PYK2, as an innovative immunomechanical checkpoint, de facto governs this differentiation process. We demonstrated that PYK2 responds to mechanical signals within the tumor microenvironment (TME) via Piezo1 and integrins, leading to its activation and subsequent F-actin polymerization. Activated PYK2 then translocates to the nucleus, where it engages with promoters of genes governing mechanotransduction and differentiation, including ACTR3 and RELA. Targeted deletion of PYK2 impairs the differentiation and polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages, reshapes the PDAC microenvironment, and enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings underscore the critical role of mechanical cues in monocyte differentiation and suggest that targeting PYK2 is a promising strategy to modulate TAM function and improve immunotherapy outcomes in patients with PDAC.">

Unraveling how defective signaling pathways contribute to their activation and persistence is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets. We profiled a highly arthritogenic subset of naïve CD4+ T cells using bulk and single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing from SKG mice, which develop CD4+ T cell mediated autoimmune arthritis driven by a hypomorphic mutation in Zap70-a key TCR signaling kinase. Despite impaired signaling, these cells exhibit heightened expression of T cell activation and cytokine signaling genes, but diminished expression of a subset of tolerogenic markers (Izumo1r, Tnfrsf9, Cd5, S100a11) compared to wild-type cells. The arthritogenic cells show an enrichment for TCR variable beta (Vβ) chains targeting superantigens from the endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) but exhibit diminished induction of tolerogenic markers following peripheral antigen encounter, contrasting with the robust induction of negative regulators seen in wild-type cells. In arthritic joints, cells expressing superantigen-reactive Vβs expand alongside detectable MMTV proviruses. Antiretroviral treatment and superantigen-reactive T cell depletion curtail SKG arthritis, suggesting that endogenous retroviruses disrupt peripheral tolerance and promote the activation and differentiation of self-reactive CD4+ T cells into pathogenic effector cells.">

This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Tumor clearance by T cells is impaired by insufficient tumor antigen recognition, insufficient tumor infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance by these T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promises to reverse T cell suppression in the TME and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. CPIs require the target pathway of inhibition to be active in the TME to elicit a therapeutic response. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of serial killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function against HR+ cancers. Our model provides a means to optimize targets for CPIs used in combination with BATs in clinical strategies. What is already known on this topic Bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapies are adoptive T cell therapies that can effectively reroute T cell cytotoxicity toward cancerous cells, but lack consistent and durable anti-tumor responses. Checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of activated T cells dampen immune responses and can be overstimulated in solid tumors to hamper tumor clearance by T cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs can improve T cell anti-tumor response by blocking checkpoint protein signaling but are only effective if the targeted checkpoint protein is expressed on the T cell and activated in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an opportunity to enhance BAT efficacy by combining treatment with synergistic CPI. What this study adds This study characterizes dynamic, time-resolved patterns in checkpoint protein expression by breast cancer-targeting adoptive T cells and predicts the significance of high-prevalence checkpoint proteins on T cell function. It also demonstrates the use of multivariate statistic and mathematical modeling toward rational design of targets and timing strategies for synergistic combination therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy The output of this study provides justification for therapeutic strategies combining adoptive T cell therapies with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting TIGIT and LAG3 as a means of improving patient responses in HER2-/HR+ breast cancers.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="The persistence of HIV-1 reservoirs during combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) leads to chronic immune activation and systemic inflammation in people with HIV (PWH), associating with a suboptimal immune reconstitution as well as an increased risk of non-AIDS events. This highlights the needs to develop novel therapy for HIV-1 related diseases in PWH. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of CD24-Fc, a fusion protein with anti-inflammatory properties that interacts with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and siglec-10, in chronic HIV-1 infection model using humanized mice undergoing suppressive cART. Our findings show that CD24-Fc treatment significantly reduced inflammation and immune hyperactivation in vivo when combined with cART. CD24-Fc mediated resolution of inflammation was associated with improved recovery of CD4 T cells, reduced immune activation, restored central memory T cells and reversal of immune cell exhaustion phenotype. Notably, CD24-Fc treatment rescued CXCR5+ CD8 central memory T cell (TCM) which correlated with increased polyfunctionality in HIV-specific T cells in humanized mice and in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWH. This restoration of CXCR5+ memory CD8 T cells was associated with HIV replication inhibition, delayed viral rebound and reduced HIV-1 pathogenesis upon cART cessation. This study suggests that CD24-Fc treatment could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for managing chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH. Author summary Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) cannot block viral gene expression from activated HIV proviral DNA in reservoir cells, contributing to chronic immune activation and inflammation associated diseases in people with HIV (PWH). The therapeutic treatment of anti-inflammatory fusion protein CD24-Fc in humanized mice during suppressive cART (i) resolves inflammation and chronic HIV-1 immune pathogenesis during suppressive cART, (ii) rescues CXCR5-expressing CD8 memory T cells and enhances antiviral response in humanized mice and PWH PBMCs, (iii) delays virus rebound and reduces viral pathogenesis after cART cessation. Thus, CD24-Fc could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD1) can be effective in treating advanced cancers. However, many patients do not respond and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B-cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially co-localize with T-cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We discover that pre-treatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing. These findings underscore a dynamic role of B cell diversity during immunotherapy, highlighting its importance as a prognostic marker and a potential target for intervention in non-responders.">

        <tr id="Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that in humans can be broadly classified into two main subtypes based on their unique TCRδ chain, Vδ1 and Vδ2. Both subsets have potent anti-tumor properties and the presence of Vδ1 cells in the tumor is often associated with positive prognosis. Herein, we investigated the molecular interplay between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), IC blockade (ICB) therapy and γδ T cells. We show that ICRs display differential expression and regulation by the JAK-STAT pathway in circulating Vδ1 and Vδ2 cells and identify constitutive (e.g. TIGIT, PD-1) and inducible (e.g. TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4) ICRs. In melanoma, Vδ1 cells, especially in patients who did not respond to ICB or required combination therapy, expressed high levels of ICR, TOX and inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) transcripts, reminiscent of an exhaustion transcriptional signature. At the same time all γδ T cells had a prominent downregulation in AP-1 transcription factors. Patient derived cells were functionally competent, although induction of LAG-3 and CTLA-4 was impaired. In the context of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Vδ1 cells specifically bound high levels of therapeutic antibody but only in patients who responded to treatment, revealing a potential new prognostic marker for evaluating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Finally, expression of KIR genes in Vδ1 cells was downregulated in response to successful ICB therapy. Collectively, our data indicate an intricate relationship between ICRs, putatively also KIRs, and γδ T cells and reveal novel approaches by which these cells can be harnessed in order to discern or improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Patients with cancer often receive chemotherapy to control tumor progression and reduce disease symptoms. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents not only kill rapidly growing cancer cells but also reduce normal cells including myeloid cells, the main innate immune population involved in fighting infections and repairing tissue damages. Rapid loss of myeloid cells caused by chemotherapy triggers myelopoiesis, a process in which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow regenerate myeloid cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, to reconstitute the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported that chemotherapy with an alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice leads to repopulation of myeloid cells that acquire immunosuppressive activities within the monocyte subset. However, detailed information on the cellular composition and molecular identity of these chemotherapy- induced immunosuppressive monocytes is lacking. Here, we investigated how the various myeloid cell subsets in the bone marrow of mice respond to CTX chemotherapy through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq). We found that myeloid progenitor cells and monocytes were reduced 2 days after chemotherapy but rebounded and surpassed their pretreatment levels by day 7. Further scRNAseq analysis of pre-enriched monocytes revealed that the monocyte population was heterogenous, and that chemotherapy tilted myelopoiesis towards the production of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo). We identified Cxcr4 and Cx3cr1 as suitable markers for isolation of chemotherapy-induced NeuMo and demonstrated that these cells were suppressive to T cells. Together with the evidence that CTX-induced monocytes can promote breast cancer metastasis in mice, our data reveal the heterogeneity of the monocytes reemerging after chemotherapy and identify the NeuMo subset as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer.">

We previously showed, in immunodeficient context, that antimitotic chemotherapy induced cGAS/STING pathway amplifying antitumor response through a paracrine IFN-1 secretome. We herein studied tumor progression and response to treatment using an immunocompetent murine model. scRNAseq analysis revealed that paclitaxel treatment altered tumor cell phenotypes, favoring tumor cells with a gene expression signature indicative of active NF-κB pathway with secretory phenotype. Treatment coincidently reduced IFN-I signature cells during tumor progression. The resulting secretory shift correlated with neutrophil recruitment to the tumor, particularly CXCR2+ neutrophils, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 receptor by navarixin reactivated antitumor immunity, enhancing NK cell infiltration and tumor cytotoxicity. Navarixin combination with paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor volume and metastasis. Targeting the NF-κB-driven secretory phenotype, in particular through neutrophil modulation, holds promise for improving TNBC treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune cells determine the role of the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression, either suppressing tumor formation or promoting tumorigenesis. We analyzed the profile of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of control mouse skins and skin tumors at the single-cell level. We identified 15 CD45+ immune cell clusters, which broadly represent the most functionally characterized immune cell types including macrophages, Langerhans cells (LC), conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2), migratory/mature dendritic cells (mDC), dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC), dermal γδ T cells (γδT), T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer cells (NK), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), neutrophils (Neu), mast cells (Mast), and two proliferating populations (Prolif.1 and Prolif.2). Skin tumor progression reprogramed immune cells and led to a marked increase in the relative percentages of macrophages, cDC2, mDC, Tregs, and Neu. Macrophages, the largest cell cluster of immune cells in skin tumors. In addition, macrophages emerged as the predominant communication ‘hub’ in skin tumors, highlighting the importance of macrophages during skin tumor progression. In contrast, other immune cell clusters decreased during skin tumor progression, including DETC, γδT, ILC2, and LC. In addition, skin tumor progression dramatically upregulated Jak2/Stat3 expression and the interferon response across various immune cell clusters. Further, skin tumor progression activated T cells and NK cells indicated by elevated expression of IFN-γ and Granzyme B in skin tumors. Meanwhile, a pronounced infiltration of M2-macrophages and Tregs in skin tumors created an immunosuppressive microenvironment, consistent with the elevated expression of the Stat3 pathway in skin tumors. In summary, our study elucidates the immune cell landscape of epidermal neoplasms, offering a comprehensive understanding of the immune response during skin tumor progression and providing new insights into cancer immune evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background Hepatocellular carcinoma represents a significant global health challenge, affecting over a million patients annually, arising mainly from chronic liver diseases, with a majority being related to viral infections. However, despite the groundbreaking clinical results of immune checkpoint blockades and adoptive cell therapies, we still face non-responders accompanied by high rebound rates after resection. Considering that the main concern is to overcome a highly specialized immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of the individual patient, the characterization of the particular tumor microenvironment and the source of the immune cells used in ACT is of immense importance. Approved ACT therapies mainly use modified peripheral blood cells from individuals. At the same time, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are underrepresented even if they have garnered interest due to their potential to target tumor-specific antigens more effectively. Methods In this study, we employed allogenic and autologous immune cell sources for expansion and stimulation, resulting in adoptive T-cell transfer experiments determining the effector cell differentiation and the related anti-tumor effects by the possible implementation of re-stimulation. Results We determined a high success rate in expanding and stimulating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with consistent CD8 T-cell fractions from HCC patients. To showcase the effectiveness of stimulated T-cells from different sources, we generated cell lines derived from the margin and center of an HBV-induced HCC with a highly immune-suppressive TME. We found effective immune responses supported by cell death induction, ferroptosis, proptosis and apoptosis triggered by all sources of T-cells depending on the area of derived tumor cells. Conclusion Effector T-cell fractions derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes present a viable source for cell-based immune therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in HCC patients, especially after resection, to suppress rebound strategies of the parental tumor on an individual level.">

        <tr id="Macrophages hold tremendous promise as effectors of cancer immunotherapy, but the best strategies to provoke these cells to attack tumors remain unknown. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting two distinct macrophage immune checkpoints: CD47 and CD24. We found that antibodies targeting these antigens could elicit maximal levels of phagocytosis when combined together in vitro. However, to our surprise, via unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screens, we found that CD24 primarily acts as a target of opsonization rather than an immune checkpoint. In a series of in vitro and in vivo genetic validation studies, we found that CD24 was neither necessary nor sufficient to protect cancer cells from macrophage phagocytosis in most mouse and human tumor models. Instead, anti-CD24 antibodies exhibit robust Fc-dependent activity, and as a consequence, they cause significant on-target hematologic toxicity in mice. To overcome these challenges and leverage our findings for therapeutic purposes, we engineered a collection of 77 novel bispecific antibodies that bind to a tumor antigen with one arm and engage macrophages with the second arm. We discovered multiple novel bispecifics that maximally activate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and reduce binding to healthy blood cells, including bispecifics targeting macrophage immune checkpoint molecules in combination with EGFR, TROP2, and CD71. Overall, our findings indicate that CD47 predominates over CD24 as a macrophage immune checkpoint in cancer, and that the novel bispecifics we created may be optimal immunotherapies to direct myeloid cells to eradicate solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Immune exclusion inhibits anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy, but its mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (TROP2), a key target of emerging anti-cancer Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), controls barrier-mediated immune exclusion in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) through Claudin 7 association and tight junction regulation. TROP2 expression is inversely correlated with T cell infiltration and strongly associated with outcomes in TNBC. Loss-of-function and reconstitution experiments demonstrate TROP2 is sufficient to drive tumor progression in vivo in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner, while its loss deregulates expression and localization of multiple tight junction proteins, enabling T cell infiltration. Employing a humanized TROP2 syngeneic TNBC model, we show that TROP2 targeting via hRS7, the antibody component of Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), enhances the anti-PD1 response associated with improved T cell accessibility and effector function. Correspondingly, TROP2 expression is highly associated with lack of response to anti-PD1 therapy in human breast cancer. Thus, TROP2 controls an immune exclusion program that can be targeted to enhance immunotherapy response. Synopsis This study defines a new mechanism of barrier-mediated immune exclusion in cancer controlled by TROP2-dependent tight junctions. This mechanism drives tumor progression but can be targeted via TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugates to activate anti-tumor immunity and enhance immunotherapy response.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes play a major role in intestinal homeostasis, with a particular impact on the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In Crohn’s disease (CD) patients, the intestinal mucosa is inflamed, epithelium permeability is increased, and IECs present compositional and functional defects. The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location. We show that while in homeostatic context T cells support the proliferation and differentiation balance of organoids, mucosal T lymphocytes from CD patients present a high cytotoxicity against IECs. Importantly, this cytotoxicity is a persistent defect overtime in culture. Organoids also show defective intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation and morphological changes. Single cell RNA sequencing after coculture highlights a general response of T cells to the epithelial microenvironment, and more particularly, an increase activation of a pro-inflammatory CD8+ T cells effector population in CD patients compared to controls.

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

        <tr id="The persistence of adoptively transferred T cells is vital for anti-tumor efficacy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can persist indefinitely when delivered to patients with B cell cancers and can confer long-term remission. For patients with solid tumors, however, sustaining CAR T cell activity remains a major challenge. This has been attributed in part to the immune microenvironment within solid tumors, though the contribution of specific immune subsets to resistance to CAR T cells is not clear. Here we resolve how the immunology of irradiated tumors dramatically enhances persistence and efficacy of CAR T cells targeted to advanced lung metastases in a syngeneic mouse model. Remarkably, CAR T cell persistence depended critically on dendritic cells (DC) that underwent trogocytic “antigen-dressing” of tumor target antigens and stimulated CAR T cells through the chimeric receptor. Furthermore, tumor irradiation increased antigen-dressing onto DCs. In the absence of functional DCs, CAR T cell activity in irradiated tumor was short-lived and tumors relapsed. These findings establish a critical mechanism through which DCs maintain the CAR T cell pool in irradiated tumors, thus supporting translation of this approach to advance CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Reducing calorie intake without malnutrition limits tumor progression but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that dietary restriction (DR) suppresses tumor growth by enhancing CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. DR reshapes CD8+ T cell differentiation within the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the development of effector T cell subsets while limiting the accumulation of exhausted T (Tex) cells, and synergizes with anti-PD1 immunotherapy to restrict tumor growth. Mechanistically, DR enhances CD8+ T cell metabolic fitness through increased ketone body oxidation (ketolysis), which boosts mitochondrial membrane potential and fuels tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-dependent pathways essential for T cell function. T cells deficient for ketolysis exhibit reduced mitochondrial function, increased exhaustion, and fail to control tumor growth under DR conditions. Our findings reveal a critical role for the immune system in mediating the anti-tumor effects of DR, highlighting nutritional modulation of CD8+ T cell fate in the TME as a critical determinant of anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Keloids, characterized by excessive scar tissue resulting from abnormal wound healing, are primarily driven by hyperproliferative fibroblasts and overproduction of extracellular matrix. Although human natural killer (NK) cells are known for their role in inhibiting uncontrolled cell growth through cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α, they also produce amphiregulin (AREG), which paradoxically promotes cell proliferation and survival. The involvement of NK cells in keloid pathogenesis, however, remains largely unexplored. This study uncovers remarkable functional changes in NK cells within both lesional skin and the blood of keloid patients. In the skin, NK cell-produced IFN-γ plays a pivotal role in limiting keloid progression by inducing fibroblast apoptosis and curbing excessive extracellular matrix production, while NK cell-derived AREG actively opposes these protective effects. Notably, TGF-β-driven fibroblasts in keloid lesions further dampen NK cell IFN-γ production, revealing a complex and dynamic cellular interplay. In the bloodstream of keloid patients, a distinct NK cell subset emerges, marked by elevated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and diminished IFN-γ production, which correlates with increased plasma IFN-β levels. This elevated IFN-β serves as a key initiating factor, driving NK cell exhaustion through impaired mitochondrial function and metabolic disruption. These findings highlight a critical mechanism underlying the functional abnormalities of keloid-associated NK cells and emphasize the influence of both local and systemic factors in shaping NK cell responses in keloid pathogenesis. Graphical abstract Highlights In the skin, NK cell-derived IFN-γ is crucial for suppressing keloid fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix production. AREG from NK cells counteracts the inhibitory effects of IFN-γ on keloid progression. In the blood, elevated IFN-β in keloid patients drives the emergence of ISG+NK cells with reduced IFN-γ production. IFN-β induces mitochondrial dysfunction and functional exhaustion in NK cells.">

However, how different types of chronic antigenic exposures impact T cell differentiation and function remains incompletely understood. Using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) as models for persistent stimulation in autoimmunity and chronic viral infection, we performed high-dimensional mass cytometry analyses to examine their effects on CD4+ T cell differentiation. We found that CMV seropositive adults have a significant population of highly differentiated CD27-CD28-CD4+ T cells that exhibited common features of senescence, including CD57 and cytotoxic granule expression. In contrast, CD27-CD28-CD4+ T cells were rare in RA patients and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or Herpes simplex virus (HSV) seropositive individuals. The few that were present exhibited a predominantly non-cytotoxic profile, with higher expression of TCF1, CD127, and Ki67. Among CMV seropositive individuals, RA was associated with reduced degranulation of cytotoxic granules and lower cytokine production by senescent CD4+ T cells. We did not find an association with age, sex, clinical characteristics, or medication usage by univariate linear regression analyses. However, in vitro tofacitinib treatment reduced T cell functional activity, suggesting contributions from both the disease and RA treatment.

        <tr id="Lymph nodes (LNs) are secondary lymphoid organs where lymphocytes interact with antigen presenting cells to initiate adaptive immune responses within microenvironments established by resident stromal cells. LNs are also the major site of growth of follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), B cell neoplasms that alter the stromal architecture of LNs in highly stereotypic ways. To characterize FL and CLL cells within the LN microenvironment, we developed a pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing of all resident LN cells. We observed that proliferation of FL and CLL cells within specialized niches commences with transient upregulation of MYC, subsequent downregulation of which may act to limit the growth potential of these indolent neoplasms. Proliferating FL cells within neoplastic follicles co-localized with follicular dendritic cells, whereas proliferating CLL cells were spatially associated with a distinct set of fibroblasts expressing CCL19 that localized to proliferation centers. We used informatic analyses and microscopy to identify and validate interacting sets of ligand-receptor pairs between proliferating neoplastic B cells, immune cells and stromal fibroblasts, including interactions involving CD74-MIF, TNFRSF13C (BAFF receptor), immunomodulatory factors such as CD55 and Galectin-9 (Gal9), and adhesion molecules. Our analyses highlight common features of these two microenvironment-dependent neoplasms and provide a roadmap for identifying vulnerabilities and new therapeutic strategies. Key points Nodal FL and CLL cells have similar proliferative programs and predicted ligand-receptor interactions with immune and stromal cells. Proliferation of FL and CLL cells occurs in distinct lymph node niches defined by different types of fibroblasts.">

 Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are critical for initiating and sustaining tumor-reactive CD8 T cells; lack of functional cDC1s is a key driver for failed tumor immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. However, what factors cause the cDC1 insufficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. Commensal microbiota has emerged as a key regulator of TME and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Nonetheless, most studies have focused on the intestinal microbiome; it remains underexplored whether and how the local microbiota within tumors influences the anti-cancer immunity. Using the autochthonous Kras LSL-G12D/+ ; p53 flox/flox (KP) mouse model of lung cancer, we found an increased local bacterial burden and altered bacterial composition associated with lung tumors. Importantly, this local microbiota suppresses the anti-tumor CD8 T cell response both at baseline and in response to ICB therapies. Specifically, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that the microbiota shapes the functional subsets of tumor-reactive CD8 T cells. Bacterial depletion promotes the accumulation of stem-like Tpex cells (precursor of exhausted T cells) in the TME, which serve as a reservoir of effector CD8 T cells and mediate an effective response upon ICB treatment. To distinguish the function of the local microbiota within TME from the distal gut microbiota, we developed a new method of aerosolized antibiotic treatment, which selectively ablates the intra-tumoral lung microbiota while preserving the intact gut microbiota. Using this approach, we demonstrated that removal of the intra-tumoral lung microbiota markedly improves the tumor-reactive T cell response and sensitizing “cold” lung tumors to ICB therapies. Mechanistically, we identified cDC1s as a central player in microbiota-mediated suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Local microbiota diminishes cDC1 quality and quantity in the lung TME, resulting in impaired T cell priming and Tpex maintenance. At the molecular level, our data revealed that bacterial products derived from the local microbiota induce type I interferon expression in tumor-associated myeloid cells and enhance GM-CSF production from cancer cells: chronic type I interferon and GM-CSF signaling acts cooperatively to reduce the functional cDC1 population. Combining in vitro cDC1 assays, competitive bone marrow chimera experiments and cDC1-specific knockout models, we establish the causal relationships between the local microbiota, IFN-I and GM-CSF signaling in cDC1s, and the tumor response to ICB. Altogether, our study uncovered a dominant role of tumor-associated microbiota in inhibiting cDC1s and suppressing anti-tumor immunity through type I IFN and GM-CSF dependent pathways in lung cancer. Our findings not only identify the intra-tumoral microbiota as a critical therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment, but also provide new insights into the tissue-specific, context-dependent regulatory mechanisms of cDC1s in the TME.

        <tr id="The intricate immunological functions of human skin involve the interplay between multiple different cell types as well as dynamic trafficking of leukocytes in and out the tissue, both of which are extremely challenging to replicate in vitro. To enable in vitro investigation of human skin immunology, we developed a microfluidic human skin equivalent (HSE) that supports the delivery of circulating immune cells via a vascular microchannel embedded within the dermis of a full-thickness construct. We demonstrated that stimulation of keratinocyte inflammation with lipopolysaccharide and nigericin promoted rapid monocyte recruitment out of the vascular channel and into the epidermal layer within 24 hours, followed by a second wave of monocyte migration into the dermis over a period of six days. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the tissue-resident and recruited cell populations revealed dynamic and cell-specific patterns of gene expression that were characteristic of acute activation and resolution of an inflammatory immune response. Moreover, comparison of the gene signatures of the monocyte-derived cells to in vivo populations provided molecular level validation of the model and indicated a differentiation trajectory of the monocytes through to mature dermal macrophages. To extend the microfluidic platform to additional applications, we also modelled age-associated immune dysfunction by the inclusion of senescent fibroblasts, which promoted increased monocyte recruitment into the HSE, replicating previous in vivo human studies. Thus, the microfluidic HSE presented here replicates key aspects of dynamic inflammatory immune responses within the skin and represents a tractable experimental tool for interrogating mechanisms of human skin immunology.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, particularly in combating viral infections and malignancies. CD8 T cells, derived from bone marrow progenitors and matured in the thymus, play an essential role in immune defense through their cytotoxic activity. These cells are distinguished by their ability to recognize and eliminate cells that present specific antigens via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Upon activation by antigen recognition, they proliferate and differentiate into effector cells capable of eliminating infected or abnormal cells.CD8+ T cells develop in the thymus and express the CD8 co-receptor, which interacts specifically with MHC class I molecules. When a naïve CD8+ T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC) displaying an antigen bound to MHC class I, it undergoes activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells. The primary function of these cells is to eliminate infected or malignant cells by inducing apoptosis through the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes or by engaging death receptors on target cells. Over the past few decades, CD8+ T cells have garnered significant attention for their potential in immunotherapy, particularly in cancer treatment. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of CD8+ T cells in immunotherapy, their mechanisms of action, and the challenges associated with harnessing their full potential.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Rich cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in cancerous tissues is associated with better clinical prognosis. A major obstacle to tumor T cell infiltration can be the scarcity of adhesion molecules expressed by the growing tumor neo-vasculature that limits the binding and extravasation of effector lymphocytes. In the present study, we aimed at reversing this endothelial cell anergy in vitro by using bispecific antibodies that redirect T cells to endothelial cell growth factor receptors and mediate T cell activation via CD3 and costimulation via CD28 in direct contact with endothelial cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of T cells and endothelial cells resulted in a profound upregulation of adhesion molecules due to the secretion of proinflammatory T cell cytokines. T-cell adhesion to previously quiescent endothelial cells, as well as their capacity to migrate through an endothelial cell monolayer and subsequently kill breast cancer cell spheroids, was greatly augmented.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is often associated with metastasis and recurrence and is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In the progression of CRC, recent studies have highlighted the critical role of neutrophils, particularly tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs). TANs have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing activities, contributing to metastasis, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Tumor-promoting TANs promote tumor growth by releasing proteases, reactive oxygen species, and cytokines, whereas tumor-suppressing TANs enhance immune responses by activating T cells and natural killer cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying TAN mobilization, plasticity, and their role in the tumor microenvironment has revealed potential therapeutic targets. This review provides a comprehensive overview of TAN biology in CRC and discusses both the tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing functions of neutrophils. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting TANs, such as chemokine receptor antagonists, aim to modulate neutrophil reprogramming and offer promising avenues for improving treatment outcomes of CRC.">

        <tr id="Introduction Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a predominant subset of innate-like T cells in humans, characterized by diverse gene expression profiles and functional capabilities. However, the factors influencing the transcriptomes and effector functions of MAIT cells, particularly at mucosal barriers, remain largely unclear. Methods In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional assays to investigate the transcriptomic and functional characteristics of intestinal MAIT cells in mouse models during aging. We also extended scRNA-seq analysis to human intestinal MAIT cells to compare their gene expression patterns with those observed in aged mice. Results Our findings demonstrated that the transcriptomes and functional capabilities of intestinal MAIT cells shifted from MAIT17 to MAIT1 profiles with aging in mouse models, with notable changes in the production of cytotoxic molecules. Further scRNA-seq analysis of human intestinal MAIT cells revealed a segregation into MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets, displaying gene expression patterns that mirrored those seen in aged mouse models. The transcription factor RORγt was expressed in both MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, acting to repress IFNγ production while promoting IL17 expression. Moreover, reduced expression of RORC and Il17A was correlated with poorer survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. Discussion These results suggest that aging induces a functional shift between MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, which may be influenced by transcriptional regulators like RORγt. The observed alterations in MAIT cell activity could potentially impact disease prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of MAIT cell responses at mucosal barriers, highlighting possible therapeutic targets for modulating MAIT cell functions in aging and disease.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are specialized lymphocytes that help protect against viruses and cancer. However, in the context of bacterial infections, NK cells can be harmful, rather than protective. Such immune pathogenesis by NK cells has been linked to the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In this context, IFN-γ-deficient mice display increased survival rates in response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which causes life-threatening, invasive systemic infections with high mortality rates in humans. However, little is known about how NK cells respond to S. aureus in humans. In this study, we found that the peripheral blood of patients with bloodstream S. aureus infection was enriched for NKG2A+ NK cells with greater cytokine producing capacity, compared to those hospitalized with Escherichia coli bloodstream infections. As a possible mechanistic cause, superantigens from S. aureus promoted the expansion of CD57− NKG2A+ NK cells which produced IFN-γ through an IL-12-independent mechanism and exhibited reduced levels of CD16 compared to unstimulated NK cells. These data suggest that S. aureus bloodstream infection in humans promotes a phenotypic shift towards NKG2A+ NK cells with greater IFN-γ producing capacity, providing a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis. AUTHOR SUMMARY Natural Killer (NK) cells are specialized immune cells that provide crucial defence against viruses but can also respond to bacterial infections, especially in humans. During bloodstream infection by Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans, NK cells may actually be harmful, rather than protective, to the host. However, very little is known about the NK cell response to invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections in humans. Here, we show that human patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli, infections have an increased frequency of NK cells with increased pro-inflammatory capacity. Furthermore, we show that toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which help the bacteria evade the protective effects of T cells the immune system (“superantigens”), promoted the expansion of these pro-inflammatory NK cells, providing a possible mechanistic cause for their increased presence in patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus infections. Collectively, these results suggest that Staphylococcus aureus infection triggers phenotypic and functional changes in NK cells that provide a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis">

Recent advancements, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells and cytokine-based stimulation, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects compared to conventional immunotherapies. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a significant obstacle, imposing challenges like immune checkpoint activation, cytokine suppression, and metabolic constraints that impair NK cell activity.

We made a novel conditional CD206 (Mrc1) knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete CD206+ TAMs. Early depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (Mono/Macs) led to the indirect loss of conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1), CD8 T cells, and NK cells in tumors. CD206+ TAMs robustly expressed CXCL9, contrasting with stress-responsive Spp1-expressing TAMs and immature monocytes, which became prominent with early depletion. CD206+ TAMs differentially attracted activated CD8 T cells, and the NK and CD8 T cells in CD206-depleted tumors were deficient in Cxcr3 and cDC1-supportive Xcl1 and Flt3l expressions. Disrupting this key antitumor axis decreased tumor control by antigen-specific T cells in mice. In human cancers, a CD206Replete, but not a CD206Depleted Mono/Mac gene signature correlated robustly with CD8 T cell, cDC1, and NK signatures and was associated with better survival.

We identified LOC730338, an elncRNA associated with A-to-I RNA editing, which we renamed ADARreg. Silencing ADARreg re-sensitized tumor cells to BCR pathway inhibition by modulating ADAR2 nuclear translocation and altering intronic RNA editing. The process preferentially affected genes that enhance immune responses, such as STING, IRF3, and p65. ADARreg knockdown also increased lymphoma cell sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

        <tr id="Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurs in one of five patients. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the virulence factor TcdB reduce disease recurrence, suggesting that an inadequate anti-TcdB response to CDI leads to recurrence. In patients with CDI, we discovered that IL-33 measured at diagnosis predicts future recurrence, leading us to test the role of IL-33 signaling in the induction of humoral immunity during CDI. Using a mouse recurrence model, IL-33 was demonstrated to be integral for anti-TcdB antibody production. IL-33 acted via ST2+ ILC2 cells, facilitating germinal center T follicular helper (GC-Tfh) cell generation of antibodies. IL-33 protection from reinfection was antibody-dependent, as μMT KO mice and mice treated with anti-CD20 mAb were not protected. These findings demonstrate the critical role of IL-33 in generating humoral immunity to prevent recurrent CDI. Graphical Abstract: IL-33 restoration induces toxin-B-specific antibody production via the ILC2-TFH axis. In the left panel, IL-33 remediation increases ILC2s, subsequently inducing TFH directly or indirectly. TFH cell induction is pivotal for the production of antibodies. IL-33 also downregulates type 1 and type 3 immunity, favoring type 2 immunity to enhance host survival and reduce morbidity. The middle panel illustrates antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, resulting in decreased IL-33 levels and reduced antibody production. The right panel demonstrates the protective effect in reinfection, attributed to toxin-specific antibodie generated by IL-33 remediation.">

        <tr id="Introduction CAR-T cell therapy is associated with life-threatening inflammatory toxicities, partly due to the activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines by bystander myeloid cells (BMCs). However, due to limited clinical data, it is unclear whether CAR-NK cells cause similar toxicities. Methods We characterized the soluble factors (SFs) released by activated human CAR-T and CAR-NK cells and assessed their role in BMC activation (BMCA). Results We found that SFs from both activated, peripheral blood-derived CAR-T (PB-CAR-T) and CAR-NK (PB-CAR-NK) cells induced BMCA; however, PB-CAR-NK cells caused significantly lower BMCA compared to PB-CAR-T cells. Interestingly, SFs from cord-blood-derived (CB) NK cells caused little to no BMCA, consistent with previous clinical studies showing minimal inflammatory toxicity with CB-CAR-NK cells. Comparative analysis of SFs released by PB-NK and PB-CAR-NK cells following CAR-dependent and CAR-independent activation revealed several candidate factors with the potential to cause BMCA. Antibody-mediated neutralization studies identified a combination of four factors that contribute to PB-CAR-NK cell-mediated BMCA. siRNA-mediated knockdown studies confirmed that inactivating these four factors in PB-CAR-NK cells significantly reduces BMCA. Importantly, neutralization or knockdown of these four factors did not affect CAR-NK cell potency. Discussion These data suggest that specific SFs released by PB-CAR-NK cells activate BMCs and have the potential to contribute to inflammatory toxicities. Furthermore, inactivation of these four factors in PB-CAR-NK cells could reduce inflammatory toxicities and improve safety of PB-CAR-NK cell therapy without compromising potency.">

        <tr id="The lack of persistence and short-term efficacy presents a major challenge for CAR-NK cell therapy. Here, we addressed this issue by developing pluripotent stem cell-derived NK lineage-committed progenitor (iNKP) cell therapy. For the first time, we generated abundant iNKP cells via an organoid culture system. The iNKP cells, engineered to express CXCR4 and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), efficiently migrated to the bone marrow and generated CAR-iNK cells persisting in peripheral blood (PB) for over 80 days. Notably, CAR-iNKP cell therapy durably protected animals from tumour occurrence. Furthermore, a single low-dose infusion of CAR-iNKP cells following conventional chemotherapy eradicated minimal residual disease (MRD), leading to long-term complete remission. Our findings present a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of traditional CAR-NK cell therapy and offer dural breakthroughs for the prevention of tumour occurrence and relapse.">

Mounting evidence indicates that T cell senescence constitutes the primary mechanism underlying T cell dysfunction in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents one of the potential causes of immunotherapy failure. AML usually progresses rapidly and is highly susceptible to drug resistance, thereby resulting in recurrence and patient mortality. Hence, disrupting the immune interface within the bone marrow microenvironment of AML has emerged as a critical objective for synergistically enhancing tumor immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the general characteristics, distinctive phenotypes, and regulatory signaling networks of senescent T cells and highlight their potential clinical significance in the bone marrow microenvironment of AML. Additionally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for alleviating and reversing T cell senescence.">

        <tr id="Tumors can exert a far-reaching influence on the body, triggering systemic responses that contribute to debilitating conditions like cancer cachexia. To characterize the mechanisms underlying tumor-host interactions, we utilized a BioID-based proximity labeling method to identify proteins secreted by Ykiact adult Drosophila gut tumors into the bloodstream/hemolymph. Among the major proteins identified are coagulation and immune-responsive factors that contribute to the systemic wasting phenotypes associated with Ykiact tumors. The effect of innate immunity factors is mediated by NFκB transcription factors Relish, dorsal, and Dif, which in turn upregulate the expression of the cachectic factors Pvf1, Impl2, and Upd3. In addition, Ykiact tumors secrete Eiger, a TNF-alpha homolog, which activates the JNK signaling pathway in neighboring non-tumor cells, leading to cell death. The release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from these dying cells presumably amplifies the inflammatory response, exacerbating systemic wasting. Targeting the inflammatory response, the JNK pathway, or the production of cachectic factors could potentially alleviate the debilitating effects of cancer cachexia.">

        <tr id="Peripherally-derived regulatory T cells (pTregs) have a prominent role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. In cases of phosphoinositide-3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) inactivation, such as in patients receiving PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib as a cancer treatment, breakdown of intestinal immune tolerance occurs frequently in the form of diarrhoea and colon inflammation. In a mouse model of systemic PI3Kδ inactivation, both enhancement of anti-tumor immunity and colitis have been described, as a result of Treg impairment. However, in view of the critical role for Tregs in the prevention of systemic autoimmunity, the basis for such tissue-restricted breach of immune tolerance upon loss of PI3Kδ function is not yet understood. We report here that mice lacking PI3Kδ activity do not suffer a general defect in Treg immunosuppression, but specifically fail to develop Helios- pTregs in the colon. We demonstrate reduced extrathymic Treg induction, in vitro and in vivo, from naïve CD4+ T cells with inactive PI3Kδ, along with dysregulation of a tissue-resident phenotype. These results suggest a non-redundant role for PI3Kδ-dependent pTreg differentiation in maintaining tolerance to commensal microbial antigens in the gut.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is highly enriched with tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). However, effective therapeutic agents targeting tumor-associated myeloid cells in HNSCC are currently lacking. Here, we employed a unique co-culture system to investigate how HNSCC cells affect tumor-associated myeloid cells. We found that the presence of cancer cells significantly enhances myeloid cell proliferation and promotes TAM differentiation. To identify potential therapeutic agents, we screened a custom library of 70 kinase inhibitors to assess their effects on distinct subsets of tumor-associated myeloid cells. We discovered specific inhibitors that differentially suppressed the populations of TAMs, monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), or polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), suggesting that inhibiting different targets could reduce distinct subsets of tumor-associated myeloid cells. Conversely, some inhibitors were found to increase the population of CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6C− myeloid cells. Among the promising inhibitors tested, vatalanib, a VEGF-R inhibitor, demonstrated significant in vivo efficacy at inhibiting tumor growth and reducing tumor-associated myeloid cells, thereby underscoring its potential as a therapeutic agent. Our findings highlight specific kinase inhibitors with differential modulatory effects on HNSCC-associated myeloid subsets and caution the application of some as anti-cancer drugs. This experimental system may provide a robust platform for identifying new agents targeting tumor-associated myeloid cells in HNSCC and beyond, and for elucidating mechanistic insights into tumor-myeloid cell interaction.">

        <tr id="Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature, immune suppressive myeloid cells. However, their role in periodontal disease (PD), a microbially induced inflammatory oral disease, remains understudied. Here we show that gingiva (gums) from PD patients exhibit significantly higher levels of MDSC markers including Granulocytic (G)-MDSC and Monocytic (M)-MDSC subsets as well as CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells. Gingival MDSC subsets exhibit potent immunoregulatory activity as marked by attenuated autologous CD4+ T cells proliferation and IFNγ production. In a murine model of ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP), we noticed time-dependent gingival MDSC infiltration, which correlates with CD4+ T cell and CD19+ B cell infiltration. To test whether MDSC confer immunoregulatory function in vivo, we adoptively transferred G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in mice. Interestingly, we observed significant reduction in inflammatory marker expression (IL6, TNF-α, and IL-1β), infiltration of CD4+ T cells, and concomitant increase in MDSC-derived immune suppressive molecules, ARG1 and IL-10, and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs compared to mock. Conversely, depletion of MDSC using anti-Gr1 antibody resulted in marked induction of periodontal inflammation, reduced Treg population, and significantly higher alveolar bone loss. These findings, for the first time, suggest an anti-inflammatory and osteoprotective function of MDSCs in PD and offer a promising target to treat unresolved periodontal inflammation.">

Here, we show that multiple stages of iPD, including the pre-motor prodromal stage, can be stratified according to the inflammatory and immunometabolic responses to stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo. We identified increased stimulation-dependent secretion of TNF, IL-1β, and IL-8 in monocytes from RBD patients and showed diminished proinflammatory cytokine secretion in monocytes and T cells in early and moderate stages of PD. Mechanistically, immune activation revealed deficits in CD8+ T-cell mitochondrial health in moderate PD, and relative mitochondrial health in CD8+ T cells was positively correlated with stimulation-dependent T-cell cytokine secretion across the PD spectrum. Dysregulated immunometabolism may drive peripheral inflammation and PD progression, and ex vivo stimulation-based assays have potential to reveal novel biomarkers for patient stratification and progression with immune endophenotypes.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8 + T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8 + T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, we found that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the same apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell-intrinsic signaling pathways can drastically affect the tumor immune microenvironment, promoting tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy by excluding immune-cell populations from the tumor. Several tumor cell-intrinsic pathways have been reported to modulate myeloid-cell and T-cell infiltration creating "cold" tumors. However, clinical evidence suggests that excluding cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core also mediates immune evasion. Here, we find that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 signaling in non-small cell lung cancer induces the exclusion of cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core and promotes resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. Mechanistically, tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression upregulates CCL2 in tumor cells, resulting in increased recruitment of regulatory T cells. CD8+ T-cell exclusion depended on regulatory T cell-mediated suppression of tumor vasculature. Depleting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells via Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related protein (GITR) restored CD8+ T-cell infiltration and, when combined with checkpoint blockade therapy, reduced tumor growth. These results show that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression in lung cancer serves as a mechanism of immunotherapy resistance and provide evidence to support future studies investigating whether NSCLC patients with SOX2-dependent CD8+ T-cell exclusion would benefit from the depletion of GITR+ Tregs.">

        <tr id="Primary and secondary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reduces its efficacy. The mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance are highly complex. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these mechanisms are primarily associated with the loss of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic mutations, circular RNA axis and transcription factor regulation, antigen presentation disorders, and dysregulation of signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a pivotal role in driving immunotherapy resistance. Primary resistance is mainly attributed to TME alterations, including mutations and co-mutations, modulation of T cell infiltration, enrichment of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pulmonary fibrosis. Acquired resistance mainly stems from changes in cellular infiltration patterns leading to “cold” or “hot” tumors, altered interferon (IFN) signaling pathway expression, involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and oxidative stress responses, as well as post-treatment gene mutations and circadian rhythm disruption (CRD). This review presents an overview of various mechanisms underlying resistance to ICB, elucidates the alterations in the TME during primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance, and discusses existing strategies for overcoming ICB resistance.">

Progression and therapy response are influenced by this immune environment, highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of endogenous immune responses to malignant plasma cells. Here we used the 5TGM1 murine transfer model of multiple myeloma to dissect early immune responses to myeloma cells. We modeled stable and progressive disease by transferring 5TGM1 murine myeloma cells into C57Bl/6 mice and KaLwRij mice, respectively. We used flow cytometry and single‐cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses to characterize differential immune responses in stable and progressive disease. Transfer of 5TGM1 cells in C57Bl/6 mice led to stable disease with low tumor burden in a subset of animals. Stable disease was associated with sustained activation and expansion of NK cells, ILC1, and CD8+ T cells, a response that was lost upon disease progression. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing of immune cells and bulk RNA sequencing of immune and mesenchymal stromal cells implicated the activation of interferon responses as a central immune pathway during stable disease. Experimentally, neutralization of IFNγ significantly increased myeloma development and progression in C57Bl/6 mice, testifying to the importance of this pathway in early disease control. In conclusion, we provide a framework for studying immune responses to multiple myeloma progression in immunocompetent and genetically modifiable mice and highlight the importance of bone marrow immunity in tumor control.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by unlimited accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides. It is often accompanied by disease, and the relationship between ferroptosis of immune cells and immune regulation has been attracting increasing attention. Initially, it was found in cancer research that the inhibition of regulatory T cell (Treg) ferroptosis and the promotion of CD8+ T cell ferroptosis jointly promoted the formation of an immune-tolerant environment in tumors. T-cell ferroptosis has subsequently been found to have immunoregulatory effects in other diseases. As an autoimmune disease characterized by immune imbalance, T-cell ferroptosis has attracted attention for its potential in regulating immune balance in lupus nephritis. This article reviews the metabolic processes within different T-cell subsets in lupus nephritis (LN), including T follicular helper (TFH) cells, T helper (Th)17 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Treg cells, and reveals that these cellular metabolisms not only facilitate the formation of a T-cell immune imbalance but are also closely associated with the occurrence of ferroptosis. Consequently, we hypothesize that targeting the metabolic pathways of ferroptosis could become a novel research direction for effectively treating the immune imbalance in lupus nephritis by altering T-cell differentiation and the incidence of ferroptosis.">

It is a highly plastic process that secures the response to external and internal stimuli to face acute and changing needs. Infections and chronic diseases including cancer can modulate it by producing several factors, impacting proliferation and differentiation programs. While the lymphocytic compartment has attracted major attention due to the role of adaptive immunity in anticancer immune response, in recent years, research has found convincing evidence that confirms the importance of innate immunity and the key function played by emergency myelopoiesis. Due to cancer’s ability to manipulate myelopoiesis to its own advantage, the purpose of this review is to outline myelopoiesis processes within the tumor microenvironment and suggest possible therapeutic lines of research to restore the physiological functioning of the host’s immune system, with a special outlook on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).">

        <tr id="During chronic infection or tumorigenesis, persistent antigen stimulation contributes to the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, exhausted CD8+ T (TEX) cells still preserve certain effector function, and maintaining a reservoir of exhausted cells is of vital importance for virus elimination and tumor eradiation. Despite considerable work interrogating the rejuvenation of TEX cells, mechanisms underpinning the clonal deletion of TEX cells remain largely unexplored over the past decade. In this study, we employed mouse models of LCMV infection to demonstrate that excessive accumulation of lipid peroxidation rendered virus-specific TEX cells to ferroptosis, which may correlate with enhanced mitochondria-derived oxidative stress and compromised activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). In addition, either incomplete or complete ablation of GPX4 resulted in exacerbated ferroptosis and aggravated shrunken population of virus-specific TEX cells. On the other hand, inhibiting ferroptosis via administration of a ferroptosis inhibitor or overexpression of GPX4 greatly rectified the cell loss of virus-specific TEX cells. Collectively, we disclosed ferroptosis as a crucial player in the clonal deletion of virus-specific TEX cells and stressed the intervention of ferroptosis as a promising approach to optimize the longevity of virus-specific TEX cells.">

        <tr id="Background Although MDSCs are widely recognized for their immunoinhibitory effects in pathological conditions, their function during HIV infection particularly within the mechanisms underlying incomplete immune recovery remains elusive. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 30 healthy controls and 62 HIV-1-infected subjects [31 immunological non-responders (INRs) and 31 immunological responders (IRs)] were selected. The proportion of MDSCs was determined in each category of participants. Using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, immune regulatory molecules (including PD-L1, ARG1, iNOS, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO) that are relevant for MDSCs activity were quantified. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the blockade of PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways on MDSCs and their effects on CD4+ T-cells using in vitro functional experiments. Results PMN-MDSCs are more abundant and are negatively correlated to CD4 counts in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, PMN-MDSCs suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in INRs. Furthermore, correlations were found between PD-L1 expression on PMN-MDSCs and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells. TGF-β expression on PMN-MDSCs was likewise enhanced in INRs. Importantly, inhibiting both PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways had a synergistic impact on restoring CD4+ T-cell activity in vitro. Conclusions PMN-MDSCs expansion inhibits CD4+ T-cell responses. We suggest that targeting PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways together may significantly improve immune recovery in INRs.">

        <tr id="Background: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted T cell-redirecting immunotherapies, including Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and T-cell engagers have demonstrated remarkable success in treating relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells. However, a significant challenge is the severe side effects associated with T-cell overactivation, leading to cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity in MM patients undergoing such therapies. Bispecific NK cell engagers (NKCEs) may offer a promising alternative by redirecting NK cell cytotoxic activity towards tumor cells without triggering cytokine release syndrome. Methods: In this study, we designed a series of BCMA × CD16 NKCEs that simultaneously engage BCMA and CD16 on MM and NK cells, respectively. We evaluated the functionality of these NKCEs in vitro with respect to their molecular design. Results: Our results indicate that the format design of NKCEs influences their functionalities, underscoring the importance of format selection in optimizing NKCE-based therapies for MM. This study provides valuable insights for developing next-generation NKCEs and advancing therapeutic strategies for MM and potentially other malignancies.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play an integral role in immunosurveillance against myeloid malignancies, with their mature phenotype and abundance linked to prolonged treatment-free remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, NK cell function is suppressed during the disease, and the orchestrators of this impairment are not fully understood. Using a chimeric BCR::ABL1+ CML mouse model, we characterized the impact of the leukemic microenvironment on NK cell function. We showed that NK cells have reduced counts, immature phenotype, poor cytotoxicity, and altered expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in CML mice, which revert to a steady state upon BCR::ABL1 inhibition. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an inflammatory cytokine response in CML-exposed NK cells, highlighted by the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa)-induced gene signature, upregulation of TNFa receptor TNFR2, and enrichment of SOCS family genes such as Cish, the critical NK cell checkpoint. Ex vivo exposure of healthy NK cells to leukemic soluble factors compromised target-specific NK cell degranulation, which was partially rescued by targeting Cish or TNFa. In alignment with these findings, NK cells from healthy donors displayed suppressed cytotoxicity when exposed to plasma from untreated CML patients, with a partial restoration upon Cish or TNFa inhibition. Furthermore, NK cells from newly diagnosed CML patients pre-destined for blast crisis showed an enrichment of the TNFa-induced pro-inflammatory gene signature identified in CML mice. These results suggest that targeting inflammatory signaling could enhance NK cell-based immunotherapies for CML.">

        <tr id="The increasing use of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade has led to the emergence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including dysfunction of the submandibular gland (SMG). In this study, we investigated the immunoregulatory mechanism contributing to the susceptibility of the SMG to irAEs. We found that the SMGs of PD-1-deficient mice and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-treated mice harbor an expanded population of CD8+ T cells. We demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells expressing PD-L1 tightly regulate CD8+ T cells in the SMG. When this immunoregulation is disrupted, CD8+ T cells clonally expand and acquire a unique transcriptional profile consistent with T cell receptor (TCR) activation. These clonally expanded cells phenotypically overlapped with cytotoxic GzmK+ CD8+ T autoimmune cells identified in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Understanding how NK cells modulate CD8+ T cell activity in the SMG opens new avenues for preventing irAEs in patients undergoing checkpoint blockade therapies.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is characterized by a concomitant early pro-inflammatory response by immune cells to an infection, and an opposing anti-inflammatory response that results in protracted immunosuppression. The primary pathological event in sepsis is widespread programmed cell death, or cellular self-sacrifice, of innate and adaptive immune cells, leading to profound immunological suppression. This severe immune dysfunction hampers effective primary pathogen clearance, thereby increasing the risk of secondary opportunistic infections, latent viral reactivation, multiple organ dysfunction, and elevated mortality. The types of cell death include apoptosis (type I programmed cell death), autophagy (type II programmed cell death), NETosis (a program for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)) and other programmed cell deaths like pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, each contributing to immunosuppression in distinct ways during the later phases of sepsis. Extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, such as CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, is strongly associated with immunosuppression. Apoptosis of dendritic cells further compromises T and B cell survival and can induce T cell anergy or promote regulatory Treg cell proliferation. Moreover, delayed apoptosis and impaired neutrophil function contribute to nosocomial infections and immune dysfunction in sepsis. Interestingly, aberrant NETosis and the subsequent depletion of mature neutrophils also trigger immunosuppression, and neutrophil pyroptosis can positively regulate NETosis. The interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) plays a key role in T cell modulation and neutrophil apoptosis in sepsis. The dendritic cell growth factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLTEL), increases DC numbers, enhances CD 28 expression, attenuates PD-L1, and improves survival in sepsis. Recently, immunoadjuvant therapies have attracted attention for their potential to restore host physiological immunity and homeostasis in patients with sepsis. This review focuses on several potential immunotherapeutic agents designed to bolster suppressed innate and adaptive immune responses in the management of sepsis.">

 Effector B cell responses in solid malignancies are associated with favorable response to immunotherapy. B cells can amplify anti-tumor immune responses via antibody production, antigen presentation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release; yet B cells in cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice often fail to support these functions. We have evaluated the contribution of either systemic inflammatory cues or antigenic quality to B cell differentiation and function in cancer. First, we identify dysregulated transcriptional programs activated in pancreatic cancer-associated B cells that promote differentiation of naïve into immunosuppressive B cells and inhibit differentiation of anti-tumor plasma cells. Second, we find that systemic exposure to STING agonists potentiates expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory human and mouse IL35+ B lymphocytes. Finally, using a system where a B cell neoantigen is either soluble or tethered to the surface of cancer cells, we demonstrate that membrane-tethered antigen is sufficient to elicit activation of anti-tumor immunity and reduce tumor growth in a NK cell-dependent manner. Thus, inflammation and quality of antigen impact basic mechanisms governing B cell differentiation and the resulting immune response to solid malignancy with implications for vaccine engineering.

        <tr id="Dysregulated metabolism in tumor tissues, and para-tumor tissues alike, can lead to immunosuppression, which may underlie cancer development. However, metabolic intervention as a therapeutic strategy has been of no avail. In this study, we explored the anti-cancer therapeutic effect of aldometanib that specifically targets lysosome-associated aldolase to mimic glucose starvation and thereby activates the lysosomal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of metabolic homeostasis. We show that aldometanib inhibits the growth of HCC in an AMPK-dependent manner, allowing hepatoma-bearing mice to survive to mature ages, although aldometanib does not possess cytotoxicity towards HCC or normal cells. Intriguingly, aldometanib exerts anti-cancer effects only in immune-competent host mice, but not in immune-defective mice. We have further found that the HCC tissues in aldometanib-treated mice are massively infiltrated with CD8+ T cells, which is not seen in mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα. Our findings thus suggest that the metabolic regulator AMPK rebalances the tumor microenvironment to allow the cytotoxic immune cells inside the body to eliminate cancer cells and effectively contain the tumor tissues. The finding that metabolic intervention can make cancer a life-long manageable disease, may potentially usher in a new era of cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), is a crucial receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in various solid tumors, including lung, breast, and liver cancers. The concomitant expression of c-MET and PD-L1 in tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, highlights their prognostic significance and connection to therapeutic resistance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), activating c-MET signaling in tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). This activation leads to metabolic reprogramming and increased activity of enzymes like glutaminase (GLS), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and arginase 1 (ARG1), depleting essential amino acids in the tumor microenvironment that are vital for effector immune cell function. This review highlights the interplay between tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that create an immunosuppressive environment while providing targets for c-MET-focused immunotherapy. It emphasizes the clinical implications of c-MET inhibition on the behavior of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and NK cells. It explores the potential of c-MET antagonism combined with immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance cancer treatment paradigms. This review also discusses the innovative cancer immunotherapies targeting c-MET, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates, while encouraging the development of a comprehensive strategy that simultaneously tackles immune evasion and enhances anti-tumor efficacy further to improve the clinical prognoses for patients with c-MET-positive malignancies. Despite the challenges and variability in efficacy across different cancer subtypes, continued research into the molecular mechanisms and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies will be crucial.">

Here, we sought to define a comprehensive repertoire of cell surface antigens that can be targeted to stimulate macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphoma. We developed a high-throughput assay to screen hundreds of antibodies for their ability to provoke macrophages to attack B-cell lymphoma cells. Across both mouse and human systems, we identified multiple unappreciated targets of opsonization as well as putative immune checkpoints. We used this information to engineer a compendium of 156 bispecific antibodies, and we identified dozens of bispecifics that dramatically stimulate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity of lymphoma cells. Among these, a bispecific comprising a SIRPα decoy domain and a CD38-targeting arm (WTa2d1xCD38) exhibited maximal efficacy while minimizing the risk of hematologic toxicity. This bispecific stimulated robust anti-tumor responses in multiple xenograft models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Our approach can be directly applied to other cancers to rapidly discover bispecific antibodies that leverage anti-tumor responses by macrophages or other innate immune cells.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Immune checkpoints are essential for regulating excessive autoimmune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis. However, in the tumor microenvironment, these checkpoints can lead to cytotoxic T cell exhaustion, allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and promote tumor progression. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cancer cells is associated with poor prognoses, reduced survival rates, and lower responses to therapies. Consequently, downregulating PD-L1 expression has become a key strategy in developing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Caryophylli cortex (CC), derived from the bark of the clove tree Syzygium aromaticum, possesses antioxidant and cytotoxic properties against cancer cells, yet its potential as an ICI remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we aimed to investigate whether CC extract modulates PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and activates T cell immunity through a co-culture system of cancer cells and T cells, as well as in hPD-L1/MC-38 tumor-bearing animal models. Results: Our findings indicate that CC extract significantly downregulated both constitutive and inducible PD-L1 expression at non-toxic concentrations for cancer cells while simultaneously enhancing cancer cell mortality and T cell activity in the co-culture system. Furthermore, the administration of CC extract to hPD-L1/MC-38 tumor-bearing mice resulted in a greater than 70% reduction in tumor growth and increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Principal component analysis identified bergenin, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid as active ICIs. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CC extract exerts a potent antitumor effect as an immune checkpoint blocker by inhibiting PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and disrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.">

        <tr id="Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as an effective, personalized treatment for certain patients, particularly for those with hematological malignancies. However, its efficacy in breast cancer has been marginal—perhaps due to cold, immune-excluded, or immune-desert tumors. Natural killer T (NKT) cells play a critical role in cancer immune surveillance and are reduced in cancer patients. Thus, we hypothesized that NKT cells could serve as a surrogate marker for immune function. In order to assess which breast cancer patients would likely benefit from immune cell-based therapies, we have developed a quantitative method to rapidly assess NKT function using stimulation with artificial antigen presenting cells followed by quantitative real-time PCR for IFN-γ. We observed a significant reduction in the percentage of circulating NKT cells in breast cancer patients, compared to healthy donors; however, the majority of patients had functional NKT cells. When we compared BC patients with highly functional NKT cells, as indicated by high IFN-γ induction, to those with little to no induction, following stimulation of NKT cells, there was no significant difference in NKT cell number between the groups, suggesting functional loss has more impact than physical loss of this subpopulation of T cells. In addition, we assessed the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression within the tumor microenvironment in the low and high responders. Further characterization of immune gene signatures in these groups identified a concomitant decrease in the induction of TNFα, LAG3, and LIGHT in the low responders. We next investigated the mechanisms by which breast cancers suppress NKT-mediated anti-tumor immune responses. We found that breast cancers secrete immunosuppressive lipids, and treatment with commonly prescribed medications that modulate lipid metabolism, can reduce tumor growth and restore NKT cell responses.">

 Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with immunotherapy failure and a weaker anti- tumor immune response. Using a series of carcinogen-induced tumor (CIT) squamous cell skin carcinoma cell lines, our lab has sought to identify tumor-intrinsic factors—particularly chemokines and cytokines—which can have a “dominant negative” effect on the immune microenvironment when present within a heterogeneous tumor. We identified CX3CL1 as a one such critical mediator of a cold (T cell low) immune microenvironment and found that tumors containing as few as 10% CX3CL1high tumor cells exhibit a diminished T cell response compared to tumors which lack CX3CL1high tumor cells. We predicted that targeting CX3CL1 could therefore transform a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) into an inflammatory hot (T cell high) TME. Supporting this, we found that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of CX3CL1 in a tumor cell line that typically gives rise to cold tumors led to higher T cell infiltration and fewer immunosuppressive macrophages in the TME of CX3CL1-/- tumors. Building on this, we further explored T cell populations in the TME and found that CX3CL1-/- tumors had significantly increased activation and decreased exhaustion markers on T cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed higher expression of CD44 on effector CD4 T cells and an increase in the number of activated CD44+ PD1low CD4 T cells. By contrast, the frequency of CD4 T cells which were PD1High TIM3+ and PD1High TIM3+ TIGIT+ which represent a likely exhausted effector CD4 population was lower in CX3CL1-/- tumors than in counterpart control tumors. An interrogation of DC subsets in the TME further revealed a higher number of cDC1 and cDC2 populations in CX3CL1−/− tumors. To determine the effect of tumor-produced CX3CL1 on immune activity in lymphoid organs, we investigated T cell and DC markers in the spleen and tumor-draining lymph nodes during early tumor development. Spleens harvested 10 days after tumor injection showed higher infiltration of cDC1 CCR7+ and cDC2 CCR7+ mature DCs in CX3CL1-/- tumor-bearing mice. Thus, in the absence of tumor-produced CX3CL1, both cDC1 and cDC2 dendritic cell subsets attain more mature phenotypes in both the TME and the spleen. At the same time point, tumor-draining lymph nodes also exhibited a shift in immune cell composition characterized by an increased frequency of T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, and a decreased frequency of B cells. Moreover, the percentage of PD1+ CD8 cells was also higher, indicating better priming and activation of CD8 T cells via DCs in tumor-draining lymph nodes. These findings indicate that tumor-produced CX3CL1 drives a cold immune microenvironment through both tumor-localized and systemic effects. These studies suggest therapeutically targeting CX3CL1 particularly in tumors where tumor cells produce high levels of CX3CL1 holds promise to transform a cold TME into a hot immune inflammatory TME and potentiate better anti-tumor immunity.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive and highly metastatic breast cancer subtype with limited effective treatment options. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting checkpoint molecules have been widely used and have shown therapeutic efficacy in treating multiple malignancies in the last decade. In TNBC, ICI targeting PD-1, alone or in combination with chemotherapy has been approved for the treatment of patients with both early and advanced stage of the disease. Although, there has been significant clinical benefit achieved from anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy, treatment efficacy is often limited to a subgroup of patients. The limited response to ICIs has been attributed to the increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells (including MDSCs, neutrophils and tumor-associated macrophages), more importantly, the upregulation of alternative immune checkpoint receptors/ligands that may further suppress cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, it has been suggested that targeting other immune checkpoint molecules may be more effective in bolstering anti-tumor immune response. V- domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is one of the immune checkpoint molecules attracting increasing attention in the context of anti-tumor immunity due to its broad expression across various cancer types and increased expression upon development of immune checkpoint resistance. However, the role of VISTA in regulating the anti-tumor immune response and its therapeutic potential in TNBC remains unclear. In our study, we observed that VISTA is expressed in TNBC patients, predominantly in neutrophils and macrophages. In the Py230 murine breast cancer model, VISTA expression increased upon paclitaxel (PTX), anti-PD-L1 and paclitaxel combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment compared to the control group, suggesting its potential role as a resistance mechanism in sustaining or further inhibiting T cells. In the Py230 model, VISTA blockade increased the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells, as evidenced by the higher number of CD8+ T cells, increased CD69+CD8+ T cells, and Granzyme B production, indicating that VISTA blockade improved CD8+ T cells mediated anti-tumor immunity. To functionally test the role of VISTA, we stimulated CD8+ T cells and co-cultured them with naïve macrophages or tumor educated macrophages in the presence or absence of VISTA blocking antibody. Tumor educated macrophages showed increased immunosuppressive activity which was abrogated with VISTA blockade. Moreover, we found that the immunosuppressive effect of macrophages on T cell activation needs direct cell-cell interaction between VISTA on macrophages and T cells. In conclusion, this study shows the mechanism of action of VISTA in the regulation of T cells mediated anti-tumor immune response and provides the rationale for targeting VISTA in TNBC.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most widely diagnosed cancers worldwide. Despite the advances in medical research, there is still a lot to be explored between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, namely immune cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to mediate communication between cells and can modulate the activity of immune cells. External stimuli such as stress and chemotherapy can influence the activity of the released EVs. Nevertheless, the relationship between chemotherapy, EVs and immune cells has yet to be fully explored. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the immune-related functional mechanisms of EVs isolated from pre- and post- FOLFOX chemotherapy from CRC patients. The EVs were isolated from the serum of matched patients and characterized via dynamic light scattering. The EVs were then co-incubated with primary CD8 T cells isolated from healthy donors and Jurkat cells. The apoptosis, cell cycle profile, gene expression and cytokines were evaluated. Upon treatment with EVs, the T cells underwent apoptosis however no differences were seen in the cell cycle phases. Gene expression related to cytokine release was also differentially expressed namely IRF4. The level of cytokines that were released also differed between the two groups. Our study has shown that there are some minor differences in the activity of the EVs after induction with chemotherapy.">

This retrospective analysis included samples from patients treated with T-DXd in three clinical trials. We performed RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry on archival tumor samples obtained at baseline, during treatment, and after treatment. Flow cytometry was performed on tumor infiltrating immune cells freshly isolated from tumor tissues. Samples from 28 patients were included in this study. ERBB2 mRNA levels and CD20+ cell infiltration in tumors were significantly higher at baseline in responders than in nonresponders. Patients were classified into three biological groups based on their baseline tumor/stroma-infiltrating immune cell densities. Two groups reported similar response rates, but a trend was observed toward a shorter progression-free-survival in the group with more immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at baseline. T-DXd treatment tended to increase the levels of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and PD1+CD8+ T cells, particularly in responders. Gene expression signatures of CTL and helper T cells increased during treatment, whereas signatures related to hypoxia, MYC targets, collagen formation, and interleukin-10 were downregulated. Our data suggest that HER2 expression levels and baseline tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics correlate with T-DXd efficacy. Furthermore, this treatment may modulate TME immune profiles. Further validation using a larger sample size is warranted.">

        <tr id="Abstract The transcription factors STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B steer hematopoiesis and immunity, but their enhanced expression and activation promote acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKCL). Current therapeutic strategies focus on blocking upstream tyrosine kinases to inhibit STAT3/5, but these kinase blockers are not selective against STAT3/5 activation and frequent resistance causes relapse, emphasizing the need for targeted drugs. We evaluated the efficacy of JPX‐0700 and JPX‐0750 as dual STAT3/5 binding inhibitors promoting protein degradation. JPX‐0700/−0750 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of STAT3/5 targets involved in cancer survival, metabolism, and cell cycle progression, exhibiting nanomolar to low micromolar efficacy. They induced cell death and growth arrest in both AML/NKCL cell lines and primary AML patient blasts. We found that both AML/NKCL cells hijack STAT3/5 signaling through either upstream activating mutations in kinases, activating mutations in STAT3, mutational loss of negative STAT regulators, or genetic gains in anti‐apoptotic, pro‐proliferative, or epigenetic‐modifying STAT3/5 targets. This emphasizes a vicious cycle for proliferation and survival through STAT3/5. Both JPX‐0700/−0750 treatment reduced leukemic cell growth in human AML or NKCL xenograft mouse models significantly, being well tolerated by mice. Synergistic cell death was induced upon combinatorial use with approved chemotherapeutics in AML/NKCL cells.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of many malignant tumors. However, ICI-induced hyper-immune activation causes cardiotoxicity. Traditional treatments such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants have limited effectiveness and may even accelerate tumor growth. This study aimed to identify approaches that effectively reduce cardiotoxicity and simultaneously preserve or enhance the antitumor immunity of ICI therapy.


METHODS
ICI injection in melanoma-bearing C57BL/6J female mice was used to simulate cardiotoxicity in patients with tumor undergoing immune therapy. MCC950 was used to block nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity. Echocardiography, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to assess cardiac function, immune cell populations, and inflammatory factor levels. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing was used to detect the changes in cardiac transcriptome and immunological network.


RESULTS
NLRP3 inhibition reduced inflammatory response and improved cardiac function. Notably, NLRP3 inhibition also resulted in a pronounced suppression of tumor growth. Single-cell RNA sequencing elucidated that MCC950 treatment reduced the cardiac infiltration of pathogenic macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, activated T cells, and their production of inflammatory cytokines, while enhancing the presence of reparative macrophages and naive T cells. In addition, MCC950 attenuated cardiotoxicity induced by dual programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) immunotherapy and promoted tumor regression, and showed efficacy in treating established cardiotoxicity.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide a promising clinical approach for preventing and treating cardiotoxicity induced by ICIs, dissociating the antitumor efficacy of ICI-based therapies from their cardiotoxic side effects.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

        <tr id="Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly prevalent and heterogeneous among adult acute leukemias. Current chemotherapeutic approaches for AML often face the challenge of drug resistance, and AML immune cells play an important role in the regulation of AML drug resistance. Thus, it is of key significance to explore the regulatory mechanisms of immune cells in AML to alleviate chemotherapy resistance in AML. Methods Based on AML single-cell transcriptomic data, this study revealed the differences in the expression of immune cell subpopulations and marker genes in AML patients in the complete remission group (CR) compared to AML patients in the non-complete remission group (non-CR) after chemotherapy. Functional enrichment by clusterprofiler revealed the regulatory functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AML. AUCell enrichment scores were used to assess the immunoregulatory functions of immune cells. Pseudotime analysis was used to construct immune cell differentiation trajectories. CellChat was used for cellular communication analysis to elucidate the interactions between immune cells. Survival analysis with the R package “survival” revealed the role of immune cell marker genes on AML prognosis. Finally, the wound healing and trans-well assay were performed. Results Single-cell clustering analysis revealed that NK/T cells and macrophage cells subpopulations were significantly higher in non-CR AML patients than in CR AML. AUCell enrichment analysis revealed that FCAR+ and FCGR3A+ macrophages were significantly more active in the non-CR group and correlated with processes regulating cellular energy metabolism and immune cell activity. Differentially expressed NK cell marker genes between CR and non-CR groups mainly included HBA1, S100A8, and S100A9, which were associated with cancer drug resistance regulation, these marker genes of (FCAR, FCGR3A, PREX1, S100A8 and S100A9) were upregulated in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (HAP1) and silencing of S100A8 affected migration and invasion of HAP1 cells. In particular, the differentiation pathways of macrophages and NK cells in non-CR differed from those of patients in the CR group. Cellular communication analyses showed that ligand-receptor pairs between NK cells and macrophage cells mainly included HLA-E-KLRK1, HLA-E-KLRC1, HLA-E-CD94:NKG2A, CLEC2B-KLRB1. In addition, LGALS9-CD45, CCL3L1- CCR1, CCL3-CCR1 between these two immune cells mainly regulate secreted signaling to mediate AML progression. Marker genes in NK/T cells and macrophage cells were significantly associated with AML prognosis. Conclusion This study reveals the potential role of NK cells and macrophages in AML chemoresistance through the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. This provides new ideas and insights into the key mechanisms of immune cells in AML treatment.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using retrovirally transduced T cells represents a promising strategy for enhancing antitumor responses. When used with TriVax, a peptide vaccination strategy, this approach synergistically expands antigen-specific cell populations. STAT5 plays a vital role as a transcription factor in regulating T cell proliferation and their differentiation into effector and memory T cells. We aimed to explore the combination therapy using CD8 T cells engineered to express constitutively active STAT5 (CA-STAT5) with vaccines. CD8 T cells were transduced with a retrovirus (RV) encoding the mouse gp100 T cell receptor (TCR). In certain treatment groups, cells were also co-transduced with RV encoding CA-STAT5. We assessed transduction efficiency and functional activity through flow cytometry and various functional assays. B16F10 tumor-bearing mice were treated with ACT using RV-transduced CD8 T cells and subsequently vaccinated with TriVax. We demonstrate that TriVax selectively enhanced the expansion of ACT cell populations bearing gp100-specific TCRs. T cells engineered to express CA-STAT5 showed not only increased expansion and polyfunctionality but also reduced PD-1 expression, leading to decreased cellular exhaustion. In a B16F10 melanoma mouse model, our approach yielded a potent antitumor effect, with CA-STAT5 further amplifying this response. We found that CA-STAT5 improved antitumor activities, in part, by attenuating the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. These findings indicate that TCR-transduced CD8 T cells can undergo antigen-dependent expansion when exposed to TriVax. Additionally, the expression of CA-STAT5 enhances T cell proliferation and persistence, partly by promoting resistance to PD-1/PD-L1-mediated inhibition in antitumor T cells.">

        <tr id="Malaria remains a significant global public health problem. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells, have the capacity to regulate B cells, plasma cells, and antibody production, among other functions. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) possess strong immunosuppressive abilities and can negatively regulate various immune responses. However, the role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh-cell responses during Plasmodium infection remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cell-mediated immune responses upon Plasmodium infection. We found that the numbers of MDSCs increased upon Plasmodium infection. Further mechanism study revealed that MDSC-derived Arg-1 and PD-L1 prevented Tfh cell proliferation and activation. Conversely, the addition of nor-NOHA or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies enhanced the proliferation and activation of Tfh cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cells was dependent on Arg-1 and PD-1/PD-L1. In vivo depletion of MDSCs enhanced Tfh-cell responses and antibody production, as well as relieved symptoms of infected mice and improved their survival rates. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh cell immune responses and further impairing humoral immunity. Our study provides new strategies for malaria prevention and control.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized immune cells that play a crucial role in presenting antigens and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to combat tumors. The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) can bind to its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This interaction suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Radiation therapy can increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, and detailed studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. As many patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy-either through lack of response or cancer recurrence-there is a critical need to maximize synergistic effects by selecting combination treatments that offer improved therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects. In the present study, immature DCs (iDCs) were introduced directly into irradiated tumor sites (referred as IR/iDCs), and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) were administered intraperitoneally. We confirmed the antitumor effect of combining IR/iDCs and ICBs by examining tumor growth and mouse survival. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes increased in the IR/iDCs-treated groups. Combining IR/iDCs with an anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a significant reduction in distant tumor growth and improved mouse survival rates compared with IR/iDCs alone or IR/iDCs + anti-PD-1 antibody. These findings suggest that integrating radiotherapy, DC-based immunotherapy, and ICB, specifically targeting PD-L1, may be an effective cancer treatment strategy.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, a subset of T cells identified by the surface glycoprotein CD8, particularly those expressing the co-stimulatory molecule CD226, play a crucial role in the immune response to malignancies. However, their role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an immunosuppressive disease, has not yet been explored. We studied 64 CLL patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the proportion of CD226-expressing cells among different CD8+ T cell subsets (including naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effectors) in CLL patients, stratified by Rai stage and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutation status. Additionally, we compared the effector functions of CD8+CD226+ cells and their CD226- counterparts. We also quantified cytokine and chemokine levels in the plasma of CLL and HCs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed the publicly available bulk RNA-seq on CD226+ and CD226-CD8+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated the impact of elevated cytokines/chemokines on CD226 expression. Our results showed that CD226-expressing cells were significantly decreased within the effector memory and effector CD8+ T cell subsets in CLL patients with advanced Rai stages and unmutated IgHV, a marker of poor prognosis. These cells displayed robust effector functions, including cytokine production, cytolytic activity, degranulation, proliferation, and migration capacity. In contrast, CD8+CD226- T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype with reduced Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) were inversely correlated with the frequency of CD8+CD226+ T cells and may contribute to the downregulation of CD226, possibly leading to T cell dysfunction in CLL. Our findings highlight the critical role of CD8+CD226+RUNX2hi T cells in CLL and suggest that their reduction is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. This study also underscores the potential of targeting IL-6 and MIP-1β to preserve polyfunctional CD8+CD226+ T cells as a promising immunotherapy strategy.">

 Many trial data have shown that cancer immunotherapy can successfully induce long lasting anti-cancer immune responses and increased the survival rate of cancer patients. One of the key challenges facing cancer immunotherapy is the low response rate of cancer patients to immunotherapy, suggesting that these cancer patients may have acquired resistance toward immunotherapy before treatments. Therefore, there is an unmet need for identifying the underlying mechanisms that promote resistance. One important hypothesis is that immune-excluded tumors (so called cold tumors) that lack of functional T cells have been often found in cancer patients who cannot respond well to cancer immunotherapy. To address this, we have successfully established a preclinical model for cold lung tumors, conducted RNA-seq, performed hallmark gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on cold tumor cells sorted in vivo, and identified several candidates associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Wnt signaling, type I and II interferon (IFN) signaling, and p53 signaling. We hypothesize that their roles may either promote or inhibit the formation of cold tumors. One of the molecular candidates we identified, a molecule designated as IRC001, represents a crucial proof of concept for our experimental tumor model. We have unveiled a novel role for IRC001 in enhancing anti-tumor immunity, leading to the transformation of cold tumors into hot tumors and facilitating swift tumor regression through pathways reliant on T cells and type I IFN signaling. Our mechanistic studies have shown that IRC001 can trigger type I IFN signaling by engaging STING/TBK-1/IRF3-dependent pathways. To delve deeper into the spatial and molecular distinctions in mouse tumors (± IRC001), we initiated a preliminary study utilizing 10x Genomics/Visium to examine the spatial variations between these tumor types. Significantly, our spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed consistent immune-excluded and immune-enriched characteristics compared to traditional RNA sequencing methods. We conducted an analysis of TCGA datasets (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and observed that elevated IRC001 expression is associated with improved prognosis in SKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma). Furthermore, our bioinformatics analysis revealed that melanoma patients exhibiting heightened IRC001 expression displayed positive responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Therefore, we believe that our experimental tumor model can provide vital insights into the cold tumor microenvironment, shaping future therapeutic strategies, and pinpointing molecular candidates that can assist in selecting patients for successful immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Long-term memory in immune cells is a pivotal aspect of the adaptive immune response, enabling the host to mount rapid and effective defenses against previously encountered pathogens. This review explores the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of immune memory, focusing on memory T cells, memory B cells, and long-lived plasma cells. Following primary infections or vaccinations, a subset of activated lymphocytes transitions into memory cells, which persist long after pathogen clearance. Factors influencing memory cell longevity, such as antigen persistence, cytokine signaling, and homeostatic proliferation, are discussed. Moreover, the review addresses the challenges posed by chronic infections and the potential for immune exhaustion, which can impair memory function. Additionally, the clinical implications of understanding immune memory are highlighted, particularly in vaccine development, cancer immunotherapy, and the management of autoimmune diseases. By synthesizing current knowledge on long-term memory in immune cells, this review aims to provide insights into future research directions and therapeutic strategies to enhance immune responses and improve public health outcomes.

        <tr id="Recently, immune function assessment has gained prominence in clinical settings. Immune functional assays (IFAs), involving in vitro stimulation, offer a relevant approach to complement traditional immunomonitoring methods which, while widely used, do not fully capture functional immune capabilities. Despite growing interest in IFAs, their added value remains unclear. To address this gap, our study aimed to determine if insights from IFAs could be replicated with unstimulated immunoprofiling. Using the same analytical pipeline, we compared transcriptomic profiles (Nanostring) between stimulated (TruCulture) and unstimulated (PaxGene) samples from i) patients with an overstimulated immune system 3-4 days post-sepsis onset, and ii) patients undergoing immune reconstitution 6-months post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In sepsis, post-stimulation transcriptomic profiles revealed immune clusters linked to disease severity and outcomes, surpassing traditional markers like mHLA-DR, while baseline analyses failed to generate clinically relevant stratification. Similarly, allo-HSCT patients' post-stimulation data revealed immune heterogeneity and treatment-related alterations not detected using baseline transcriptomic or cellular profiles alone. Our findings emphasize the value of IFAs in uncovering functional immune alterations that unstimulated assessments may miss, which could offer deeper insights into immune dysfunction. This study supports IFAs as complementary tools to current clinical practices, enhancing patient management with a functional view of immune system dynamics.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells capable of directly killing target cells while modulating immune effector responses. Despite their multifunctional capacities, a limited understanding of their plasticity and heterogeneity has impeded progress in developing effective NK cell-based cancer therapies. In this study, we investigated NK cell tissue heterogeneity in relation to their phenotype and effector functions against lung tumors. Methods Using hanging drop tumor spheroid and subcutaneously established LL/2 (LLC1) lung tumor models, we examined NK cell receptor diversity and its correlation with tissue-specific cytotoxicity through multiparametric flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and cytotoxicity assays. Results We identified distinct patterns of cell surface receptors expression on tissue-specific NK cells that are crucial for antitumor activity. Linear regression mathematical analyses further revealed significant positive correlations between activation-associated cell surface receptors and cytotoxic capacity in NK cells from tissues such as the liver and bone marrow. Conclusion These findings underscore the differential effector capacities of NK cells from distinct tissues, even prior to exposure to LL/2 tumor cells. This highlights the significance of tissue-specific NK cell heterogeneity and its impact on their antitumor cytotoxicity. Recognizing these distinct tissue-specific receptor expression patterns will be instrumental in developing more efficacious NK cell-based cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Several cancer treatments that have been used for quite a few decades include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. These resulted in significant responses and the prolongation of survival for a subset of cancer patients. Another subset was not responsive to such treatments and many of the originally responding patients became unresponsive to subsequent treatments and succumbed to the disease. Fortunately, a new treatment was introduced that takes advantage of the patient’s immune response to fight the cancer and eradicate it, as it does with viral and microbial infections too. The immune response to cancer is called “immunotherapy”. Several immunotherapeutic approaches were developed and approved by the FDA for various cancers, and yield significant clinical responses and the prolongation of survival in many cancer patients. Immunotherapy depends largely on the patient’s immune response being activated and killing the tumor cells. Killing the tumor cells is mediated by immune cells, called CD8 T cells, which need to locate and bind to the cancer cells to kill them. Interestingly, cancer cells strive to survive and escape their death via the CD8 T cells. They manifest this clever approach by inducing various markers on their surface that will prevent them from killing the cancer cells, resulting in the survival and growth of the cancer cells. Therefore, such a failure of immunotherapy required a remedy. Indeed, a remedy was found through which these markers were inhibited therapeutically by agents approved by the FDA, resulting in the cancer cells’ ability to inhibit the CD8 T cells being overridden. Such approved agents were very effective in many cancer patients, but unfortunately not all. Here too we needed to develop other therapies to treat the unresponsive patients. Here, we describe a novel approach that involves using an agent that inhibits the expression of the above inhibitory markers on the CD8 T cells, allowing them to be active and kill the cancer cells in unresponsive patients. It is worthwhile to develop this new approach through research investigation and clinical trials.">

Augmenting NK cell function with oncological drugs could improve NK cell-based immunotherapies. Here, we used a high-throughput drug screen consisting of over 500 small-molecule compounds to systematically evaluate the effects of oncological drugs on primary NK cells against CML cells. We identified SMAC mimetics as potent enhancers of NK cell cytotoxicity in both cell lines and primary patient samples. In contrast, several drug classes, including glucocorticoids and tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib, inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed drug-induced transcriptomic changes in both NK and target CML cells. SMAC mimetics upregulated NF-κB target genes in NK cells, potentially contributing to their enhanced cytotoxicity. Inhibitory drugs dexamethasone, dasatinib, and sotrastaurin prevented NK cell transition to an activated state and suppressed the expression of IFN-γ by NK cells, thus preventing IFN-γ mediated target cell transcriptomic response. In conclusion, we discovered that SMAC mimetics sensitize cancer cells to NK cell mediated killing, with potential clinical applications especially in patients with advanced phase CML.">

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy represents a pivotal treatment modality in clinical practice. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), a key subset of B lymphocytes, hold promise in the management of autoimmune diseases, cancer and transplantation immunity. The expansion of Bregs for cell therapy is a promising strategy to alleviate inflammation and promote immune tolerance. Achieving immune tolerance relies on balance between regulatory and effector cells. One primary objective of cellular therapy is to shift this balance towards Bregs, fostering a more tolerant immune microenvironment. The adoptive transfer of Bregs not only increases their quantity but also modulates the number and function of other immune cells. Maximizing in vitro expansion of Bregs and enhancing their regulatory functions are key focuses in transplant immunology. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the in vitro expansion of IL-10-secreting B cells (B10) remain inadequately understood. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the signaling pathways involved in B10 activation and expansion, as well as to highlight the techniques for in vitro amplification and development of adoptive B10 therapy in transplantation, which aims to advance the field of cellular therapy targeting Bregs.">

        <tr id="Considering the general view that unconventional immune effectors play a major role in antitumor immunity, we recently postulated that the distinct new innate CD8 T-cell pool (co-expressing the transcription factor Eomesodermin and innate markers such as KIR/NKG2A) may counteract tumor cells, and thereby be potential target for cancer therapy. Here, to test this assumption, we used successfully targeted anti-leukemic therapy discontinuation (TFR) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Numerical and functional status of innate CD8 T-cells, iNKT cells and γδ T-cells, in comparison with NK cells, was compared longitudinally between non-relapsed patients (i.e., with > 12 months TFR) and relapsed patients (i.e., who experienced molecular recurrence during the first 12 months after TKI cessation) in a prospective pilot cohort (n=32), starting from treatment discontinuation (D0). Perforin, a key cytotoxic immune player, was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of both innate CD8 T-cell and NK-cell subsets in non-relapsed patients, compared with relapsed patients at D0. In parallel, we assessed the expression of PD-1, an exhaustion marker used as target in cancer therapy. For all T-cell subsets, surface-expression level of PD-1 decreased in non-relapsed patients compared with relapsed patients at D0. This was particularly the case when considering iNKT cells for which surface-expression level of PD-1 even decreased relative to healthy control subjects. Lastly, we found a negative correlation between the proportion of innate CD8 T-cells expressing PD-1 and those expressing perforin in non-relapsed patients at D0. The fact that this was not the case in conventional CD8 T-cells is compatible with a reprogrammed effector profile preferentially targeting innate CD8 T-cells in non-relapsed patients. All in all, our results highlight NK cells and innate CD8 T-cells harboring cytotoxic content, as well as global downregulation of PD-1-expression on effector T-cells, as potential predictive functional signatures for successful TFR in CML. Considering innate CD8 T-cells, further investigations are needed to determine whether their possible contributory role in cancer surveillance in CML could be extended to other cancers, and also whether their targeting by immune cheek-point inhibitors could enhance their anti-tumoral functions.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by its ability to evade the immune system, hindering the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Recent research has highlighted the important role of immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in driving this immune evasion. In this study, we are the first to identify THEMIS2 as a key regulator of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated immunosuppression in GBM. We found that a high THEMIS2 expression is associated with poor patient outcomes and increased infiltration of immune cells, particularly macrophages. Functional analyses revealed THEMIS2’s critical involvement in immune-related pathways, including immune response activation, mononuclear cell differentiation, and the positive regulation of cytokine production. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated that macrophages with a high THEMIS2 expression were associated with increased phagocytosis, immune suppression, and enhanced tumor growth. These findings suggest that THEMIS2 could serve as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in GBM.">

        <tr id="Abstract Malignant glioma, the most lethal form of brain cancer, presents with an immunosuppressive microenvironment that obstructs tumor cell clearance and hampers immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite advancements in characterizing cellular and extracellular profiles in cancer, the immunosuppressive mechanisms specific to glioma remain poorly understood. We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of glioma samples, which revealed a select subset of human and mouse glioma cells that express CD83, a marker associated with mature antigen-presenting cells. To investigate the impact of tumor cell CD83 expression on glioma outcomes, we used an immunocompetent mouse model of glioma, bioinformatic analyses of human samples, and in vitro assays. Our findings revealed that CD83+ tumor cells contribute to tumor growth suppression and are associated with enhanced cytotoxic T-cell profiles and activated CD8+ T cells. Increased proinflammatory cytokines were identified in CD83-overexpressing tumor conditions, which were also correlated with long-term CD8+ antitumor responses. Importantly, tumor-derived CD83 could mediate communication with T cells, altering the immune microenvironment to potentially enhance immune-related tumor clearance. Collectively, our data suggest that tumor cell expression of CD83 supports the endogenous antitumor T-cell constituency in malignant glioma. Future research endeavors may aim to further investigate whether CD83 expression can enhance immunotherapeutic approaches and improve patient outcomes. Significance: Immunosuppression in malignant glioma remains a barrier to therapeutic development. CD83 overexpression in human and mouse glioma increases survival. CD83+ tumor cells promote signatures related to cytotoxic T cells, enhanced activation of CD8+ T cells, and increased proinflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that tumor-expressed CD83 could mediate tumor–immune communications.">

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer (BC) cases worldwide, yet due to its aggressive phenotype and lack of targeted therapies it has the worst prognosis amongst BC subtypes. Up to 40% of TNBC patients will relapse after treatment and develop distant metastasis. Metastasis is the complex process by which disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) leave the primary tumor and grow at distal sites. Since most metastases occur within 3 years of diagnosis, the rapid onset and lack of effective treatments in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) means less than 20% of patients survive after 4 years. Even though it is the most “immune-activated” BC subtype, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown clinical benefits in early TNBC, there is a clear need for novel immunotherapeutic approaches for patients with mTNBC. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that function as the body’s first line defense against metastatic cancer cells. NK cells eliminate DTCs in the blood or at distal sites via NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and this process is known to be impaired in successful metastasis. We hypothesized that other cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can inhibit NKCC at the earliest stages of metastatic outgrowth. We have used Cherry-niche, an in vivo labelling tool, to characterize how TME cells change in early and established lung micro-metastases by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry. Our initial analyses showed that monocytes are highly enriched, not only in the entire metastatic lung, but specifically in the established niche surrounding DTCs. Although we detected a slight increase in total NK cells, there was a shift in maturation status with fewer mature NK cells (CD27-CD11b+) and more immature NK cells (CD27+/-CD11b-) in the metastatic lung. Furthermore, NK cells were largely absent from the metastatic niche and those that were present displayed a dysfunctional phenotype. CellChat and NicheNet analyses of our scRNA-seq data predicted that several receptor-ligand interactions, including the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), can mediate the crosstalk between NK cells and monocytes. Next, we developed an in vitro 3D co-culture system to study the effect of blood-derived monocytes on human NKCC against mTNBC cells. We found that monocytes can suppress NKCC against MDA-MB-231 cells and decrease the viability of mature NK cells. Furthermore, recombinant MIF was able to directly inhibit NKCC, whilst a selective MIF antagonist was able to rescue monocyte-induced impairment of NKCC. These data implicate MIF as a critical monocyte-derived factor in the suppression of NK cell function against mTNBC cells. Future work will aim to identify the exact mechanism by which MIF inhibits NKCC, whilst also evaluate the effect of monocyte depletion and MIF inhibition on metastatic outgrowth and NK cell activation/maturation in vivo. This study will reveal novel inter-cellular dynamics occurring in the metastatic lung, as well as immunotherapeutic targets that may restore NKCC in mTNBC.

        <tr id="Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD38 are a therapeutic mainstay in multiple myeloma (MM). While they have contributed to improved outcomes, most patients still experience disease relapse, and little is known about tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to these drugs. Antigen escape has been implicated as a mechanism of tumor cell evasion in immunotherapy. Yet, it is unknown whether MM cells can develop permanent resistance to anti-CD38 antibodies by acquiring genomic events leading to biallelic disruption of the CD38 gene locus. Here, by using whole genome and whole exome sequencing data from 701 newly diagnosed patients, 67 patients at relapse with naivety to anti-CD38 antibodies, and 50 patients collected at relapse following anti-CD38 antibodies. We report a loss of CD38 in 20% (10/50) of patients post-CD38 therapy, three of which exhibited a loss of both copies. Two of these cases showed convergent evolution where distinct subclones independently acquired similar advantageous variants. Functional studies on missense mutations involved in biallelic CD38 events revealed that two variants, L153H and C275Y, decreased binding affinity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of the commercial antibodies Daratumumab and Isatuximab. However, a third mutation, R140G, conferred selective resistance to Daratumumab, while retaining sensitivity to Isatuximab. Clinically, patients with MM are often rechallenged with CD38 antibodies following disease progression and these data support a role for next generation sequencing to guide treatment selection.">

To investigate the function of mitophagy in instructing T-cell differentiation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).


METHOD
The mRNA and protein levels of optic atrophy protein-1 were detected in T cells from 94 RA patients and 37 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The impact of mitophagy on the differentiation of T cells was determined by flow cytometry. The therapeutic effect of targeting mitophagy was explored in humanized RA chimeras.


RESULTS
Our study showed that T cells exerted high levels of mitophagy in RA patients. Since multiple T-cell subtypes play crucial roles in RA, we determined that mitophagy had a significant impact on the differentiation of tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells, but not Th1 or Th17 cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that inhibiting mitophagy significantly reduced the number of Trm cells and downregulated inflammatory responses, as evidenced by diminished levels of T cell receptor β, interferon-γ, and interleukin-17A, in the humanized RA chimeras.


CONCLUSIONS
Mitophagy is elevated in RA T cells, leading to maldifferentiation of Trm cells in RA patients. Since these findings were obtained from clinical patients, mitophagy may be a potential therapeutic target for RA treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract The elderly and those with chronic diseases have a 2 to 10-fold increased risk of hospitalization and mortality following infection as compared with healthy adults. A significant contributor to disease severity is the aging of the immune system, including an expansion of exhausted T cells. These cells simultaneously promote excessive levels of inflammation and display impaired T cell activation and function. How exhausted T cells from aged individuals respond to infection and whether acute restoration of T cell activation further exacerbates the inflammatory environment or generates functional T cells is unclear. Previously, we used a mouse model of normal microbial experience (NME), where old specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice show 100% mortality following exposure to multiple microbes ordinarily found in pet store mice. In the present study, we show that when exposed to NME, old SPF mice have increased expression of multiple inflammatory pathways and exhibit elevated frequencies of a heterogenous exhausted CD8+ T cell pool that expresses differing combinations of the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), TOX, and CXCR5. Pre-treatment or intervention with an anti-PD1 monoclonal blocking antibody during the exposure of old SPF mice to NME significantly improves both antibody production and survival, without altering the acute inflammatory response. Anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade-mediated survival is dependent on CD8+, but not CD4+ T cells. Correspondingly, CD8+ PD1+ T cells from old mice given anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody have increased granzyme B production. These data reveal a new approach for reducing vulnerability to infections in the elderly by targeting CD8+ T cell exhaustion through PD1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the key immunosuppressive components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and contribute to tumor development, progression, and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Several reagents targeting TAMs have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies, but they have had limited success. Here, we show that a unique reagent, FF-10101, exhibited a sustained inhibitory effect against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor by forming a covalent bond and reduced immunosuppressive TAMs in the TME, which led to strong antitumor immunity. In preclinical animal models, FF-10101 treatment significantly reduced immunosuppressive TAMs and increased antitumor TAMs in the TME. In addition, tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were increased; consequently, tumor growth was significantly inhibited. Moreover, combination treatment with an anti–programmed cell death 1 (anti–PD-1) antibody and FF-10101 exhibited a far stronger antitumor effect than either treatment alone. In human cancer specimens, FF-10101 treatment reduced programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on TAMs, as observed in animal models. Thus, FF-10101 acts as an immunomodulatory agent that can reduce immunosuppressive TAMs and augment tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, thereby generating an immunostimulatory TME. We propose that FF-10101 is a potential candidate for successful combination cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.">

        <tr id="Background: The innate immune response aims to prevent pathogens from entering the organism and/or to facilitate pathogen clearance. Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells (MCs), natural killer cells and neutrophils, bear pattern recognition receptors and are thus able to recognize common molecular patterns, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the later occurring in the context of neuroinflammation. An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise “primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative” disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention. Activated MCs are multifunctional effector cells generated from hematopoietic stem cells that, together with dendritic cells, represent first-line immune defense mechanisms against pathogens and/or tissue destruction. Methods: This review aims to summarize evidence of MC implication in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Results: In view of recent evidence that the gut–brain axis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the characterization of the neuroinflammatory component in the pathology of these diseases, this review also focuses on MCs as potential mediators in the gut–brain axis bi-directional communication and the possible role of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen known to alter the gut–brain axis homeostasis towards local and systemic pro-inflammatory responses. Conclusion: As MCs and Helicobacter pylori infection may offer targets of intervention with potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disease, more clinical and translational evidence is needed to elucidate this field.">

Using an in vivo tumor model, we show that intratumoral ieILC1-like NK cells induce greater T cell trafficking into the tumor. Co-culture of ieILC1-like NK cells with the tumor cells resulted in elevated CXCL10 in the supernatant. Flow cytometry demonstrated that ieILC1-like NK cells produce robust amounts of IFNy, a known CXCL10 inducer, while CXCL10 was produced by tumor cells. These results indicate ieILC1-like NK cells induce tumor production of CXCL10, a proinflammatory chemokine that promotes T cell infiltration into the TME. The role of ieILC1-like NK cells in modulating clinical responses to immune checkpoint blockade warrants investigation.">

We investigated PSMC elimination by host immunity using hyperdifferentiated melanoma model cells derived from murine B16F10 melanoma cells. Exposure of B16F10 cells to staurosporine induced a hyperdifferentiated phenotype associated with transient drug tolerance. Staurosporine-induced hyperdifferentiated B16F10 (sB16F10) cells expressed calreticulin on their surface and were phagocytosed efficiently. Furthermore, the inoculation of mice with sB16F10 cells induced immune responses against tumor-derived antigens. Despite the immunogenicity of sB16F10 cells, they activated the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system and strongly resisted T cell-mediated tumor destruction. However, in vivo treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors successfully eliminated the tumor. Thus, hyperdifferentiated melanoma cells have conflicting immunological properties – enhanced immunogenicity and immune evasion. Inhibiting the ability of PSMCs to evade T cell-mediated elimination might lead to complete melanoma eradication.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunotherapy that targets immune checkpoints has achieved revolutionary success, but its application in solid tumors remains limited, highlighting the need for reliable enhancement of the efficacy of immunotherapy. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a Golgi membrane protein, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including immune regulation. Recent studies suggested that GP73 may play a role in modulating the immune response in patients with cancer. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which GP73 regulates T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment.


METHODS
We used T-cell specific GP73 knockout mice to establish MC38 and B16 tumor models to investigate the impact of GP73-deficient T cells on tumor growth. Single-cell sequencing was subsequently employed to classify tumor-infiltrating immune cells and assess changes in cytokines and metabolic genes. Through RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, seahorse analysis, glucose uptake, and L-lactic acid secretion assays, we explored how GP73 regulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) to influence T-cell antitumor functionality. Furthermore, we established adoptive transfer experiments to study the ability of GP73-overexpressing T cells to combat tumors. Blood samples of patient with clinical tumor were collected to assess the relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and T-cell GP73 levels.


RESULTS
In this study, the absence of GP73 in mouse T cells promoted tumor growth and metastasis, accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+T cell subsets infiltrating the tumor and an increase in exhausted CD8+ T-cell subsets. Further analysis revealed that the effector function of CD8+T cells in tumors relies on glycolysis regulated by HIF-1α rather than immune checkpoints. GP73-deficient T cells exhibit severely impaired glycolysis in hypoxic environments, whereas ectopic GP73 expression restores HIF-1α levels. In adoptive immunotherapy, overexpression of GP73 in T cells inhibits tumor growth. In cytotoxicity assays, knockdown of GP73 affected the ability of CD8+T cells to kill target cells. Clinically, tumor immunotherapy partial response patients present significantly elevated levels of GP73 expression in T cells.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings reveal the role of GP73 in regulating T-cell glycolysis and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the prognosis and treatment of clinical tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction The current study focuses on understanding the functional role of different subsets of endoneurial macrophages in autoimmune polyneuropathies (AP) and traumatic peripheral nerve injury (TPNI), which holds potential for clinical application. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the diverse origins of macrophages within peripheral nerves. However, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding how endoneurial macrophages from different origins affect disease progression in AP versus TPNI. Methods Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze macrophage phenotypes, including polarization states, cytokine production, and myelin phagocytosis in animal models of AP and TPNI. This study focuses on two distinct origins of macrophages, namely CD11b+F4/80hi tissue-resident (TRM) and CD11b+F4/80int blood-derived macrophages (BDM). The study utilized two animal models: the first was the spontaneous autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy (SAPP) model in B7.2-null non-obese diabetic (NOD-B7.2-/-) mice, which serves as a model for inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; the second model involved wild type C57BL/6 mice subjected to sciatic nerve crush injury, modeling TPNI. Behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological analyses were performed to assess peripheral nerve injury. Results The study found that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by macrophages were more pronounced in the peripheral nerves of SAPP mice compared to those with TPNI, with the majority of these macrophages being TRM. In contrast, endoneurial macrophages in mice with TPNI were mainly BDM, exhibiting a less defined macrophage polarization and cytokine profile than TRM in AP mice. Interestingly, myelin phagocytosis was primarily driven by BDM in both SAPP and TPNI mice. Discussion This study offers novel insights into origin-dependent macrophage functions in AP and TPNI. Furthermore, these findings may help the future development of novel therapies targeting macrophage subsets of specific origin in AP and TPNI.">

        <tr id="Mast cell (MCs) activation is the driving force of immune responses in several inflammatory diseases, including asthma and allergies. MCs are immune cells found throughout the body and are equipped with numerous surface receptors that allow them to respond to external signals from parasites and bacteria as well as to intrinsic signals such as cytokines. Upon activation, MCs release various mediators and proteases that contribute to inflammation. This study aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate MC response to interleukin-33 and their target genes using a model of human cord blood-derived mast cells (hCBMCs). hCBMCs were induced with 10 and 20 ng of recombinant human interleukin-33 (rhIL-33) for 6 and 24 h, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from these cells and miRNA profiling was performed using high-throughput microarrays. Differential expression of miRNAs and target analysis were performed using Transcriptome Analysis Console and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The most significant miRNAs in each condition were miR-6836-5p (fold change = 1.76, p = 3E-03), miR-6883-5p (fold change = -2.13, p = 7E-05), miR-1229-5p (fold change = 2.46, p = 8E-04), and miR-3613-5p (fold change = 66.7, p = 1E-06). Target analysis revealed that these miRNAs regulate mast cell responsiveness and degranulation by modulating the expression of surface receptors, adaptors, and signaling molecules in response to rhIL-33 stimulation. This study is the first miRNA profiling and target analysis of hCBMCs that will further enhance our understanding of the role of miRNAs in the immune response in a timely manner and their relevance for the development of a new therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a heterogenous population of myeloid cells that dictate the inflammatory tone of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we unveiled a mechanism by which scavenger receptor CD36 suppresses TAM inflammatory states. CD36 was upregulated in TAMs and associated with immunosuppressive features, and myeloid-specific deletion of CD36 significantly reduced tumor growth. Moreover, CD36-deficient TAMs acquired inflammatory signatures including elevated type-I interferon (IFN-I) production, mirroring the inverse correlation between CD36 and IFN-I response observed in cancer patients. IFN-I, especially IFNβ, produced by CD36-deficient TAMs directly induced tumor cell quiescence and delayed tumor growth. Mechanistically, CD36 acted as a natural suppressor of IFN-I signaling in macrophages through p38 activation downstream of oxidized lipid signaling. These findings establish CD36 as a critical regulator of TAM function and the tumor inflammatory microenvironment, providing additional rationale for pharmacological inhibition of CD36 to rejuvenate anti-tumor immunity.">

 Despite promising results with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, brain metastases (BrM) remain a deadly complication for cancer patients. Understanding the highly specialized brain metastatic tumor microenvironment (BrTME) is crucial for identifying determinants of response, however, progress has been hindered by limited access to patient samples and scarcity of relevant preclinical models. Here, we developed two mouse melanoma BrM models by intracardiac injection of cells derived from our previously established M4-B2905 melanoma mouse cell line. We characterized their mutational landscape and performed single-cell phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis, demonstrating that these models recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of human melanoma BrMs. Comparative and interactome analysis of our models revealed key factors contributing to ICB response and resistance. We found that the responsive model (BR1) was characterized by tumor cells that polarize microglia toward reactive states via inflammatory programs and response to IFN signaling. These microglia express high levels of antigen presentation and immunostimulatory molecules, triggering T cell recruitment and activation and promoting ICB therapy response. In contrast, in the resistant model (BR3), the tumor cells express neurological molecular signatures and ligands that sustain microglia homeostasis. This results in poor T cell infiltration predominantly composed of naïve cells, evading immune reaction and promoting ICB resistance. While we showed that systemic ICB therapy induced BrTME changes in both models, differences between responder and resistant models were maintained, emphasizing the importance of tumor cell-intrinsic programs in dictating the BrTME. We validated the translational relevance of our findings and demonstrated that BR1 signatures positively correlate with T cell infiltration and are associated with improved patient outcomes, whereas BR3 signatures negatively correlate with T cells and are found in patients with worse prognosis. Here we address an important challenge in the field by providing clinically relevant BrM models that recapitulate both the cellular and molecular features of human disease and the variability of ICB response seen in patients. We further reveal mechanistic insights into BrM ICB response and identify potential therapeutic targets to modulate the BrTME.

        <tr id="Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a complex early pregnancy complication affecting 1–2% of couples and is often linked to immune dysfunction. Aberrations in T and B cell subpopulations, as well as natural killer (NK) cell activity, are particularly influential, with studies showing that abnormal NK cell activation and imbalances in T and B cell subtypes contribute to immune-mediated miscarriage risk. Successful pregnancy requires a tightly regulated balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses. In the early stages, inflammation supports processes such as trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling, but this must be tempered to prevent immune rejection of the fetus. In this review, we explore the underlying immune mechanisms of RPL, focusing on how dysregulated T, B, and NK cell function disrupts maternal tolerance. Specifically, we discuss the essential role of uterine NK cells in the early stages of vascular remodeling in the decidua and regulate the depth of invasion by extravillous trophoblasts. Furthermore, we focus on the delicate Treg dynamics that enable the maintenance of optimal immune homeostasis, where the balance, and not only the quantity of Tregs, is crucial for fostering maternal–fetal tolerance. Other T cell subpopulations, such as Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, also contribute to immune imbalance, with Th1 and Th17 cells promoting inflammation and potentially harming fetal tolerance, while Th2 cells support immune tolerance. Finally, we show how changes in B cell subpopulations and their functions have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We further discuss current therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting these immune imbalances, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), glucocorticoids, and TNF-α inhibitors, examining their efficacy, challenges, and potential side effects. By highlighting both the therapeutic benefits and limitations of these interventions, we aim to offer a balanced perspective on clinical applications for women facing immune-related causes of RPL.">

        <tr id="Abstract The treatment landscape for lymphoma and multiple myeloma, which disproportionally affect older adults, has been transformed by the advent of T cell-mediated immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibition, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, during the last decade. These treatment modalities re-enable the patient’s own immune system to combat malignant cells and offer the potential for sustained remissions and cure for various diseases. Age profoundly affects the physiological function of the immune system. The process of biological aging is largely driven by inflammatory signaling, which is reciprocally fueled by aging-related alterations of physiology and metabolism. In the T cell compartment, aging contributes to T cell senescence and exhaustion, increased abundance of terminally differentiated cells, a corresponding attrition in naïve T cell numbers, and a decrease in the breadth of the receptor repertoire. Furthermore, inflammatory signaling drives aging-related pathologies and contributes to frailty in older individuals. Thus, there is growing evidence of biological aging modulating the efficacy and toxicity of T cell-mediated immunotherapies. Here, we review the available evidence from biological and clinical studies focusing on the relationship between T cell-mediated treatment of hematologic malignancies and age. We discuss biological features potentially impacting clinical outcomes in various scenarios, and potential strategies to improve the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T cell therapy in older patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects.

 The unique brain immune microenvironment (BrIME) co-evolves with brain metastasis (BrM) and is marked by immune suppression, posing a significant therapeutic challenge. BrIME is dominated by myeloid cells, with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) comprising nearly half of the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. Targeting MDMs remains challenging due to their inherent heterogeneity and high plasticity, which are regulated by epigenetic modifiers, including histone deacetylases (HDACs). Yet, the impact of HDAC inhibition in BrIME and its implications for BrM immunotherapy remains unclear. Here, we establish BrM syngenetic model by intracarotid artery (ICA) injection. Immune profiling by mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis shows that selective class I HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) Entinostat (ENT) significantly enriches inflammatory MDMs in E0771 murine mammary tumor BrM model. Additionally, functional assay with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) shows that ENT significantly enhances tumor cell phagocytosis and antigen presentation, increasing the proliferation of antigen-specific T cells in vitro. To test whether HDAC inhibition enhances antitumoral response in the BrIME, we designed a novel sequential treatment: with (1) ENT pre-conditioning the BrIME, (2) low- dose whole brain radiotherapy (LD-WBRT) to release tumor antigen followed by (3) anti-PD1 immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) to reinvigorate tumor-infiltrating. Our result shows that sequential triple treatment demonstrates significant BrM deterrence and induce a specific interferon-responsive MDM subset with robust type I interferon response in single-cell RNA sequencing, correlating with improved ICT clinical outcomes. Our data show that selective HDACi treatment reprograms the suppressive BrIME by steering the BrM-infiltrating MDMs toward immuno-stimulatory status. Sequential triple combinatorial therapy impedes BrM by activating innate and adaptive immunity simultaneously and is well tolerated in the animal model. Our findings highlight the potential of HDACi-mediated epigenetic reprogramming of the BrIME to enhance therapeutic efficacy in treating BrM.

        <tr id="Abstract. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cell therapy has been hampered in solid tumors by an incomplete understanding of tumor-infiltrating NK cells. Based on the development of single-cell sequencing methods, this paper used single-cell sequencing data of NK cells from the GEO database to cluster them, focused on the CD56brightCD16lo-CREM subpopulation, which was statistically screened for differential genes and investigated its gene pathways. The results showed that this subpopulation can provide energy for tumor proliferation by promoting ribosomal autophagy, and at the same time express cell adhesion molecules, cytokines and related proteins to interact with monocytes and macrophages, hindering the function of NK cells and promoting tumor progression. This provides new ideas for in-depth analysis of the immunological role of NK cells in pan-cancer tumors.">

        <tr id="T cell-based therapies, including Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy (TIL), T cell receptor engineered T cells (TCR T), and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR T), are powerful therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. While these therapies are primarily known for their direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, accumulating evidence indicates that they also influence the tumor microenvironment (TME), by altering the cytokine milieu and recruiting additional effector populations to help orchestrate the antitumor immune response. Conversely, the TME itself can modulate the behaviour of these therapies within the host by either supporting or inhibiting their activity. In this review we provide an overview of clinical and preclinical data on the bidirectional influences between T cell therapies and the TME. Unravelling the interactions between T cell-based therapies and the TME is critical for a better understanding of their mechanisms of action, resistance, and toxicity, with the goal of optimizing efficacy and safety.">

        <tr id="Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is associated with germline RUNX1 mutations, establishing a preleukemic state and increasing the risk of developing leukemia. Currently, there are no intervention strategies to prevent leukemia progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 10) combined with functional analysis of samples from patients with RUNX1-FPD (n > 75) revealed that FPD hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) displayed increased myeloid differentiation and suppressed megakaryopoiesis because of increased activation of prosurvival and inflammatory pathways. Bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD contained an elevated cytokine milieu, exerting chronic inflammatory stress on HSPCs. RUNX1-FPD HSPCs were myeloid biased, had increased self-renewal, and were resistant to inflammation-mediated exhaustion. The bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD showed high transcript and protein expression of CD74 at the preleukemic stage compared with that of healthy controls, which remained high upon patient transformation into leukemia. Further, CD74-mediated signaling was exaggerated in RUNX1-FPD HSPCs compared with healthy controls, leading to the activation of mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways with increased cytokine production. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of CD74 with ISO-1 and its downstream targets JAK1/2 and mTOR reversed RUNX1-FPD differentiation defects in vitro and in vivo and reduced inflammation. Our results highlight that inflammation is an early event in RUNX1-FPD pathogenesis, and CD74 signaling is one of the drivers of this inflammation. The repurposing of JAK1/2i (ruxolitinib) and mTORi (sirolimus) and promoting the advancement of CD74 inhibitors in clinical settings as an early intervention strategy would be beneficial to improve the phenotype of patients with RUNX1-FPD and prevent myeloid progression.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a distinct type of stress-induced regulated cell death that can lead to adaptive immune responses and the establishment of immunological memory. ICD exhibits both similarities and differences when compared to apoptosis and other non-apoptotic forms of regulated cell death (RCD). The interplay between ICD-mediated immunosurveillance against cancer and the ability of cancer cells to evade ICD influences the host-tumor immunological interaction. Consequently, the restoration of ICD and the development of effective strategies to induce ICD have emerged as crucial considerations in the treatment of cancer within the context of immunotherapy. To enhance comprehension of ICD in the setting of cancer, this paper examines the interconnected responsive pathways associated with ICD, the corresponding biomarkers indicative of ICD, and the mechanisms through which tumors subvert ICD. Additionally, this review explores strategies for reinstating ICD and the therapeutic potential of harnessing ICD in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Repeated antigen exposure leads to T-cell exhaustion, a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cellular state marked by loss of effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity, cytokine production/release), up-regulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1), and reduced proliferative capacity. Molecular pathways underlying T-cell exhaustion have been defined for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but which factors drive exhaustion in CD4+ T cells, that are also required for an effective immune response against a tumor or infection, remains unclear. Here, we utilize quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular basis of the dysfunctional cell state induced by chronic stimulation of CD4+ memory T cells. We identified a dynamic response encompassing both known and novel up-regulated cell surface receptors, as well as dozens of unexpected transcriptional regulators. Integrated causal network analysis of our combined data predicts the histone acetyltransferase p300 as a driver of aspects of this phenotype following chronic stimulation, which we confirmed via targeted small molecule inhibition. While our integrative analysis also revealed large-scale metabolic reprogramming, our independent investigation confirmed a global remodeling away from glycolysis to a dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation-based metabolism coincident with oxidative stress. Overall, these data provide both insights into the mechanistic basis of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and serve as a valuable resource for future interventional studies aimed at modulating T-cell dysfunction.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Natural killer (NK) cells are integral components of the innate immune system, serving a vital function in eliminating virally infected cells. This review highlights the significance of CXCR5+ NK cells in the context of chronic HIV/SIV infection and viral control.


RECENT FINDINGS
Controlled HIV/SHIV infection results in a substantial increase in the population of CXCR5+ NK cells within the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). These CXCR5+ NK cells display enhanced functional characteristics, including elevated expression of activation markers and increased cytokine production, which are essential for effective viral control. These follicular NK cells are shown to be enriched in IL-15 signaling, and CXCR5 NK cells are negatively associated with viral burden during chronic HIV and SHIV infection.


SUMMARY
The distinct phenotypic and functional attributes of CXCR5+ NK cells, particularly in the lymphoid tissues of individuals living with HIV, emphasize their critical contribution to the anti-HIV-1 immune response. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and roles of CXCR5+ NK cells may present novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing NK-mediated viral control.">

        <tr id="Given the limited comprehensive data on the bone marrow (BM) immune environment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we analyzed the distribution and phenotype of T cell subsets, including γδ T cells, and their immune checkpoint (IC) ligands on blasts. We performed multiparametric flow cytometry with BM samples taken from 89 AML patients at the time of diagnosis, remission, and relapse/refractory status after chemotherapy and 13 healthy controls (HCs) to identify immune-related risk factors. Compared to the HCs, the T cells of the AML patients exhibited exhausted features including higher TIGIT levels and similar levels of PD-1 and TIM-3. The γδ T cells were exhausted by the upregulation of TIGIT and/or TIM-3 and downregulation of NKG2D and NKp30, with different patterns in the Vδ1 and Vδ2 subtypes. A successful chemotherapeutic response partially restored the exhausted phenotypes of the T cell subsets. The simultaneous analysis of IC receptors on the T cell subsets and their ligands on blasts showed the prognostic value of a specific IC receptor–ligand pair and the feasibility of risk stratification based on their diverse patterns. Our findings clarified the BM T cell landscape in AML, unveiling the prognostic value of γδ T cells in both diagnosis and remission predictions.">

        <tr id="Tissue repair and regeneration are essential processes that restore tissue structure and function after injury. The immune system plays a critical role in orchestrating these processes, regulating inflammation, clearing debris, and promoting tissue regeneration through complex interactions with tissue-specific stem cells and resident immune cells. Key immune players, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells, coordinate the early inflammatory phase, while macrophages, particularly M2-polarized macrophages, facilitate tissue repair by secreting growth factors like **VEGF** and **TGF-β**. The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is crucial for proper healing; dysregulated immune activity can lead to chronic wounds, fibrosis, or autoimmune-related tissue damage. In conditions like chronic wounds or liver fibrosis, prolonged inflammation hinders the repair process, emphasizing the need for controlled immune responses. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune activity, including the use of stem cells, immune-modulatory drugs, and biomaterials, hold promise in enhancing tissue repair and regeneration. This review highlights the key roles of immune cells in tissue repair, the impact of immune dysregulation on healing, and the therapeutic potential of targeting immune pathways to improve regenerative outcomes. Understanding the immune mechanisms behind tissue repair opens new avenues for treating chronic diseases and promoting tissue regeneration in clinical settings.

        <tr id="T cell immune tolerance is established in part through the activity of the Auto-immune Regulator (AIRE) transcription factor in the medullary Thymic Epithelial Cells (mTEC) of the thymus. AIRE induces expression of SELF peripheral tissue-specific antigens for presentation to naïve T cells to promote activation/deletion of potentially autoreactive T cells. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that tumors mimic the role of AIRE in mTEC to evade immune rejection. Thus, by expressing a broad range of SELF epitopes against which minimal functional T cell reactivities exist because of thymic deletion, AIRE acts as a master controller of SELFNESS, effectively cloaking the tumor from T cell attack. Moreover, we describe a completely novel immunotherapy in which engineered changes in AIRE expression in tumor cells alters their profile of SELFNESS, exposing both AIRE-modified, and parental unmodified, tumor cells to T cell attack. Consistent with our studies, patient RNAseq shows expression of AIRE predicts response to immune therapies with a strong correlation between AIRE expression and markers of TCR signaling. Therefore, by re-setting the immunological SELFNESS of cancer cells, this novel AIRE-mediated immunotherapy 1). converts a highly tolerized T cell compartment into a heteroclitic tumor-reactive T cell population; 2) confers de novo sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade upon non-immunogenic tumors; 3). completely removes the need to identify potentially immunogenic tumor-associated antigens as targets for generation of de novo CD8+ and helper CD4+ T cell responses; and 4) leads to potent T cell-mediated rejection of aggressive, immunologically cold, non-immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="Identifying definitive biomarkers that predict clinical response and resistance to immunotherapy remains a critical challenge. One emerging factor is extracellular acidosis in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which significantly impairs immune cell function and contributes to immunotherapy failure. However, acidic conditions in the TME disrupt the interaction between cancer and immune cells, driving tumor-infiltrating T cells and NK cells into an inactivated, anergic state. Simultaneously, acidosis promotes the recruitment and activation of immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Notably, tumor acidity enhances exosome release from Tregs, further amplifying immunosuppression. Tumor acidity thus acts as a “protective shield,” neutralizing anti-tumor immune responses and transforming immune cells into pro-tumor allies. Therefore, targeting lactate metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome this barrier, with approaches including buffer agents to neutralize acidic pH and inhibitors to block lactate production or transport, thereby restoring immune cell efficacy in the TME. Recent discoveries have identified genes involved in extracellular pH (pHe) regulation, presenting new therapeutic targets. Moreover, ongoing research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving extracellular acidification and to develop treatments that modulate pH levels to enhance immunotherapy outcomes. Additionally, future clinical studies are crucial to validate the safety and efficacy of pHe-targeted therapies in cancer patients. Thus, this review explores the regulation of pHe in the TME and its potential role in improving cancer immunotherapy.">

Here, we studied three patients from two families with functional hyposplenism, absence of tonsils, and complete lymph node aplasia, leading to recurrent bacterial and viral infections. We identified biallelic loss-of-function mutations in LTBR, encoding the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR), primarily expressed on stromal cells. Patients with LTβR deficiency had hypogammaglobulinemia, diminished memory B cells, regulatory and follicular T helper cells, and dysregulated expression of several tumor necrosis factor family members. B cell differentiation in an ex vivo coculture system was intact, implying that the observed B cell defects were not intrinsic in nature and instead resulted from LTβR-dependent stromal cell interaction signaling critical for SLO formation. Collectively, we define a human inborn error of immunity caused primarily by a stromal defect affecting the development and function of SLOs.">

        <tr id="The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating anticancer immunity, significantly impacting the effectiveness of various cancer therapies, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Its impact on the development of cancer is complex; certain bacteria, like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis, can stimulate the growth of tumors by causing immunological evasion and inflammation, while advantageous strains, like Faecalibaculum rodentium, have the ability to suppress tumors by modifying immune responses. Cytokine activity and immune system regulation are intimately related. Cytokines including TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 promote tumor development by inhibiting efficient immune surveillance. The gut microbiome exhibits a delicate balance between pro- and anti-tumorigenic factors, as evidenced by the enhancement of anti-tumor immunity by cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-γ. Improved immunotherapy responses are linked to a diverse microbiota, which is correlated with higher tumor infiltration and cytotoxic T-cell activation. Because microbial metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, affect cytokine expression and immune cell activation inside the tumor microenvironment, this link highlights the need to maintain microbial balance for optimal treatment effects. Additionally, through stimulating T-cell activation, bacteria like Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum increase cytokine production and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). An option for overcoming ICI resistance is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), since research suggests that it improves melanoma outcomes by increasing CD8+ T-cell activation. This complex interaction provides an opportunity for novel cancer therapies by highlighting the possibility of microbiome modification as a therapeutic approach in personalized oncology approaches.">

 Increased extracellular DNA (exDNA) levels in the blood are a hallmark of metastatic cancer, arising from tumor lysis, apoptosis, necrosis, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by tumor-expanded neutrophils. NETs, web-like chromatin structures extruded by neutrophils to trap pathogens, are highly immunogenic due to their DNA and histone content and their persistent interaction with dendritic cells. Tumor cells can also release extracellular traps. In myeloid leukemia, blasts release nuclear content via traps to activate coagulation or sustain myeloproliferation. Extracellular traps have been found in NPM1 mutant AML patients, with mutant NPM co-localizing with histones along exDNA traps. Forcing trap extrusion in NPM mutant leukemia cells has been used to create dendritic cell-based vaccines that break tolerance against NPMc antigens. This suggests that NETs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may promote tolerance, with breaking tolerance requiring consistent NET formation and dendritic cell interaction. NETs are also seen in solid tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where they aid in cancer cell migration, invasion, and awakening of circulating tumor cells. However, the capacity of tumor cells to directly extrude DNA traps is not fully understood. To investigate this, various human and murine breast cancer cell lines were seeded on poly-D-lysine coated slides, stained with DAPI and Sytoxgreen, and observed via confocal microscopy. Tumor cells extruded DNA traps within 4 hours without stimuli. Notably, trap extrusion correlated with cell line aggressiveness and was abolished by DNase, indicating dsDNA composition. The absence of traps in 24-hour cultures suggests DNA extrusion may help rare tumor cells survive and proliferate. In line, DNase treatment reduced tumor proliferation and increased apoptosis. To assess the significance of DNA traps in vivo, BALB/c mice were injected with the highly metastatic 4T1 clone 5 breast cancer model, with or without DNase treatment, and monitored starting 5 days post-injection and weekly until day 28. Histological analysis at the injection site 5 days post-injection showed that DNase treatment reduced both local trap formation and tumor cell proliferation, as indicated by BrdU incorporation. Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that in DNase-treated mice, initial tumor growth was followed by complete tumor regression, accompanied by local and systemic CD8 T cell activation. Correspondingly, although a few metastases were detectable at day 14 in DNase-treated mice, no metastases were observed by day 28. Although it remains unclear whether tumor-derived or immune cell-derived traps are most relevant in our model, the results demonstrate that their presence in the TME promotes tolerance despite the inherent immune adjuvant properties of the traps. This suggests that DNase treatment could be particularly effective in combating early tumor development or relapse when used as part of a combination therapy designed to sustain anti-tumor immune responses.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cell tumor infiltration is associated with good prognosis in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). NK cells recognize and kill targets by a process called natural cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that promoting an antigen-specific synapse with co-activation may enhance NK cell function in mCRPC. We describe a Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE) construct that engages with the activating receptor CD16 on NK cells, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on mCRPC cells, and has an interleukin (IL)-15 moiety that is essential for NK cell survival, proliferation, and priming. We show that the PSMA TriKE specifically binds to PSMA-expressing cells and significantly enhances expansion, degranulation and cytokine production of NK cells derived from healthy donors or prostate cancer patients. Bystander killing of PSMA-negative was also achieved with PSMA TriKE treatment when co-cultured with PSMA-positive cells, suggesting potential PSMA TriKE benefit in controlling tumor antigen escape. When tested under physiologic conditions recapitulating the mCRPC tumor microenvironment (TME), NK cells treated with PSMA TriKE and prolonged exposure to hypoxia or MDSCs maintained their potent function while IL-15 treated NK cells showed greatly impaired cytotoxicity. Finally, in vivo testing of PSMA TriKE showed improved tumor control and survival of mice as compared to IL-15 and untreated control groups. In conclusion, PSMA TriKE demonstrates potential as a new therapy for advanced prostate cancer by providing additional signals to NK cells to maximize their anti-tumor potential in prostate cancer, especially in the setting of a hostile TME.">

        <tr id="Polyfunctional T cells programmed to perform activities such as degranulation of lytic enzymes and simultaneous production of multiple cytokines are associated with more effective control of viral infections. Immune responses to recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector delivery systems can critically influence therapeutic efficacy and safety of gene therapy. However, knowledge of polyfunctional T cells in anti-AAV immune responses is scarce. To bridge this knowledge gap, we have investigated the polyfunctionality of primary human CD4 T cells from healthy donors after in-vitro exposure to rAAV2 or rAAV9 vectors. By performing proliferation assays of co-cultured T cells and rAAV pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy donors we demonstrate T cell reactivity of 43% and 50% to rAAV2 and rAAV9 vectors, respectively. We validated this frequency in a second screen using another set of healthy donors measuring CD25 and CD71 T cell activation. Single T cell secretome analysis of reactive donors uncovered a Th1 pro-inflammatory, cytolytic and chemoattractive cytokine release profile after stimulation with rAAV2 or rAAV9 vectors. 12.4% and 9.6% of the stimulated T cells displayed a polyfunctional cytokine response, respectively, including elevated polyfunctional inflammatory indices. These responses were characterized by cytokine clusters such as Granzyme B, MIP1-α and TNF-α released in combination by single T cells. Overall, our results provide insights into adaptive immunity with rAAV vector serotypes which will be important in advancing gene therapy safety, vector selection, immunogenicity assessment and better patient selection for AAV gene therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cell-based immunotherapies including immune checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptor T cells can induce durable responses in patients with cancer. However, clinical efficacy is limited due to the ability of cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. While T cells have been the primary focus of immunotherapy, recent research has highlighted the importance of natural killer (NK) cells in directly recognizing and eliminating tumor cells and playing a key role in the set-up of an effective adaptive immune response. The remarkable potential of NK cells for cancer immunotherapy is demonstrated by their ability to broadly identify stressed cells, irrespective of the presence of neoantigens, and their ability to fight tumors that have lost their major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) expression due to acquired resistance mechanisms. However, like T cells, NK cells can become dysfunctional within the tumor microenvironment. Strategies to enhance and reinvigorate NK cell activity hold potential for bolstering cancer immunotherapy. Methods In this study, we conducted a high-throughput screen to identify molecules that could enhance primary human NK cell function. After compound validation, we investigated the effect of the top performing compounds on dysfunctional NK cells that were generated by a newly developed in vitro platform. Functional activity of NK cells was investigated using compounds alone and in combination with checkpoint inhibitor blockade. The findings were validated on patient-derived intratumoral dysfunctional NK cells from different cancer types. Results The screening approach led to the identification of a Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl-b) inhibitor enhancing the activity of primary human NK cells. Furthermore, the Cbl-b inhibitor was able to reinvigorate the activity of in vitro generated and patient-derived dysfunctional NK cells. Finally, Cbl-b inhibition combined with T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) blockade further increased the cytotoxic potential and reinvigoration of both in vitro generated and patient-derived intratumoral dysfunctional NK cells. Conclusions These findings underscore the relevance of Cbl-b inhibition in overcoming NK cell dysfunctionality with the potential to complement existing immunotherapies and improve outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is a progressive pathology deleteriously impacting cancer survivorship. CXCL12 is an immune-stromal signal implicated in fibrosis and innate response. We hypothesised that modulation of CXCL12 would phenotypically mitigate RIF. CXCL12 expression was characterised in a rodent model of RIF and its expression modulated by the intravascular delivery of lentiviral vectors encoding small hairpin RNA to silence (LVShCXCL12) or overexpress (LVOeCXCL12) CXCL12. Multi-modal fibrotic outcomes were quantified, flow cytometry and Y-chromosome lineage-tracking studies performed to examine cellular recruitment and activation post-radiotherapy (post-RT). Whole-tissue RNA-seq was used to examine matrisomal response. MATBIII tumours were engrafted within tissues with differing levels of CXCL12 expression and tumoral response to RT evaluated. CXCL12 was upregulated in irradiated fibroblasts demonstrating DNA-damage post-RT and led to the recruitment of CD68+ macrophages. Silencing Cxcl12 with LVShCXCL12 demonstrated reduced RIF phenotype as a result of decreased macrophage recruitment. Transcriptomic profiling identified osteopontin (SPP1) as being highly differentially expressed in LVShCXCL12-treated tissues. Tumours growing in tissues devoid of CXCL12 expression responded better following RT due to reductions in peri-tumoural fibrosis as a result of decreased CXCL12 and OPN expression at the tumour/normal tissue interface. This was also associated with greater CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumours with less fibrosis. Antibody-mediated OPN blockade slowed tumour growth by increased intra-tumoral CD8+ T cell activation. The CXCL12/OPN axis is an important node of immune/matrisomal cross-talk in the development of fibrosis. Therapeutic manipulation of this axis may offer greater anti-tumour efficacy whilst also reducing adverse effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) has become a dominant regimen in modern cancer therapy, however immune resistance induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with immune suppressive and evasion properties limits responses. Therefore, the rational design of immune modulators that can control the immune suppressive properties of TAMs and polarize them, as well as dendritic cells (DCs), toward a more proinflammatory phenotype is a principal objective in cancer immunotherapy. Methods Here, using a protein engineering approach to enhance cytokine residence in the tumor microenvironment, we examined combined stimulation of the myeloid compartment via tumor stroma-binding granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to enhance responses in both DCs and T cells via stroma-binding interleukin-12 (IL-12). We evaluated tumor responses at the levels of outcome, cellular responses, and cytokine responses in both the tumors and the tumor-draining lymph nodes. We further investigated the potentiation of DC response to IL-12 by GM-CSF stimulation ex vivo. Results Engineered GM-CSF restored an antitumorigenic tumor myeloid microenvironment otherwise suppressed by TAMs, while engineered IL-12 provided effector signals to T cells, thereby boosting both tumor-resident antitumor macrophage and CD8+ T cell populations. Furthermore, engineered GM-CSF potentiated DC response to IL-12, upregulating DC expression of IL-12 receptor and enhancing their expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines on IL-12 exposure. This resulted in remarkable synergistic efficacy in multiple solid tumor models treated with the dual cytokine combination. The combination therapy also improved the efficacy of CPI in a CPI-resistant genetically-engineered melanoma model and exhibited synergistic antitumor efficacy in a pulmonary metastasis model.

        <tr id="Numerous human cancers have exhibited the ability to elude immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This type of resistance can be mediated by immune-suppressive macrophages that limit antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we elucidate a strategy to shift macrophages into a proinflammatory state that down-regulates V domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) via inhibiting AhR and IRAK1. We used a high-throughput microfluidic platform combined with a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of VISTA levels. Functional characterization showed that the knockdown of these hits diminished VISTA surface levels on macrophages and sustained an antitumor phenotype. Furthermore, targeting of both AhR and IRAK1 in mouse models overcame resistance to ICB treatment. Tumor immunophenotyping indicated that infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ cells, natural killer cells, and antitumor macrophages was substantially increased in treated mice. Collectively, AhR and IRAK1 are implicated as regulators of VISTA that coordinate a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses.">

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the key component of tumor microenvironment, which play a pivotal role in tumor immune escape by regulating the immunity checkpoints, inhibiting the activity of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and modulating proportion of different T cells. Stanniocalcin-1(STC1)is ubiquitously expressed in human body, which is proven to involve with tumor progression and clinical prognosis. Recently, STC1 is implicated in tumor microenvironment as a phagocytosis checkpoint, as well as regulates the immunity via macrophages. In the review, we discussed the role of STC1 and TAMs in tumor immunity and their crosstalk, hoping to provide references for the research of STC1 in tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment which is a main barrier for immunotherapies of solid cancers. Reducing Treg numbers enhances anti-tumor immune responses but current depletion strategies also impair effector T cells (Teffs), potentially leading to reduced anti-tumor immunity and/or autoimmune diseases. CD137 has been identified as the most differentially expressed gene between peripheral Tregs and intratumoral Tregs in virtually all solid cancers. Further, CD137 is expressed by malignant cells of certain cancers, making it a potential target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we report the development of a fully human anti-human CD137 antibody of the IgG1 isotype, clone P1A1, that induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. P1A1 cross-reacts with murine CD137 which allowed testing murine chimeric P1A1 in syngeneic murine tumor models where P1A1 significantly reduced the number of CD137+ Tregs and inhibited tumor growth in a murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a melanoma lung metastasis model. P1A1 can also be internalized thus enabling it as a carrier for drugs to target CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. These anti-cancer properties suggest a translation of P1A1 to human immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells contribute to antitumor immunity and are implicated in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. In particular, CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells were recently found to block spontaneous breast carcinogenesis. However, the antitumor potential of Th2 cells in targeting established breast cancer remains uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate that Th2 cells induced by the topical calcipotriol/thymic stromal lymphopoietin cytokine axis suppressed the growth of established mammary tumors in mice. Interleukin-24 (IL-24), an anticancer cytokine, was highly upregulated in macrophages infiltrating calcipotriol-treated mammary tumors. Macrophages expressed IL-24 in response to IL-4 signaling in combination with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists (e.g., HMGB1) in vitro. Calcipotriol treatment significantly increased HMGB1 release by tumor cells in vivo. CD4+ T cell depletion reduced HMGB1 and IL-24 expression, reversing calcipotriol’s therapeutic efficacy. Macrophage depletion and TLR4 inhibition also reduced the therapeutic efficacy of calcipotriol. Importantly, calcipotriol treatment failed to control mammary tumors lacking the IL-24 receptor on tumor cells. Collectively, our findings reveal that Th2 cell–macrophage crosstalk leads to IL-24–mediated tumor cell death, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy to tackle breast cancer.">

 Cancer immunotherapy (including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)) has shown great promise in the treatment of some solid cancers, but responses in breast cancer patients are limited. While breast cancer is generally considered poorly immunogenic, the abundance of CD8+ T cells correlates with clinical response. CD8+ T cells are critical mediators of anti-tumor immunity and the main target for ICB. However, the onset of terminal functional T cell exhaustion poses a major challenge. Although T cell exhaustion has been linked to persistent antigen exposure, it remains unclear how the immune composition of the breast tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to this dysfunctional T cell state. Breast cancers are heavily infiltrated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and their abundance correlates with T cell exhaustion and poor prognosis. Previously, we discovered a spatiotemporal co-dependency between exhausted T cells (TEX) and TAMs in mouse models of melanoma and breast cancer. We showed that TEX actively recruit monocytes to the TME and shape their differentiation trajectory into TAMs. Reciprocally, these TAMs ‘capture’ T cells in long-lived synaptic interactions that contribute to functional T cell exhaustion. Our current work is focused on studying the TEX-derived chemokines that regulate these TAM – T cell interactions in the breast TME with the ultimate goal to alleviate immune evasion and improve responsiveness of breast cancer to immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are innate immune cells that exert far reaching influence over the tumor microenvironment (TME). Depending on cues within the local environment, TAMs may promote tumor angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion and immunosuppression, or, alternatively, inhibit tumor progression via neoantigen presentation, tumoricidal reactive oxygen species generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Therefore, TAMs have a pivotal role in determining tumor progression and response to therapy. TAM phenotypes are driven by cytokines and physical cues produced by tumor cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, immune cells, and other cells within the TME. Research has shown that TAMs can be primed by environmental stimuli, adding another layer of complexity to the environmental context that determines TAM phenotype. Innate priming is a functional consequence of metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of innate cells by a primary stimulant, resulting in altered cellular response to future secondary stimulation. Innate priming offers a novel target for development of cancer immunotherapy and improved prognosis of disease, but also raises the risk of exacerbating existing inflammatory pathologies. This review will discuss the mechanisms underlying innate priming including metabolic and epigenetic modification, its relevance to TAMs and tumor progression, and possible clinical implications for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Severe lower respiratory tract disease following influenza A virus (IAV) infection is characterized by excessive inflammation and lung tissue damage, and this can impair lung function. The effect of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which detects viral RNA to initiate antiviral and proinflammatory responses to IAV, on lung function during peak infection and in the resolution phase is not fully understood. Using wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice, we found that IAV infection induced airway dysfunction in both genotypes, although in TLR7 KO mice, this dysfunction manifested later, did not affect lung tissue elastance and damping, and was associated with a different immune phenotype. A positive correlation was found between lung dysfunction and the infiltration of neutrophils and Ly6Clo patrolling monocytes at day 7 post-infection. Conversely, in TLR7 KO mice, eosinophil and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were associated with airway hyperactivity at day 14. IL-5 expression was higher in the airways of IAV-infected TLR7 KO mice, suggesting an enhanced Th2 response due to TLR7 deficiency. This study highlights an underappreciated duality of TLR7 in IAV disease: promoting inflammation-driven lung dysfunction during the acute infection but suppressing eosinophilic and CD8+ T cell-dependent hyperresponsiveness during disease resolution.">

        <tr id="Elevated levels of serum autoantibodies are a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are produced by plasma cells in response to a variety of antigenic triggers. In SLE, the triggers are complex and may include both T cell-dependent/-independent and TLR-dependent/-independent mechanisms of immune activation, which ultimately contributes to the significant immune dysregulation seen in patients at the level of cytokine production and cellular activation (B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils and macrophages). Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) has been identified as an autoimmune susceptibility gene and polymorphisms in IRF5 associate with altered expression and hyper-activation in distinct SLE immune cell subsets. To gain further insight into the mechanisms that drive IRF5-mediated SLE immune activation, we characterised wild-type (WT) and Irf5-/- Balb/c mice in response to immunisation. WT and Irf5-/- Balb/c mice were immunised to activate various signalling pathways in vivo followed by systemic immunophenotyping and detection of antibody production by multi-colour flow cytometry and ELISPOT. We identified two pathways, TLR9-dependent and T cell-dependent that resulted in IRF5 cell type-specific function. Immunisation with either CpG-B + Alum or NP-KLH + Alum but not with R848 + Alum, NP-LPS + Alum or NP-Ficoll+Alum resulted in decreased plasma cell generation and reduced antibody production in Irf5-/- mice. Notably, the mechanism(s) leading to this downstream phenotype was distinct. In CpG-B + Alum immunised mice, we found reduced activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, resulting in reduced IFNα and IL6 production in Irf5-/- mice. Conversely, mice immunised with NP-KLH + Alum had reduced numbers of T follicular helper cells and germinal centre B cells with reduced expression of Bcl6 in Irf5-/- mice. Moreover, T follicular helper cells from Irf5-/- mice were functionally defective. Even though the downstream phenotype of reduced antibody production in Irf5-/- mice was conserved between T cell-dependent and TLR9-dependent immunisation, the mechanisms leading to this phenotype were antigen- and cell type-specific.">

 Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are generally unresponsive to tumor targeted and immunotherapies. Whether genetic alterations acquired during the evolution of CRPC impact immune and immunotherapy responses is largely unknown. Using our innovative electroporation-based mouse models, we generated distinct genetic subtypes of CRPC found in patients and uncovered unique immune microenvironments. Specifically, mouse and human prostate tumors with MYC amplification and p53 disruption had weak cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration and an overall dismal prognosis. MYC and p53 cooperated to induce tumor intrinsic secretion of VEGF, which by signaling through VEGFR2 expressed on CD8+ T cells, could directly inhibit T cell activity. Targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling in vivo led to CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor and metastasis growth suppression and significantly increased overall survival in MYC and p53 altered CPRC. VEGFR2 blockade also led to induction of PD-L1, and in combination with PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade produced anti-tumor efficacy in multiple preclinical CRPC mouse models. Thus, our results identify a genetic mechanism of immune suppression through VEGF signaling in prostate cancer that can be targeted to reactivate immune and immunotherapy responses in an aggressive subtype of CRPC.

The supernatants from split-anergized NK cells (IL-2 and anti-CD16 mAb-treated NK cells) induced differentiation in hA549. Differentiated lung cancer cell line (H292) and NK cells differentiated hA549 expressed reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity but expressed higher sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. This finding validated our previous reports demonstrating that the levels of tumor killing by NK cells and by chemotherapeutic drugs correlate directly and indirectly, respectively, with the stage and levels of tumor differentiation. We also demonstrate the role of IFN-γ and TNF-α in inducing tumor differentiation. NK cells’ supernatants or IFN-γ and TNF-α-induced tumor differentiation was blocked when we used antibodies against IFN-γ and TNF-α. Therefore, IFN-γ and TNF-α released from NK cells play a significant role in differentiating tumors, resulting in increased susceptibility of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs. We also observed the different effects of MHC-class I antibodies in CSCs vs. differentiated tumors. Treatment with anti-MHC-class I decreased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in hA549 tumors, whereas it increased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity when differentiated tumors were treated with antibodies against MHC-class I.">

        <tr id="Background. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of malignant blood diseases with a high risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. One treatment approach is to target immune checkpoints (ICs) that are overexpressed on tumor cells. To develop these drugs, relevant models are needed for highthroughput screening and study of these biologically active substances, since traditionally used models (mouse and patient biomaterials) are difficult to access, financially and laborintensive, and are characterized by poorly reproducible results.Aim. To develop a model based on a human myeloid cell line with increased expression of L1 and TIM3 to study the activity of ICs inhibitors, the presence of which in the tumor microenvironment in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia was associated with a high risk and worse prognosis.Materials and methods. Initial testing of the L1 and TIM3 basal expression level was carried out on cell lines: TH1, HL60, OCIAML2, OCIAML5, KG1, MonoMac1. Induction of IC expression was carried out using interferon γ. Analysis of marker expression was carried out 24 hours after induction of ICs expression and addition of MK2206 using flow cytometry.Results. Basal expression of the studied ICs receptors was absent in all of them, except for KG1; TIM3 was present in 88.4 ± 7.1 % of cells, and L1 – in 88 ± 8.5 %. The addition of interferon γ at a concentration of 50 ng/mL to the MonoMac1 culture led to a significant increase in the proportion of TIM3 and L1 expressing cells (53.3 ± 12.2 and 97.3 ± 1.1 % respectively, compared to 0.1 ± 0.1 and 0.1 ± 0.1 % without interferon γ), and for TH1 only L1 expression (87.5 ± 20 %, control 0.1 ± 0.1 %) was observed at the concentration of interferon γ in a medium of 50 ng/mL, while the proportion of cells expressing TIM3 was 6.9 ± 10 % (control 0.1 ± 0.1 %).Conclusion. The KG1 line, which constantly expresses significant levels of target ICs, as well as TH1 and MonoMac1, which are induced by 50 ng/mL interferon γ, were selected as a model with increased L1 and TIM3 expression based on a human myeloid cell line. The model efficiency was confirmed by the rational response to the IC pathway inhibitor.">

        <tr id="Introduction Anandamide (AEA) is an endocannabinoid that has recently been recognized as a regulator of various inflammatory diseases as well as cancer. While AEA was thought to predominantly engage cannabinoid (CB) receptors, recent findings suggest that, given its protective anti-inflammatory role in pathological conditions, anandamide may engage not only CB receptors. Methods In this study, we studied the role of exogenous AEA in a mouse AirPouch model of acute inflammation by examining immune cell infiltrates by flow cytometry. Human primary immune cells were used to validate findings towards immune cell activation and migration by flow cytometry and bead-based ELISA. Results We found that AEA decreases the acute infiltration of myeloid cells including granulocytes and monocytes into the inflamed area, but unexpectedly increases the number of T cells at the site of inflammation. This was related to AEA signaling through nuclear receptor subfamily 4A (NR4A) transcription factors rather than CB receptors. Exploring regulatory mechanisms in the human system, we found that AEA broadly inhibits the migratory capacity of immune cells, arguing for blocked emigration of T cells from the inflamed tissue. Taking a closer look at the impact of AEA on T cells revealed that AEA profoundly alters the activation and exhaustion status of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, thereby strongly inhibiting TH17 responses, while not altering TH1 differentiation. Discussion These data suggest that AEA has the potential to block chronic inflammation without influencing crucial anti-viral and anti-microbial immune defense mechanisms, and may therefore be an attractive molecule to interfere with the establishment of chronic inflammation.">

 Background: The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly organized non-cellular network consisting of structural proteins, growth factors, cytokines and other secreted molecules. The ECM is highly dynamic and is a critical player in the regulation of local invasion and metastasis. The ECM network is ever-changing and an important immunosuppressive component of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the reciprocal effects of the immune system on the tumor-associated ECM are elusive and largely unexplored. Regulatory T (Treg) cells function to enforce peripheral tolerance and are potent suppressors of tumor immunity. We have previously shown that Treg cells promote tumor growth in murine breast cancer models by favoring alternative activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via suppression of IFN-g. Aims: In this work, we sought to assess whether Treg cell-mediated immune suppression is associated with changes in the ECM, and whether those ECM changes functionally impact metastatic dissemination. Further, we assessed the requirement of TAMs and IFN-g in the ECM remodeling. Design Methods: In this study, we used spontaneous and transplantable models of breast cancer susceptible to genetic ablation of Treg cells. We used a combination of histopathological analysis, tumor decellularization, bioengineering 3D-chip modeling, in vivo manipulations and bioinformatic analysis, to evaluate remodeling of the ECM, cancer cell invasive behavior and metastatic dissemination. Results Summary: Treg cell ablation resulted in significant ECM remodeling, with reduced amounts and organization of collagen fibers, and increased amounts of fibronectin and laminin. Tumor cells seeding on Treg cell ablated tumor- derived decellularized ECM matrices results in reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors, and profound impairment of collective migration. In vivo, Treg cell ablation in a neo-adjuvant setting followed by primary tumor resection resulted in significant reduction of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and impairment of lung metastatic disease. Importantly, we demonstrated that Treg cell ablation-driven changes in the matrisome correlate with long-term improved survival in a cohort of breast cancer patient samples. Through genetic knock-out models and in-vivo neutralization, we observed that Treg cell-dependent changes in ECM-related phenotypes are dependent on IFN-g-signaling. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of murine breast tumors revealed that the matrisome signature is highly upregulated among TAMs, compared to other TME cell types. Lastly, using conditional genetic knock-out models we show these IFN-g-dependent changes are mostly driven by TAMs. Conclusions: Altogether, we identified a novel metastasis-promoting effect of Treg cells in the breast cancer microenvironment through regulation of ECM dynamics beyond their described effects on primary tumor growth.

        <tr id="Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread mosquito-borne virus, which can cause dengue fever with mild symptoms, or progress to fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. As the main target cells of DENV, macrophages are responsible for the innate immune response against the virus. Methods: In this study, we investigated the role of pyroptosis in the pathogenic mechanism of dengue fever by examining the level of pyroptosis in DENV-1-infected macrophages and further screened differentially expressed microRNAs by high-throughput sequencing to predict microRNAs that could affect the pyroptosis of the macrophage. Results: Macrophages infected with DENV-1 were induced with decreased cell viability, decreased release of lactate dehydrogenase and IL-1β, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, cleavage of GSDMD to produce an N-terminal fragment bound to cell membrane, and finally induced macrophage pyroptosis. MicroRNA expression profiles were obtained by sequencing macrophages from all periods of DENV-1 infection and comparing with the negative control. Sixty-three microRNAs differentially expressed in both the early and later stages of infection were also identified. In particular, miR-223-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-146a-5p and miR-34a-5p were recognized as small molecules that may be involved in the regulation of inflammation. Conclusions: In summary, this study aimed to understand the pathogenic mechanism of DENV through relevant molecular mechanisms and provide new targets for dengue-specific therapy.">

This article provides step-by- step procedure description and results based on in vivo studies on murine lung tissue, cell of interest isolation with dual protocols for flow cytometry method as well as IL-33 impact in dynamics. The newly described innate lymphoid cells of group 2 (ILC2) play an important role in type 2 immune reactions, epithelial repair in mucosal tissue and metabolic homeostasis. ILC2 releases large amounts of type 2 cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13, which stimulate type 2 immunity, such as protection against worms. However, without strict regulation, the level of ILC2 can cause undesirable type 2 immune pathologies, including allergic inflammation of the respiratory tract, hypersensitivity of the respiratory tract and atopic dermatitis. Viral infections of the respiratory tract, which are typical triggers of type 1 immune reactions, often lead to type 2 pulmonary immune pathologies, such as asthma and its exacerbations. Interestingly, pulmonary virus infections induce the release of IL-33 with subsequent induction of ILC2-mediated type 2 pulmonary immunopathology, which is independent of the adaptive immune system.">

        <tr id="Continuous vaso-occlusive and inflammatory processes cause extensive end-organ damage in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), and there is little evidence that longterm hydroxyurea therapy prevents this. In initial trials, P-selectin blockade with crizanlizumab reduced SCD vaso-occlusive crisis frequency, and interleukin (IL)-1β inhibition in SCD patients, using canakinumab, lowered inflammatory markers. We used murine SCD models to examine the effects of acute and chronic blockade of Pselectin and of IL-1β on vaso-occlusive events, their inflammatory profile and organ health. Both approaches improved impaired cutaneous microvascular perfusion in SCD mice by reducing TNF-α-induced vaso-occlusion. Acute P-selectin blockade markedly reduced TNF-α-induced neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation in SCD mice, and decreased leukocyte-rolling movements in the microvasculature, while acute IL-1β inhibition attenuated microvascular leukocyte adhesion. Six weeks of IL-1β-blocking immunotherapy improved the inflammatory profile of SCD mice, considerably reduced hepatic fibrosis and provided some relief from lung injury. In contrast, although Pselectin blockade reduced glomerular congestion, no significant benefit to overall organ pathology was observed. Unexpectedly, while combining the two immunotherapies reduced microvascular occlusion, their prolonged use caused acute liver injury. Notably, inhibition of IL-1β, but not of P-selectin, remarkably decreased hemosiderosis, in association with reduced tissue macrophage infiltration and the correction of biomarkers of dysregulated iron turnover. Our findings suggest that the attenuation of inflammation, as well as of vaso-occlusive processes, may be crucial for mitigating organ damage in SCD. Future trials should explore the ability of cytokine blockade to prevent multiorgan damage in patients with SCD, beyond evaluating vaso-occlusive crisis frequency.">

        <tr id="The term cancer immunoediting describes the dual role by which the immune system can suppress and promote tumour growth and is divided into three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. The role of NK cells has mainly been attributed to the elimination phase. Here we show that NK cells play a role in all three phases of cancer immunoediting. Extended co-culturing of DNA barcoded mouse BCR/ABLp185+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) cells with NK cells allowed for a quantitative measure of NK cell-mediated immunoediting. Although most tumour cell clones were efficiently eliminated by NK cells, a certain fraction of tumour cells harboured an intrinsic primary resistance. Furthermore, DNA barcoding revealed tumour cell clones with secondary resistance, which stochastically acquired resistance to NK cells. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity put a selective pressure on B-ALL cells, which led to an outgrowth of primary and secondary resistant tumour cell clones, which were characterised by an IFN-γ signature. Besides well-known regulators of immune evasion, our analysis of NK cell-resistant tumour cells revealed the upregulation of genes, including Ly6a, which we found to promote leukaemic-cell resistance to NK cells. Translation of our findings to the human system showed that high expression of LY6E on tumour cells impaired their physical interaction with NK cells and led to worse prognosis in leukaemia patients. Our results demonstrate that tumour cells are actively edited by NK cells during the equilibrium phase and use different avenues to escape NK cell-mediated eradication.">

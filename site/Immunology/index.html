        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Somatic mutations inactivating TET2 are among the most common drivers of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). While TET2 inactivation is associated with monocyte-derived inflammation and improved chimeric antigen-receptor-T cell function, its impact on immunotherapy response is unknown. In our mouse model, hematopoietic Tet2 mutation enhanced immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. Enhanced ICB response with Tet2 mutation required phagocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, in Tet2-mutant tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), ICB preferentially induced anti-tumor states and restricted cell states linked to tumor progression. Tet2-mutant monocytes activated costimulatory programs, while Tet2-mutant T cells showed enhanced T cell memory signatures, lesser exhaustion and decreased regulatory phenotype. Our murine data was clinically relevant, since we found that melanomas from patients with TET2 driver mutation-CH (TET2-CH) showed enhanced immune infiltration, T cell activation, and T cell memory programs. In melanoma patients treated with ICB, TET2-CH was associated with 6-fold greater odds of clinical benefit. Collectively, our data establishes that hematopoietic Tet2 inactivation primes leukocytes for anti-tumor states associated with immunotherapy response and provides a potential biomarker for personalized therapy.">

        <tr id="During homeostasis, innate and epithelial cells undergo continuous maturation, shaped by microbial, molecular and cellular interactions. While these cells influence adaptive immunity during steady-state conditions, the reciprocal homeostatic role of adaptive immune cells in the maturation and function of innate and epithelial cells remains underexplored. Here, through computational approaches and murine models, we establish that adaptive immunity shapes innate immune and epithelial homeostatic landscapes. Mechanistically, adaptive immunity acts as a brake on type 1 polarization and diversification of innate lymphocytes (ILCs). Without adaptive immunity, the innate cellular interactions within the mesenteric lymph nodes are dominated by an interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signaling network. Moreover, the innate immune and epithelial cells follow distinct phenotypic and functional trajectories, including ILCs acquiring myeloid markers, monocytes adopting an inflammatory path, and colonic epithelial cells expressing altered antimicrobial peptides and losing Paneth-like features. Depleting ILCs, abolishing IFNγ signaling, or restoring adaptive immunity reduces these IFNγ-driven changes. Thus, our findings highlight a homeostatic function of adaptive immunity in modulating innate and epithelial cell communication, diversity, composition, function, and differentiation, notably by limiting ILC-derived IFNγ.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally acquire immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting phenotypes, which may contribute to tumor resistance to immunotherapy. We previously showed that suppression of microRNA activity through genetic Dicer1 inactivation rewires TAM’s transcriptomes and prompts their immunostimulatory activation. This phenotypic switch enhanced recruitment and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and improved the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse cancer models. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole tumors grown in either wild-type mice or mice with macrophage-specific Dicer1 deletion. The analysis of multiple cell populations, including several discrete monocyte and macrophage subsets, indicated broad and convergent immunostimulatory programming of the tumor microenvironment, which was dependent on CTL-derived interferon-gamma (IFNγ), in mice with DICER-deficient macrophages. Intriguingly, dynamic inferences on monocyte/macrophage ontogeny and differentiation by pseudotime analysis revealed trajectories associated with progression into cell cycle, monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, and transition from an immunostimulatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors with DICER-proficient macrophages. Dicer1 deficiency interfered with this trajectory and stalled TAMs at an intermediate state between immature monocytes and macrophages with T cell-stimulatory capacity, thereby impeding immunosuppressive TAM development. This translated into enhanced response to antiangiogenic immunotherapy in an immunotherapy-resistant model of non-small cell lung cancer. Cycling/M2-like macrophages were conserved in human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and should represent a more promising therapeutic target than the bulk of TAMs.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Understanding the immune mechanisms associated with liver transplantation (LT), particularly the involvement of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs), represents a significant challenge. Methods: This study employs a multi-omics approach to analyse liver transplant samples from both human (n = 17) and mouse (n = 16), utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and immunological techniques. Results: Our findings reveal a comprehensive T cell-centric landscape in LT across human and mouse species, involving 235,116 cells. Notably, we found a substantial increase in CD8+ TRMs within rejected grafts compared to stable ones. The elevated presence of CD8+ TRMs is characterised by a distinct expression profile, featuring upregulation of tissue-residency markers (CD69, CXCR6, CD49A and CD103+/-,), immune checkpoints (PD1, CTLA4, and TIGIT), cytotoxic markers (GZMB and IFNG) and proliferative markers (PCNA and TOP2A) during rejection. Furthermore, there is a high expression of transcription factors such as EOMES and RUNX3. Functional assays and analyses of cellular communication underscore the active role of CD8+ TRMs in interacting with other tissue-resident cells, particularly Kupffer cells, especially during rejection episodes. Conclusions: These insights into the distinctive activation and interaction patterns of CD8+ TRMs suggest their potential utility as biomarkers for graft rejection, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing graft tolerance and improving overall transplant outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The main challenge against patients with cancer to derive benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 appears to be the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), in which IL-33/ST2 signal fulfills critical functions. However, whether IL-33 limits the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 remains uncertain. Methods Molecular mechanisms of IL-33/ST2 signal on anti-PD-L1 treatment lewis lung carcinoma tumor model were assessed by RNA-seq, ELISA, WB and immunofluorescence (IF). A sST2-Fc fusion protein was constructed for targeting IL-33 and combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody for immunotherapy in colon and lung tumor models. On this basis, bifunctional fusion proteins were generated for PD-L1-targeted blocking of IL-33 in tumors. The underlying mechanisms of dual targeting of IL-33 and PD-L1 revealed by RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, FACS, IF and WB. Results After anti-PD-L1 administration, tumor-infiltrating ST2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were elevated. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signal with sST2-Fc fusion protein potentiated antitumor efficacy of PD-L1 antibody by enhancing T cell responses in tumor models. Bifunctional fusion protein anti-PD-L1-sST2 exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy compared with combination therapy, not only inhibited tumor progression and extended the survival, but also provided long-term protective antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the superior antitumor activity of targeting IL-33 and PD-L1 originated from reducing immunosuppressive factors, such as Tregs and exhausted CD8+ T cells while increasing tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that IL-33/ST2 was involved in the immunosuppression mechanism of PD-L1 antibody therapy, and blockade by sST2-Fc or anti-PD-L1-sST2 could remodel the inflammatory TME and induce potent antitumor effect, highlighting the potential therapeutic strategies for the tumor treatment by simultaneously targeting IL-33 and PD-L1.">

Grem1 FRCs co-localize with DCs and express FLT3L in human and mouse lymph nodes. Using a new genetic model, we provide evidence that FLT3L produced by GREM1 FRCs maintains lymph node preDCs, cDCs, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Spatial transcriptomics and cytofluorometry reveal that Grem1 FRC-derived FLT3L supports not only proliferation, but also survival of lymph node cDCs within the interfollicular zone (IFZ). Functionally, loss of Grem1 FRC-derived FLT3L impairs cDC priming of antigen-specific T cell responses.

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

        <tr id="Therapies that harness the immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells have revolutionized cancer care. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumor immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients, yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

In particular, SCA1+ fibroblasts were enriched for numerous chemokines, including CCL2, CCL7, and IL33 compared to SCA1-fibroblasts. Genetic deletion of Ccl2 in fibroblasts resulted in fewer wound bed macrophages and monocytes during injury-induced inflammation with reduced revascularization and re-epithelialization during the proliferation phase of healing.

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

It is therefore important to better understand the relationship between AML cells and immune cells within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, where this disease grows. Here we focus on non-malignant BM macrophages, and using a combination of intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, transcriptomics and functional analyses we identify a subpopulation of immunomodulatory BM macrophages (IMMs) with a unique profile and function during AML progression. While the majority of macrophages are already being lost at early infiltration, IMMs are locally enriched. They are capable of efferocytosis and support AML growth through inhibition of T cells. Enrichment of IMMs in the BM of patients developing early relapse indicates that future development of interventions that target IMMs’ development and function may improve AML patients’ outcome.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

TNFSF13 is a cytokine important for B cell maturation and function, but roles for epithelial TNFSF13 and putative contribution to inflammatory bowel disease are poorly understood. We evaluated functional consequences of a novel monoallelic TNFSF13 variant using biopsies, tissue-derived colonoids and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived colon organoids. TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited a >50% reduction in secreted TNFSF13, increased epithelial proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids. Single cell RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation identified FAS as the predominant colonic epithelial receptor for TNFSF13. Imaging mass cytometry revealed an increase in epithelial-associated B cells in TNFSF13 variant colon tissue sections. Finally, TNFSF13 variant colonoids co-cultured with memory B cells demonstrated a reduction in the production of IgA+ plasma cells compared to control colonoid co-cultures. Our findings support a role for epithelial TNFSF13 as a regulator of colonic epithelial growth and epithelial crosstalk with B cells.

        <tr id="Acquired resistance is a growing obstacle to durable responses after cancer immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The mechanisms by which heterogeneous tumors evolve under immunotherapy pressure and strategies targeting key populations to prevent relapse are poorly understood. We show that chronic interferon (IFN) enables a subpopulation of cancer cells to acquire inflammatory memory and express memory ISGs, a subset of IFN-stimulated genes enriched for immune evasion properties, leading to subclonal epigenetic evolution of ICB-resistant states. Inflammatory memory is epigenetically encoded through chronic virus mimicry – feedforward MDA5 signaling likely activated by endogenous retroelements. While JAK inhibitors can improve ICB response, combining them with TBK1 inhibitors collapses this feedforward mechanism, erasing inflammatory memory and preventing differentiation into resistance states. Across human cancers, small subpopulations of memory ISG-expressing cells are prevalent and coupled to T cell exhaustion, suggesting inflammatory memory may be a common mechanism of acquired resistance targetable by JAK plus TBK1 inhibition.">

        <tr id="Macrophages orchestrate tissue homeostasis and immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

However, their functional characteristics and effect on cellular immunity after surgery have not been comprehensively investigated.

We then screened a small molecule library using our sx-MDSC:NK cell suppression assay to identify compounds that could inhibit sx-MDSCs. These studies provide evidence that PI3K-γ signalling is upregulated in sx-MDSCs and blockade with PI3K-γ specific inhibitors attenuates NK cell suppression in humans and mice and reduces postoperative metastases in murine models. Upregulated PI3K-γ in sx-MDSCs is a potential pathway amenable to therapeutic targeting in the postoperative period.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells suppress cellular and humoral immune responses via killing of T cells, resulting in diminished vaccine responses in mice and humans. Efforts to overcome this roadblock and achieve optimal immunity require an improved understanding of the molecular mediators facilitating NK cell-targeting of discrete subsets of CD4 T cells. We employed single-cell forensic victimology and CRISPR-Cas9 editing to delineate a transcriptional program uniquely responsible for the susceptibility of a subpopulation of CD4 T cells to perforin-dependent immunoregulation by NK cells. The unique vulnerability of these CD4 T cells relative to other subsets of CD4 T cells was not associated with a pattern of NK-cell-receptor ligand expression that would favor activation of NK cells. Instead, susceptible CD4 T cells were skewed toward follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation and exhibited intermediate expression of Klf2 and a related suite of KLF2-target genes (e.g. S1pr1) involved in cell migration and spatial positioning. NK-cell dependent suppression of the subset of Tfh exhibiting intermediate expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 was confirmed with single-cell proteomics. CRISPR targeting of KLF2 in CD4 T cells prevented suppression by NK cells. Thus, KLF2 regulation of spatial positioning of T cells is a key determinant of NK-cell immunoregulatory function and a possible target for strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Dysregulated T-cell immune response-mediated inflammation plays critical roles in the pathology of diverse liver diseases, but the underlying mechanism of liver immune homeostasis control and the specific therapies for limiting T-cell overactivation remain unclear. Methods: The metabolic changes in concanavalin A (ConA) mice and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients and their associations with liver injury were analyzed. The expression of purine catabolism nucleases (e.g., CD39 and CD73) on liver cells and immune cells was assessed. The effects of MCregs and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and the underlying mechanism were also explored. Results: Our findings revealed significant alterations in purine metabolism in ConA mice and AIH patients, which correlated with liver injury severity and therapeutic response. CD39 and CD73 were markedly upregulated on CD11b+Gr-1+ MCs under liver injury conditions. The naturally expanded CD39+CD73+Gr-1highCD11b+ MCreg subset during early liver injury effectively suppressed CD4+ T-cell hyperactivation and liver injury both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MCregs released CD73high EVs, which converted extracellular AMP to immunosuppressive metabolites (e.g., adenosine and inosine), activating the cAMP pathway and inhibiting glycolysis and cytokine secretion in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the mechanism controlling immune homeostasis during the early liver injury phase and highlights that MCreg or MCreg-EV therapy may be a specific strategy for preventing diverse liver diseases induced by T-cell overactivation.">

IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells.

One correlate of response is the reinvigoration of a subset of CD8 T cells that have an exhausted phenotype and impaired functionality.

Here we describe the development of an in vitro model by chronically stimulating T cells with their cognate antigen and performed an in depth temporal phenotypic characterisation. This model recapitulates many of the critical hallmarks of exhaustion, including increased expression of canonical exhaustion surface markers, impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production, decreased release of cytotoxic granules, and metabolic alterations, including dysfunctional mitochondria. These exhaustion hallmarks were validated using an in vivo model and a gene signature identified which robustly define the shared in vitro and in vivo exhausted state. Critically, this signature is also observed in tumour infiltrating T cells from multiple human tumour types, validating the translational potential of this model for discovering and triaging new therapies.">

        <tr id="Soil-transmitted helminths are one of the most common infections across the world, yet how to promote an effective humoral response to helminths is not well understood. To ensure the most effective response, molecular programs underpin the specialization of antibody effector subtype to microenvironmental signals. Here, we identify the methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) as a key target to promote IgA-driven responses. Mll1 was increased in germinal center (GC) B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and the absence of MLL1 in mature B cells led to significant reductions in GCs, IgG1 and IgE in response to the helminth Trichuris muris. Yet, worm expulsion occurred more rapidly in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice compared to control mice in the first two weeks of infection. Accelerated worm clearance correlated with significantly elevated IgA+ plasma cells (PC), serum IgA and fecal IgA in in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice. Stimulation of B cells in vitro confirmed that Mll1-deficiency accelerated the formation of IgA+ PC and that this effect was B cell-intrinsic. CCR9 was identified as a key MLL1-regulated molecule by RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry. Correspondingly, Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice infected with either T. muris or the bacterium C. rodentium significant increased IgA+CCR9+ PC localized in the large intestine. This tailoring of the B cell response to promote IgA-secreting PC correlated to a healthier microbiome in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice, compared to control mice. Thus, this study reveals MLL1 as a key target to tailor B cell responses to helminth infections, which may aid the development of effective mucosal vaccines or new targeted treatments. Significance statement Diseases caused by infections, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections or bacterial infections, continue to pose a major human health problem worldwide. One key reason why soil-transmitted helminths continue to cause long-term health and economic burdens is the lack of an effective vaccine for human use. Antibody responses underpin most successful vaccine designs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how B cell responses are regulated to produce tailored antibody to different pathogens is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. This study uncovered MLL1 as a novel therapeutic target to promote IgA-producing plasma cells, opening new avenues of investigation into how effective and tailored antibody responses may be produced in response to bacterial or helminth infection.">

        <tr id="HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive demyelinating disease of the spinal cord due to chronic inflammation. Hallmarks of disease pathology include dysfunctional anti-viral responses and the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system. HAM/TSP individuals exhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with elevated co-expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), but ICP blockade strategies can only partially restore CD8+ T-cell effector function. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles, can enhance the spread of viral infections and blunt anti-viral responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of exosomes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells and HAM/TSP patient sera on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell phenotypes and function. We observed that exosomes derived from HTLV-infected cell lines (OSP2) elicit proinflammatory cytokine responses in DCs, promote helper CD4+ T-cell polarization, and suppress CD8+ T-cell effector function. Furthermore, exosomes from individuals with HAM/TSP stimulate CD4+ T-cell polarization, marked by increased Th1 and regulatory T-cell differentiation. We conclude that exosomes in the setting of HAM/TSP are detrimental to DC and T-cell function and may contribute to the progression of pathology with HTLV-1 infection.">

In a study of a perforin-deficient mouse model of HLH with a viral trigger, we aimed to determine if CD8+ T cell behaviour could be modulated by targeted interleukin (IL)-2 treatment. We observed a paradoxical benefit that contrasted with IL-2’s typical role in boosting T cell activity: targeted IL-2 delivery to CD8+ T cells led to reduced hyperinflammation and disease severity. Our results demonstrated that IL-2 induced exhaustion in overactive CD8+ T cells, thus mitigating hyperinflammation. These findings highlight the context-dependency of cytokine treatment and suggest new therapeutic strategies for HLH and other inflammatory diseases by leveraging cell exhaustion.">

Here we report that the immune receptor CD300e is highly expressed by TAM in colorectal (CRC) and drives their immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic, correlating with reduced expression of MHC-II molecules, essential for antigen presentation. In vitro, CD300e-deficient macrophages exhibit enhanced pro-inflammatory activity and phagocytic capacity, coupled with reduced efferocytosis, suggesting a critical role for CD300e in promoting tumor progression. The depletion of CD300e, in vivo, results in a reduced tumor burden and enhanced survival in CRC mouse models, accompanied by a more robust anti-tumor immune response characterized by increased infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ.

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) belong to a continuous disease spectrum of myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory setting necessitating novel therapies. Natural killer (NK) cells from patients with myeloid malignancies display global dysfunction with impaired killing capacity, altered metabolism, and an exhausted phenotype at the single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In this study, we identified that this dysfunction was mediated through a cross-talk between NK cells and myeloid blasts necessitating cell-cell contact. NK cell dysfunction could be prevented by targeting the αvβ-integrin/TGF-β/SMAD pathway but, once established, was persistent because of profound epigenetic reprogramming. We identified BATF as a core transcription factor and the main mediator of this NK cell dysfunction in AML. Mechanistically, we found that BATF was directly regulated and induced by SMAD2/3 and, in turn, bound to key genes related to NK cell exhaustion, such as HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and CTLA4. BATF deletion enhanced NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism of NK immune evasion in AML manifested by epigenetic rewiring and inactivation of NK cells by myeloid blasts. This work highlights the importance of using healthy allogeneic NK cells as an adoptive cell therapy to treat patients with myeloid malignancies combined with strategies aimed at preventing the dysfunction by targeting the TGF-β pathway or BATF. BATF deletion prevents epigenetic rewiring and enhances the antitumor activity of NK cells in AML. Editor’s summary Patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often relapse after standard of care. To improve outcomes, Kumar et al. have investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in antitumor immunity against myeloid blasts and have identified global dysfunction of NK cells in these patients. They identified BATF as responsible for this dysfunction, and by knocking out BATF downstream of the TGF-β canonical pathway in NK cells, they were able to enhance NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. This has led to the initiation of a promising clinical trial using these TGFBR2 knockout NK cells against myeloid malignancies. —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="Age-related susceptibility to sepsis and endotoxemia is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system and the expansion of the visceral adipose as an immunological reservoir are underlying features. Macrophages from older organisms exhibit substantial changes, including chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, genomic remodeling and a dysfunctional, amplified inflammatory response upon new exposure to pathogen. However, the mechanisms by which old macrophages maintain their inflammatory phenotype during endotoxemia remains elusive. We previously identified Gdf3, a TGFβ superfamily cytokine, as a top-regulated gene by age and the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we demonstrate that endotoxemia increases inflammatory (CD11c+) ATMs in a Gdf3- dependent manner in old mice. Lifelong systemic or myeloid-specific deletion of Gdf3 leads to reduced endotoxemia- induced inflammation, with decreased CD11c+ ATMs and inflammatory cytokines, and protection from hypothermia. Moreover, acute blockade of Gdf3 using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, phenocopies old mice with lifelong Gdf3-deficiency. We show that GDF3 promotes the inflammatory phenotype in ATMs by phosphorylating SMAD2/3. Mechanistically, the differential chromatin landscape of ATMs from old mice with or without myeloid-driven Gdf3 indicates that GDF3- SMAD2/3 signaling axis shifts the chromatin accessibility of ATMs towards an inflammatory state during aging. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of SMAD3 with a specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3) mimics Gdf3 deletion. SIS3 reduces endotoxemia-mediated inflammation with fewer CD11c+ ATMs and less severe hypothermia in old, but not young mice, as well as reduced mortality. In human adipose tissue, age positively correlates with GDF3 level, while inflammation correlates with pSMAD2/3 level. Overall, these results highlight the importance of GDF3-SMAD2/3 axis in driving inflammation in older organisms and identify this signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating endotoxemia-related inflammation in the aged.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key mediators of lung function and are potential targets for therapies during respiratory infections. TGFβ is an important regulator of AM differentiation and maintenance, but how TGFβ directly modulates the innate immune responses of AMs remains unclear. This shortcoming prevents effective targeting of AMs to improve lung function in health and disease. Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGFβ in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGFβ regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGFβ maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGFβ alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGFβ (+) and TGFβ (−) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists. Together, these data suggest that TGFβ modulates AM metabolic networks and innate immune signaling cascades to control inflammatory pathways in AMs.">

Growing evidence suggests that the immune microenvironment in bone marrow influences prognosis and survival in AML. There is a specific association between CD8+ T cells and the prognosis of AML patients. To develop a CD8+ T cell-related immune risk score for AML, we first evaluated the accuracy of CIBERSORTx in predicting the abundance of CD8+ T cells in bulk RNA-seq and found it significantly correlated with observed single-cell RNA sequencing data and the proportions of CD8+ T cells derived from flow cytometry. Next, we constructed the CTCG15, a 15-gene prognostic signature, using univariate and LASSO regression on the differentially expressed genes between CD8+ THigh and CD8+ TLow groups. The CTCG15 was further validated across six datasets in different platforms. The CTCG15 has been shown to be independent of established prognostic markers, and can distill transcriptomic consequences of several genetic abnormalities closely related to prognosis in AML patients. Finally, integrating this model into the 2022 European LeukemiaNet contributed to a higher predictive power for prognosis prediction. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CD8+ T cell-related signature could improve the comprehensive risk stratification and prognosis prediction in AML.">

Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses. In sum, our findings uncover that lymphoid stromal chemokines act as built-in “disruptors” of T cell-DC interactions for long-term preservation of TEFF functionality.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the regenerative force of the gut epithelium. Lgr5+-ISC have been shown to respond to changes in their microenvironment by coping with different metabolites, adapting to caloric changes, and recovering from injury and inflammation. However, how pathogenic bacteria affect adult stem cell regeneration and, as a consequence, the overall tissue adaption to infection has yet to be explored in depth. Here, we interrogated early Lgr5+ ISC responses to an enteric intracellular pathogen by profiling individual IECs from the mouse small intestine. Utilizing GFP-labeled Salmonella enterica, we isolated intracellular invaded cells to elucidate invasion programs of epithelial cell subsets. In particular, we identified a Salmonella-specific infection signature comprised of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including the Defensin gene family. Our findings demonstrate that Salmonella enterica targets differentiated Paneth, enterocytes, and stem/progenitor cells at these early stages of infection. In response, a rapid Lg5+ ISC-driven cellular remodeling to enterocyte and Paneth lineages expressing AMP genes is initiated to combat the intruders. Importantly, we uncovered an ISC differentiation program via inflammasome activation to protect the crypt environment, while eliminating infected stem cells from the overall stem cell pool. This novel Lgr5+ stem cell defense mechanism not only protects the gut epithelium from persistent bacterial infection but also promotes tissue regeneration. We propose epithelial remodeling to AMP-secreting cells as a novel innate immune response to handle different gut stresses mediated by Lgr5+ ISCs to maintain organizational principles of gut homeostasis and physiology.">

        <tr id="Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) shows that inflammation starts early and progresses with age. B cells play a central role in this process, contributing to cytokine production, defective regulatory functions, and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system. Anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapies, which deplete CD20+ B cells, are largely used in the treatment of both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (PR) forms of MS. Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and a high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.">

        <tr id="Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) immunodeficiency syndrome is characterized by a failure of the germinal center response, a process involving the proliferation and positive selection of antigen-specific B cells. Here, we describe how DOCK8-deficient B cells are blocked at a light-zone checkpoint in the germinal centers of immunized mice, where they are unable to respond to T cell–dependent survival and selection signals and consequently differentiate into plasma cells or memory B cells. Although DOCK8-deficient B cells can acquire and present antigen to initiate activation of cognate T cells, integrin up-regulation, B cell–T cell conjugate formation, and costimulation are insufficient for sustained B cell and T cell activation when antigen availability is limited. Our findings provide an explanation for the failure of the humoral response in DOCK8 immunodeficiency syndrome and insight into how the level of available antigen modulates B cell–T cell cross-talk to fine-tune humoral immune responses and immunological memory. B cells activated by low amounts of antigen require DOCK8 to acquire survival and differentiation signals via T cell help. Editor’s summary In humans, loss-of-function mutations in dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) cause a rare, autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized, in part, by the failure of B cells to persist in germinal centers (GCs). Deobagkar-Lele et al. used Dock8-null mice to show that B cell–intrinsic DOCK8 bolsters the ability of antigen-specific B cells to receive and integrate survival signals from T follicular helper cells in the GC when the amount of antigen is limiting. This work provides insights into how the selection and affinity maturation of antigen-specific B cells can occur in the context of low antigen levels in the GC. —Seth Thomas Scanlon">

        <tr id="The intestinal immune system maintains a balance between active immunity needed for protection and tolerance towards harmless antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) found in the intestinal mucosa are key to the adaptive arm of these immunoregulatory events. DCs sample antigens in the tissue and then migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime the T cells that then migrate back to the tissue as effector or regulatory cells. Intestinal DC are highly heterogeneous, and it remains unclear exactly which subsets induces the different kinds of immune response, or what signalling molecules and cellular mechanisms are involved. Here, we have studied these issues using Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) infection in mice, a model which is uniquely suited to dissecting this regulatory circuit in the gut, where it drives type 2 protective immunity at the same time as inhibiting other aspects of the immune response. Here, we characterise intestinal DC during Hpb infection for the first time. We observed a dynamical change of intestinal DC populations throughout the course of infection that correlated with altered phenotype and function. In particular, Hpb infection saw a rise in a population of CD103+ DC2 that retained a potent ability to drive Tregs during the infection and unlike CD103-DC2, had a reduced ability to induce pro-inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that TGFβ signalling may be responsible for some of the changes observed. This was confirmed in vitro, where supplementation TGFβ or Hpb-produced TGFβ mimic (TGM) replicated the immunomodulatory effects seen in DCs in vivo. Together, these results present a mechanistic explanation of how helminths such as Hpb may modulate host immune responses by altering the differentiation and function of local DCs. Furthermore, our work provides the basis for understanding immune homeostasis in the intestine at the molecular and cellular levels. Thus, this work fills out a crucial gap in our knowledge of basic biology underlining the DC decision between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response in the central circuit of adaptive immune response.">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

        <tr id="CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to maintain peripheral self-tolerance and suppress immune responses to tumors. Their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with poor clinical outcome in several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC). However, the properties of intratumoral Tregs remain largely unknown. Here, we found that a functionally distinct subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, which express the Foxp3 splicing variant retaining exon 2 (Foxp3E2), is prominent in the TME and peripheral blood of hormone receptor- positive (HR+) BC subjects with poor prognosis. Notably, a comprehensive examination of the Tumor Cell Genome Atlas (TCGA) validated Foxp3E2 as an independent prognostic marker in all other BC subtypes. We found that FOXP3E2 expression underlies BCs with highly immune suppressive landscape, defective mismatch repair and a stem-like signature thus highlighting pathways involved in tumor immune evasion. Finally, we confirmed the higher immunosuppressive capacity of BC patients-derived Foxp3E2+ Tregs by functional assays. Our study suggests Foxp3E2+ Tregs might be used as an independent biomarker to predict BC prognosis and recurrence, and to develop super-targeted depletion-based immunotherapies. One-sentence summaries Foxp3E2+ Treg enrichment reflects an increased tumor-immune suppression and predicts prognosis and recurrence in breast cancer.">

The TLR pathway is an attractive actively studied target pathway. Because of their strong immunostimulatory activity, TLRs are thought to be a “double-edged sword” for systemic treatment, even in the cancer field. To solve this, we have developed dextran-based TAM targeting activating conjugate (D-TAC) technology, which successfully uses tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to deliver the TLR7 agonist DSP-0509. We used low molecular weight dextran to target CD206 high M2-type macrophages, activate them, and induce a change in phenotype to antitumor M1-type macrophages with rapid clearance from the body and astonishing antitumor activity. We also demonstrated that the antitumor effect of our best drug candidate 5DEX-0509R is dependent on the abundance of TAMs, which is consistent with their mechanism of action. We believe that 5DEX-0509R generated by D-TAC technology can be a clinically applicable immunotherapy targeting the TLR signaling pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell engagers (TCEs) are becoming an integral class of biological therapeutic owing to their highly potent ability to eradicate cancer cells. Nevertheless, the widespread utility of classical CD3-targeted TCEs has been limited by narrow therapeutic index (TI) linked to systemic CD4+ T cell activation and aberrant cytokine release. One attractive approach to circumvent the systemic activation of pan CD3+ T cells and reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome is to redirect specific subsets of T cells. A promising strategy is the use of peptide-major histocompatibility class I bispecific antibodies (pMHC-IgGs), which have emerged as an intriguing modality of TCE, based on their ability to selectively redirect highly reactive viral-specific effector memory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to eliminate cancer cells. However, the relatively low frequency of these effector memory cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may hamper their redirection as effector cells for clinical applications. To mitigate this potential limitation, we report here the generation of a pMHC-IgG derivative known as guided-pMHC-staging (GPS) carrying a covalent fusion of a monovalent interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutein (H16A, F42A). Using an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) arm as a proof-of-concept, tumor-associated antigen paired with a single-chain HLA-A *02:01/CMVpp65 pMHC fusion moiety, we demonstrate in vitro that the IL-2-armored GPS modality robustly expands CMVpp65-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells and induces potent cytotoxic activity against target cancer cells. Similar to GPS, IL-2-armored GPS molecules induce modulated T cell activation and reduced cytokine release profile compared to an analogous CD3-targeted TCE. In vivo we show that IL-2-armored GPS, but not the corresponding GPS, effectively expands grafted CMVpp65 CD8+ T cells from unstimulated human PBMCs in an NSG mouse model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the IL-2-armored GPS modality exhibits a favorable developability profile and monoclonal antibody-like pharmacokinetic properties in human neonatal Fc receptor transgenic mice. Overall, IL-2-armored GPS represents an attractive approach for treating cancer with the potential for inducing vaccine-like antiviral T cell expansion, immune cell redirection as a TCE, and significantly widened TI due to reduced cytokine release.">

Here, we extensively validate a combination of scRNA-seq profiling and matching flow cytometry isolation that reproducibly identifies 7 key CM and Endo populations across mouse strains and accurately surveys both niche locations. We demonstrate that different perturbations exert specific effects on different compartments, with type I interferon responses causing CM mesenchymal stromal cells to adopt an inflammatory phenotype associated with overproduction of chemokines modulating local monocyte dynamics in the surrounding microenvironment.

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="Background Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a serious liver disease characterized by immune disorders, particularly effector T-cell overactivation. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (MSC-EV) treatment on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and liver injury in AIH. Methods The metabolic changes of CD4+ T cells were assayed in human AIH and mouse hepatitis models. The liver protective effect of MSC-EVs was evaluated by transaminase levels, liver histopathology and inflammation. The effect of MSC-EVs on the metabolic state of CD4+ T cells was also explored. Results Enhanced glycolysis (eg, ~1.5-fold increase in hexokinase 2 levels) was detected in the CD4+ T cells of AIH patient samples and mouse hepatitis models, whereas the inhibition of glycolysis decreased CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.8-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and AIH liver injury (~6-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EV treatment reduced CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.5-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and cytokine release (~5-fold decrease in IFN-γ levels) by reducing glycolysis (~3-fold decrease) while enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (~2-fold increase in maximal respiration) in such cells. The degree of liver damage in AIH mice was ameliorated after MSC-EV treatment (~5-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EVs carried abundant mitochondrial proteins and might transfer them to metabolically reprogram CD4+ T cells, whereas disrupting mitochondrial transfer impaired the therapeutic potency of MSC-EVs in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusion Disordered glucose metabolism promotes CD4+ T-cell activation and associated inflammatory liver injury in AIH models, which can be reversed by MSC-EV therapy, and this effect is at least partially dependent on EV-mediated mitochondrial protein transfer between cells. This study highlights that MSC-EV therapy may represent a new avenue for treating autoimmune diseases such as AIH.">

We also found decreased histone deacetylase gene expression, increased MAP kinase gene expression, and increased accessibility at interferon-related gene promoter regions.

        <tr id="Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages have important roles in the initiation and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). These cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to generate immunophenotypes that promote leukocyte infiltration, axonal degeneration and demyelination, worsening MS pathology. The mechanisms that dictate metabolic programs in monocytes and macrophages in MS remain unclear. We previously reported that extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN, CD147), a glycoprotein that acts as a chaperone of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), assisted with glycolysis-driven pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Using newly-generated CCR2CreERT2:EMMPRINfl/fl (CCR2:EMMP) mice, we report that presymptomatic deletion of EMMPRIN in CCR2+ monocytes prevented or reduced clinical disability of EAE. This was correspondent with decreased infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS. Single cell RNA-seq of blood monocytes from EAE and proteomics analysis of macrophages from CCR2:EMMP−/− mice revealed significant alterations in metabolic programs, particularly reduced glycolysis and elevated mitochondrial electron transport and fatty acid oxidation, which were linked to their reduced pro-inflammatory traits. Our findings implicate EMMPRIN as a key regulator of metabolic pathways that exacerbate pro-inflammatory functions of monocytes in MS.">

Analysis of persistent clones showed transcriptional changes that are differentially induced by therapy in the different response groups, suggesting an improved reinvigoration capacity in responding patients. Moreover, a gene trajectory analysis revealed changes in the pseudo-temporal state of de-novo clones that are associated with response to therapy. Lastly, we found that clones shared between tumor and blood are more abundant in non-responders and execute distinct transcriptional programs.

They are TCF1+ PD-1+ and important for the expansion of tumor specific CD8+ T cells in response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. In acute infections, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector and memory CD8+ T cells; in cancer and chronic infections, persistent antigen stimulation can lead to T cell exhaustion. Recent studies have highlighted the dichotomy between late dysfunctional (or exhausted) T cells (TLD) that are TCF1– PD-1+ and self-renewing TCF1+ PD-1+ TSL from which they derive. TCF1+ TSL cells are considered to have stem cell-like properties akin to memory T cell populations and can give rise to cytotoxic effector and transitory T cell phenotypes (TTE) which mediate tumor control. In this review, we will discuss recent advances made in research on the formation and expansion of TSL, as well as distinct niches required for their differentiation and maintenance in the setting of cancer. We will also discuss potential strategies to generate these cells, with clinical implications for stemness enhancement in vaccine design, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and adoptive T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="Vaccines incorporating slow delivery, multivalent antigen display, or immunomodulation through adjuvants have an important role to play in shaping the humoral immune response. Here we analyzed mechanisms of action of a clinically relevant combination adjuvant strategy, where phosphoserine (pSer)-tagged immunogens bound to aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant (promoting prolonged antigen delivery to draining lymph nodes) are combined with a potent saponin nanoparticle adjuvant termed SMNP (which alters lymph flow and antigen entry into lymph nodes). When employed with a stabilized HIV Env trimer antigen in mice, this combined adjuvant approach promoted substantial enhancements in germinal center (GC) and antibody responses relative to either adjuvant alone. Using scRNA-seq and scBCR-seq, we found that the alum-pSer/SMNP combination both increased the diversity of GC B cell clones and increased GC B cell clonal expansion, coincident with increases in the expression of Myc and the proportion of S-phase GC B cells. To gain insight into the source of these changes in the GC response, we analyzed antigen biodistribution and structural integrity in draining lymph nodes and found that the combination adjuvant approach, but not alum-pSer delivery or SMNP alone, promoted accumulation of highly intact antigen on follicular dendritic cells, reflecting an integration of the slow antigen delivery and altered lymph node uptake effects of these two adjuvants. These results demonstrate how adjuvants with complementary mechanisms of action impacting vaccine biodistribution and kinetics can synergize to enhance humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction Biological processes such as aging, carcinogenesis, and immune response rely on the ability to maintain or rapidly expand cell populations. The fitness of the involved cells is constrained by their replicative potential, which is reflected in the cellular telomere content. Method We apply TelomereHunter to scATAC-seq data to determine telomere content on single-cell level, in a hematopoietic dataset consisting of 35,139 cells from samples of basal cell carcinoma patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade treatment. Integrating information from open-chromatin-based signatures to assess cell identity, we characterize the heterogeneity of telomere length for individual cell populations pre- and post-immunotherapy. Results The extracted telomeric reads reflect the expected telomereome-to-genome fraction. Telomere content distributions differ significantly between cell populations, and the median telomere content in intermediate and terminal exhausted CD8+ T-cells pre-treatment is significantly correlated to response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Likewise, telomere content correlates with post-treatment cell proliferation in terminally exhausted and T follicular helper cells from responding patients. Conclusion Telomere content measurement from scATAC-seq data has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to detect significant differences between cell types. Furthermore, the telomere content of CD8+ exhausted T-cells pre-treatment is a putative biomarker for successful PD-1-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Vaccine adjuvants are typically composed of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immune cells. Advances in basic immunology have demonstrated the need for various ‘types’ of protective immunity, which are difficult to achieve with a single adjuvant. The FDA approval of multiple PAMP-DAMP combinations for clinical use has led to an increased momentum in the area in recent years. Here we report the use of DAMP-inducing peptide nanofibers (PNFs) and CL429 (PAMP) combinations as subunit boosters for Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). We demonstrate that pulmonary boosting with PNFs and CL429 enhances the lung-resident memory phenotype, effector cytokine profiles, and transcription factor bias of antigen-specific CD4+T cell populations compared to PNFs alone. Importantly, the combination significantly improved the frequency of tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells which, have been shown to provide superior protection compared to circulating memory T cells. Interestingly, the T helper (Th) subset profile was driven in part driven by the route of vaccination resulting in a Th17 bias via a mucosal route or a Th1 bias when delivered intravenously. We show that following pulmonary administration, lung-resident antigen presenting cells (APCs) efficiently internalize PNFs and upregulate important co-stimulatory markers that drive T cell priming and activation. Our findings suggest that heterologous booster vaccines composed of DAMP-inducing PNFs and PAMP combinations can engage innate and adaptive immunity for generating TRM cells that protect against TB and potentially other respiratory diseases.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Currently, there are no effective therapies for glioblastoma. Infiltrating myeloid cells contributes significantly to the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment that is characteristic of GBM. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells are chief immune suppressive cells found in the glioma microenvironment. Understanding the mechanisms of M-MDSC differentiation and T-cell suppression is imperative for generating therapies that target this tumor-supportive cell population. In this study, we found that glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands, M-CSF and IL-34, promote M-MDSCs to suppress CD8 T cells. These M-MDSCs partially utilize nitric oxide synthase to illicit their suppressive activity. However, spatial RNAseq points to glioma microenvironment niches driving M-MDSC heterogeneity. Our findings identify key regulators of differentiation and suppressive mechanisms of M-MDSCs and confirm the importance of targeting this cell population in glioma. Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, resulting in poor survival despite aggressive therapies. GBM is characterized by a highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) made up predominantly of infiltrating peripheral immune cells. One significant immune cell type that contributes to glioma immune evasion is a population of immunosuppressive cells, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Previous studies suggest that a subset of myeloid cells, expressing monocytic (M)-MDSC markers and dual expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1, utilize CCR2 to infiltrate the TME. This study evaluated the mechanism of CCR2+/CX3CR1+ M-MDSC differentiation and T cell suppressive function in murine glioma models. We determined that bone marrow-derived CCR2+/CX3CR1+ cells adopt an immune suppressive cell phenotype when cultured with glioma-derived factors. Glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands M-CSF and IL-34 were identified as key drivers of M-MDSC differentiation while adenosine and iNOS pathways were implicated in the M-MDSC suppression of T cells. Mining a human GBM spatial RNAseq database revealed a variety of different pathways that M-MDSCs utilize to exert their suppressive function that is driven by complex niches within the microenvironment. These data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of M-MDSCs in glioblastoma.">

While the cellular machinery and metabolic pathways involved in efferocytosis have been characterized, the precise efferocytic response of macrophages is dependent on the identity and macromolecular cues of apoptotic cells, and the complex tissue microenvironment in which efferocytosis occurs. Here, we find that macrophages undergoing active efferocytosis in mid-stage mouse skin wounds in vivo display a pro-repair gene program, while efferocytosis of apoptotic skin fibroblasts in vitro also induces an inflammatory transcription response.

        <tr id="Macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is widely used in clinical practice to treat respiratory tract infections and inflammatory diseases. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway. From a clinical perspective, this study also sheds light on potential clinical benefits observed in patients on prophylactic AZM regimens against various respiratory diseases and opens avenues for future adjunct therapy against Th1- and Tc1-dominated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="The thymus is the central organ involved with T-cell development and the production of naïve T cells. During normal aging, the thymus undergoes marked involution, reducing naïve T-cell output and resulting in a predominance of long-lived memory T cells in the periphery. Outside of aging, systemic stress responses that induce corticosteroids (CS), or other insults such as radiation exposure, induce thymocyte apoptosis, resulting in a transient acute thymic involution with subsequent recovery occurring after cessation of the stimulus. Despite the increasing utilization of immunostimulatory regimens in cancer, effects on the thymus and naïve T cell output have not been well characterized. Using both mouse and human systems, the thymic effects of systemic immunostimulatory regimens, such as high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) with or without agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs and acute primary viral infection, were investigated. These regimens produced a marked acute thymic involution in mice, which correlated with elevated serum glucocorticoid levels and a diminishment of naïve T cells in the periphery. This effect was transient and followed with a rapid thymic “rebound” effect, in which an even greater quantity of thymocytes was observed compared to controls. Similar results were observed in humans, as patients receiving HD IL-2 treatment for cancer demonstrated significantly increased cortisol levels, accompanied by decreased peripheral blood naïve T cells and reduced T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a marker indicative of recent thymic emigrants. Mice adrenalectomized prior to receiving immunotherapy or viral infection demonstrated protection from this glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution, despite experiencing a substantially higher inflammatory cytokine response and increased immunopathology. Investigation into the effects of immunostimulation on middle aged (7-12 months) and advance aged (22-24 months) mice, which had already undergone significant thymic involution and had a diminished naïve T cell population in the periphery at baseline, revealed that even further involution was incurred. Thymic rebound hyperplasia, however, only occurred in young and middle-aged recipients, while advance aged not only lacked this rebound hyperplasia, but were entirely absent of any indication of thymic restoration. This coincided with prolonged deficits in naïve T cell numbers in advanced aged recipients, further skewing the already memory dominant T cell pool. These results demonstrate that, in both mice and humans, systemic immunostimulatory cancer therapies, as well as immune challenges like subacute viral infections, have the potential to induce profound, but transient, glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution and substantially reduced thymic output, resulting in the reduction of peripheral naive T cells. This can then be followed by a marked rebound effect with naïve T cell restoration, events that were shown not to occur in advanced-aged mice.">

        <tr id="Proliferating tumor cells take up glutamine for anabolic processes engendering glutamine deficiency in the tumor microenvironment. How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets – cDC1 and cDC2, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on Glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mTOR signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses. One Sentence Summary Type 1 conventional dendritic cells require glutamine to maintain their number in non-lymphoid tissue. Significance Immune evasion is a key hallmark of cancer; however, the underlying pathways are diverse, tumor-specific and not fully elucidated. Many tumor cells avidly import glutamine to support their anabolic needs, creating a glutamine-deficient tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, using mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, we show that glutamine depletion in TME leads to reduced type 1 conventional dendritic cells – a cell type that is critical for adaptive immune responses. This work is a paradigm for how tumor cell metabolism can regulate anti-tumor immune responses and will be foundational to future efforts targeting glutamine metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The role of Erythroid cells in immune regulation and immunosuppression is one of the emerging topics in modern immunology that still requires further clarification as Erythroid cells from different tissues and different species express different immunoregulatory molecules. In this study, we performed a thorough investigation of human bone marrow Erythroid cells from adult healthy donors and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients using the state-of-the-art single-cell targeted proteomics and transcriptomics via BD Rhapsody and cancer-related gene copy number variation analysis via NanoString Sprint Profiler. We found that human bone marrow Erythroid cells express the ARG1, LGALS1, LGALS3, LGALS9, and C10orf54 (VISTA) immunosuppressive genes, CXCL5, CXCL8, and VEGFA cytokine genes, as well as the genes involved in antimicrobial immunity and MHC Class II antigen presentation. We also found that ARG1 gene expression was restricted to the single erythroid cell cluster that we termed ARG1-positive Orthochromatic erythroblasts and that late Erythroid cells lose S100A9 and gain MZB1 gene expression in case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These findings show that steady-state erythropoiesis bone marrow Erythroid cells express myeloid signature genes even without any transdifferentiating stimulus like cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Smooth muscle cell (SMC) plasticity and phenotypic switching play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, but their role in tumorigenesis is unknown. We investigated whether and how SMC diversity and plasticity plays a role in tumor angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment. Methods and Results We use SMC-specific lineage-tracing mouse models and single cell RNA sequencing to observe the phenotypic diversity of SMCs participating in tumor vascularization. We find that a significant proportion of SMCs adopt a phenotype traditionally associated with macrophage-like cells. These cells are transcriptionally similar to ‘resolution phase’ M2b macrophages, which have been described to have a role in inflammation resolution. Computationally predicted by the ligand-receptor algorithm CellChat, signaling from BST2 on the surface of tumor cells to PIRA2 on SMCs promote this phenotypic transition; in vitro SMC assays demonstrate upregulation of macrophage transcriptional programs, and increased proliferation, migration, and phagocytic ability when exposed to BST2. Knockdown of BST2 in the tumor significantly decreases the transition towards a macrophage-like phenotype, and cells that do transition have a comparatively higher inflammatory signal typically associated with anti-tumor effect. Conclusion As BST2 is known to be a poor prognostic marker in multiple cancers where it is associated with an M2 macrophage-skewed TME, these studies suggest that phenotypically switched SMCs may have a previously unidentified role in this immunosuppressive milieu. Further translational work is needed to understand how this phenotypic switch could influence the response to anti-cancer agents and if targeted inhibition of SMC plasticity would be therapeutically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Introduction Pediatric patients with unexplained bone marrow failure (BMF) are often categorized as aplastic anemia (AA). Based on the accepted hypothesis of an auto-immune mechanism underlying AA, immune suppressive therapy (IST) might be effective. However, due to the lack of diagnostic tools to identify immune AA and prognostic markers to predict IST response together with the unequaled curative potential of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), most pediatric severe AA patients are momentarily treated by HSCT if available. Although several studies indicate oligoclonal T-cells with cytotoxic activities towards the hematopoietic stem cells, increasing evidence points towards defective inhibitory mechanisms failing to inhibit auto-reactive T-cells. Methods We aimed to investigate the role of NK- and B-cells in seven pediatric AA patients through a comprehensive analysis of paired bone marrow and peripheral blood samples with spectral flow cytometry in comparison to healthy age-matched bone marrow donors. Results We observed a reduced absolute number of NK-cells in peripheral blood of AA patients with a skewed distribution towards CD56bright NK-cells in a subgroup of patients. The enriched CD56bright NK-cells had a lower expression of CD45RA and TIGIT and a higher expression of CD16, compared to healthy donors. Functional analysis revealed no differences in degranulation. However, IFN-γ production and perforin expression of NK-cells were reduced in the CD56bright-enriched patient group. The diminished NK-cell function in this subgroup might underly the auto-immunity. Importantly, NK-function of AA patients with reduced CD56bright NK-cells was comparable to healthy donors. Also, B-cell counts were lower in AA patients. Subset analysis revealed a trend towards reduction of transitional B-cells in both absolute and relative numbers compared to healthy controls. As these cells were previously hypothesized as regulatory cells in AA, decreased numbers might be involved in defective inhibition of auto-reactive T-cells. Interestingly, even in patients with normal distribution of precursor B-cells, the transitional compartment was reduced, indicating partial differentiation failure from immature to transitional B-cells or a selective loss. Discussion Our findings provide a base for future studies to unravel the role of transitional B-cells and CD56bright NK-cells in larger cohorts of pediatric AA patients as diagnostic markers for immune AA and targets for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, yet targeting them for therapeutic intervention has been discouraged due to the associated risk of infections. Thus, identification of neutrophil subsets and their involvement in inflammatory conditions is warranted for targeted therapeutic strategies. This study, through screening of surface proteins on neutrophils isolated from different tissue microenvironments, identified a distinct neutrophil subset, CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils, expressing Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). Interestingly, these Sca1pos neutrophils were more abundant in the liver than BM, blood, and lungs. Further analysis revealed that Sca1pos neutrophils are mature and activated with enhanced effector functions, including superoxide generation, phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. Tracing studies demonstrated ageing-independent characteristics of Sca1pos neutrophils. Remarkably, Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophils promote T cell proliferation through ROS, while inhibition of Sca-1 restores T cell proliferation and ROS generation. Intriguingly, inflammatory as well as metabolic cues induce the transition of conventional neutrophils (Sca1neg) to Sca1pos neutrophils and differentiation of progenitors (granulocyte monocyte progenitors, GMPs) into Sca1pos neutrophils. Furthermore, in vivo models of acute inflammation, peritonitis, and chronic inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exhibit an increase of Sca1pos neutrophils at inflammatory sites, while the pharmacological approach using NAC specifically mitigates the expansion of these pro-inflammatory neutrophils. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel subset of Sca1pos neutrophils with implications for inflammation. Significance Statement Neutrophilic inflammation remains the leading driver in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Targeting neutrophil populations remained un-recommended due to hampering the immunological functions of neutrophils. The heterogeneity of neutrophils provides the perspective to target altered neutrophil subsets, but subtle changes defining neutrophil subsets make it complex and ambiguous. Our study identified abundant expression of Sca1on distinct neutrophils under steady state and inflammation. Thus, we reported previously undefined Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophil subsets and elucidated their regulation. This study further established their involvement in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. This understanding may further pave the way toward targeting specific neutrophil subsets in pathologies characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. Graphical Abstract Highlights CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophil subset identified with <1% presence in BM and >40% frequency in the liver. These neutrophils are mature and activated, demonstrating enhanced effector functions. Sca1pos neutrophils promote T cell proliferation and display pro-inflammatory characteristics. Conventional Sca1neg neutrophils transition into Sca1pos neutrophils in response to inflammatory signals, while progenitors undergo differentiation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory models show the expansion of CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils.">

In this study, we performed cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cART-naïve HIV+ individuals and cART-naïve HIV+ individuals prior to AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (pre-NHL) diagnosis. Participants were enrolled in the Los Angeles site of the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and unsupervised clustering analysis were performed to identify differences in the expression of B-cell activation markers and/or oncogenic markers associated with lymphomagenesis. CD10+CD27- B cells, CD20+CD27- B cells, and B-cell populations with aberrant features (CD20+CD27+CXCR4+CD71+ B cells and CD20+CXCR4+cMYC+ B cells) were significantly elevated in HIV+ cART-naïve compared to HIV-negative samples. CD20+CD27+CD24+CXCR4+CXCR5+ B cells, CD20+CD27+CD10+CD24+CXCR4+cMYC+ B cells, and a cluster of CD20+CXCR4hiCD27-CD24+CXCR5+CD40+CD4+AICDA+ B cells were significantly elevated in HIV+ pre-NHL (cART-naïve) compared to HIV+ cART-naïve samples.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells often become dysfunctional during tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unclear. To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are routinely mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) to the blood circulation for clinical transplantation. However, the precise mechanisms by which individual stem cells exit the marrow are not understood. This study identified cell-extrinsic and molecular determinants of a mobilizable pool of blood-forming stem cells. We found that a subset of HSCs displays macrophage-associated markers on their cell surface. Although fully functional, these HSCs are selectively niche-retained as opposed to stem cells lacking macrophage markers, which exit the BM upon forced mobilization. Macrophage markers on HSCs could be acquired through direct transfer by trogocytosis, regulated by receptor tyrosine-protein kinase C-Kit (CD117), from BM-resident macrophages in mouse and human settings. Our study provides proof of concept that adult stem cells utilize trogocytosis to rapidly establish and activate function-modulating molecular mechanisms. Editor’s summary Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to red and white blood cells. They can be released from the bone marrow into the blood in low numbers during homeostasis or in greater numbers in response to infection and disease. Working with mouse and human cells, Gao et al. found that HSCs in the bone marrow could be distinguished by the expression of proteins associated with macrophages. These proteins were not produced within HSCs, but might be acquired from bone marrow–associated macrophages through a process of cell-cell membrane transfer that could be negatively regulated by signaling associated with the stem cell growth factor. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce all types of blood cells and ensure lifelong maintenance and replenishment of the hematopoietic system. These adult stem cells reside in a specialized microenvironment in the bone marrow (BM) yet show a distinctive behavior whereby a small fraction of their population continuously egresses from the BM to travel into blood circulation—a process termed “stem cell mobilization.” This property is harnessed in the clinic by enforcing HSC mobilization through pharmacological modulation of hematopoietic cytokine signaling through exposure to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) antagonists. Mobilized HSCs are harvested from the peripheral blood for subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, e.g., for treatment of patients with cancer, autoimmune, and other disorders. RATIONALE The mechanisms governing mobilization of individual HSCs into the blood are incompletely understood. Moreover, current therapeutic regimens fall short in stimulating BM egress of sufficient numbers of HSCs in a sizable proportion of patients. We therefore analyzed the proteins expressed on the surface of HSCs isolated from mice and investigated the mechanisms underlying the ability of most HSCs to be retained in BM while others can be mobilized. RESULTS We found that a large subset of HSCs displayed macrophage-associated markers, including F4/80 and CD169, on their cell surface. We assessed long-term regenerative multilineage repopulation capacity and the ability to mobilize from the BM upon forced mobilization or aging in HSCs expressing or not expressing macrophage markers. Macrophage marker–presenting HSCs were fully functional and largely retained in the BM, whereas stem cells without detectable macrophage-marker presentation readily exited the BM upon forced mobilization. Using in vitro cocultures of HSCs and macrophages, we discovered that HSCs could use trogocytosis (TROGPos HSCs)—a rapid and active transfer mechanism for surface molecules in which plasma membrane fragments are trafficked from one cell to another. Trogocytosis was impaired in the presence of stem cell factor. We therefore utilized genetic and pharmacological mouse models, as well as primary human cell–based assays, to trace how macrophage membrane material could be transferred onto HSCs. These efforts identified receptor tyrosine kinase C-Kit as a marker of stem cell trogocytosis and showed that HSCs with high C-Kit presentation on their cell surface could engage this mechanism to acquire CXCR4 from adjacent macrophages to increase stem cell retention in the niche. CONCLUSION We uncovered a definable pool of mobilizable stem cells and demonstrated that membrane-fragment transfer from macrophages could be functionalized by HSCs for BM retention. Our study provides proof of concept that adult stem cells can utilize trogocytosis to establish and activate function-modulating molecular mechanisms rapidly. These findings have implications for the development of more effective HSC mobilization strategies in the clinic, potentially through exploiting pharmacologic impairment of C-Kit. They will also spark efforts into delineating how much HSCs use trogocytosis to acutely gain function in other contexts, as well as the extent to which the hematopoietic system may use trogocytosis-mediated cell killing for eliminating defective stem cells. Model for C-Kit–dependent trogocytosis regulates niche retention in blood stem cells. A subset of HSCs (marked by high C-Kit expression) can acquire membrane material from adjacent macrophages through trogocytosis (TROGPos HSC) to augment retention in the bone marrow. Stem cells with low C-Kit expression are mobilized to the peripheral blood. ILLUSTRATION: TATYANA A. HARRIS FROM THE EINSTEIN CREATIVE SERVICES TEAM">

        <tr id="How group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate mucosal protection in the presence of T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we examined ILC3 function in intestinal immunity using ILC3-deficient mice that maintain endogenous T cells, T helper 17 (TH17) cells, and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were dispensable for generation of TH17 and TH22 cell responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and absence of ILC3s did not affect IL-22 production by CD4 T cells before or during infection. However, despite the presence of IL-22–producing T cells, ILC3s and ILC3-derived IL-22 were required for maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestinal epithelium. T cell–sufficient, ILC3-deficient mice were capable of pathogen clearance and survived infection with a low dose of Citrobacter rodentium. However, ILC3s promoted pathogen tolerance at early time points of infection by activating tissue-protective immune pathways. Consequently, ILC3s were indispensable for survival after high-dose infection. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent role for ILC3s in immune-sufficient animals and provide a blueprint for uncoupling of ILC3 and TH17 cell functions. In T cell–sufficient mice, ILC3s are required for mucosal protection from high-dose but not low-dose bacterial infection. Editor’s summary Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and immunity against gut pathogens. Distinguishing the functions of ILC3s from those of T helper 17 (TH17) cells has remained challenging because of similar transcription factor dependencies and cytokine production profiles. To better define ILC3-specific roles, Araujo et al. developed genetically engineered mice that lack ILC3s while retaining endogenous T cells and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were the primary producers of IL-22, which was required for the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Whereas TH17 cells were sufficient to protect against low-dose Citrobacter rodentium infection, ILC3s provided early protection and were required for survival after high-dose infection. Together, these findings identify nonredundant functions of ILC3s in mucosal homeostasis and immunity. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease characterized by chronic inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, and substantial characterization of molecular signatures of glial and immune cells in the disease has been conducted. However, comparatively less well characterized is the molecular signature of pathologically inflamed neurons. Here, we accessed multi-omic high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic data to investigate the molecular signature of neurons from progressive MS patients and from mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate a shared and consistent neuronal gene expression signature in MS and EAE samples including a notable upregulation of immune system related genes and processes. Analysis of immune-enriched pathways in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and motor neurons from mice subjected to EAE revealed enrichment for the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway and interferon response genes in both types of neurons, and ATAC-seq analysis confirmed the accessibility of these genes. Parallel analyses of neurons from MS patients identified a signature of 48 commonly upregulated immune genes in neurons. Prediction of transcriptional regulators of these genes identified key upstream regulators including signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon response factor 5 (IRF5), highly involved in immune-related processes, with significant gene expression changes in both RGCs and motor neurons. Protein-protein interaction analyses among the transcriptional regulators unveiled intricate interactions among transcription factors, especially from the IRF and STAT families, suggesting their importance in regulating immune gene expression in inflamed neurons. Small molecule inhibition of IRF5 in inflamed neurons in vitro promoted cell survival and reduced the expression of the immune gene signature, supporting the biological relevance of IRF5 in mediating the neuronal inflammatory response. Together, this study identifies regulated immune processes in neurons from EAE mice and from MS patient samples suggesting potential roles for neuronal immune molecules in disease progression, as revealed by transcriptomic, epigenomic, and experimental approaches. Further, the results strongly implicate active interferon signaling in neurons driving immune related changes in gene expression through IRF5 and STAT1 transcription factor activity, potentially impacting downstream neuronal survival through IRF5 activity.">

        <tr id="Ionizing radiation exposure can cause damage to diverse tissues and organs, with the hematopoietic system being the most sensitive. However, limited information is available regarding the radiosensitivity of various hematopoietic cell populations in the bone marrow due to the high heterogeneity of the hematopoietic system. In this study, we observed that granulocyte–macrophage progenitors, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and B cells within the bone marrow showed the highest sensitivity, exhibiting a rapid decrease in cell numbers following irradiation. Nonetheless, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and dendritic cells demonstrated a certain degree of radioresistance, with neutrophils exhibiting the most pronounced resistance. By employing single-cell transcriptome sequencing, we investigated the early responsive genes in various cell types following irradiation, revealing that distinct gene expression profiles emerged between radiosensitive and radioresistant cells. In B cells, radiation exposure led to a specific upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, suggesting a connection between these complexes and cell radiosensitivity. In neutrophils, radiation exposure resulted in fewer gene alterations, indicating their potential for distinct mechanisms in radiation resistance. Collectively, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity of radiosensitivity among the various bone marrow hematopoietic cell populations.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell-derived hematologic malignancy whose progression depends on active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Despite the spectacular efficacy of Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), resistance can develop in CLL patients, and alternative therapeutic strategies are therefore required. Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care and may be an attractive approach in this context. We speculated that characterizing the immune responses of CLL patients may highlight putative immunotherapeutic targets. Here, we used high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry to compare the distribution and phenotype of non-B-cell immune populations in the circulating blood of CLL patients treated with Ibrutinib displaying a complete response or secondary progression. Although no drastic changes were observed in the composition of their immune subsets, the Ibrutinib-resistant group showed increased cycling of CD8+ T cells, leading to their overabundance at the expense of dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of 11 different surface checkpoints was similar regardless of response status. Together, this suggests that CLL relapse upon Ibrutinib treatment may not lead to major alterations in the peripheral immune response.">

        <tr id="Emerging data have highlighted a correlation between microbiome composition and cancer immunotherapy outcome. While commensal bacteria and their metabolites are known to modulate the host environment, contradictory effects and a lack of mechanistic understanding impede the translation of microbiome-based therapies into the clinic. In this study, we demonstrate that abundance of the commensal metabolite pentanoate is predictive for survival of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell patients in two independent cohorts. Its implementation in the CAR T cell manufacturing workflow overcomes solid tumor microenvironments in immunocompetent cancer models by hijacking the epigenetic-metabolic crosstalk, reducing exhaustion and promoting naive-like differentiation. While synergy of clinically relevant drugs mimicked the phenotype of pentanoate-engineered CAR T cells in vitro, in vivo challenge showed inferior tumor control. Metabolic tracing of 13C-pentanoate revealed citrate generation in the TCA cycle via the acetyl- and succinyl-CoA entry points as a unique feature of the C5 aliphatic chain. Inhibition of the ATP-citrate lyase, which links metabolic output and histone acetylation, led to accumulation of pentanoate-derived citrate from the succinyl-CoA route and decreased functionality of SCFA-engineered CAR T cells. Our data demonstrate that microbial metabolites are incorporated as epigenetic imprints and implementation into CAR T cell production might serve as embodiment of the microbiome-host axis benefits for clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Monocyte-derived macrophages recruited into inflamed tissues can acquire an array of functional states depending on the extracellular environment. Since the anti-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic macrophage profile is determined by MAFB, whose activity/protein levels are regulated by GSK3, we addressed the macrophage re-programming potential of GSK3 modulation. GM-CSF-dependent (GM-MØ) and M-CSF-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MØ) exhibited distinct levels of inactive GSK3, and inhibiting GSK3 in GM-MØ led to acquisition of transcriptional, phenotypic and functional properties characteristic of M-MØ (enhanced expression of IL-10 and monocyte-recruiting factors, and higher efferocytosis). These re-programming effects were also observed upon GSK3α/β knockdown, and through GSK3 inhibition in ex vivo isolated human alveolar macrophages (AMØ). Notably, GSK3 downmodulation potentiated the transcriptional signature of Interstitial Macrophages (IMØ) while suppressed the AMØ-specific gene profile. Indeed, heightened levels of inactive GSK3 and MAFB-dependent proteins were observed in severe COVID-19 patients lung macrophages, highlighting the GSK3-MAFB axis as a therapeutic target for macrophage re-programming.">

We uncovered the dual nature of Tregs: they prevented autoimmune diseases by maintaining self-tolerance while contributing to tumor evasion by suppressing anti-tumor immunity. This study underscored the potential for targeted therapeutic strategies, such as enhancing Treg activity to restore balance in autoimmune diseases or depleting Foxp3+Tregs to augment anti-tumor immune responses in cancer. These insights laid the groundwork for future research and clinical applications, emphasizing the critical role of Foxp3+Tregs in immune regulation and the advancement of next-generation immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid malignancies arise in bone marrow microenvironments and shape these microenvironments in favor of malignant development. Immune suppression is one of the most important stages in myeloid leukemia progression. Leukemic clone expansion and immune dysregulation occur simultaneously in bone marrow microenvironments. Complex interactions emerge between normal immune system elements and leukemic clones in the bone marrow. In recent years, researchers have identified several of these pathological interactions. For instance, recent works shows that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), from bone marrow stromal cells contributes to immune dysregulation and the selective proliferation of JAK2V617F+ clones in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Moreover, inflammasome activation and sterile inflammation result in inflamed microenvironments and the development of myelodysplastic syndromes. Additional immune dysregulations, such as exhaustion of T and NK cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, and impairments in antigen presentation are common findings in myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the role of altered bone marrow microenvironments in the induction of immune dysregulations that accompany myeloid malignancies. We also consider both current and novel therapeutic strategies to restore normal immune system function in the context of myeloid malignancies.">

        <tr id="Despite decades of research, survival from brain cancer has scarcely improved and is drastically lower than that of other cancers. Novel therapies, such as immunotherapy, hold great promise for treating brain tumours and are desperately needed. Zika virus (ZIKV) infects and kills aggressive cancer cells with stem-like properties (CSCs) from both paediatric and adult brain tumours. Whilst T cell recruitment into ZIKV-infected brain tumours is becoming well documented, the specific mechanisms through which they are activated are poorly understood. We address this by employing a combined LC-MS/MS global proteome and immunopeptidome approach to describe, for the first time, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presentation of ZIKV peptides on the surface of infected brain tumour cells. We first show that HLA class I (HLA-I) antigen processing & presentation is the most highly enriched immune response pathway in the global proteome of aggressive paediatric USP7-ATRT brain tumour cells following ZIKV infection. We identify USP7-ATRT cells as a good immunopeptidome model due to their homozygous of the globally most common HLA-A allotype (A*02:01). We predict the majority of the 19 ZIKV peptides that we identify here to strongly bind and be presented by HLA-A*02:01. We show that immunopeptide presentation corresponds with cellular ZIKV protein abundance, with ten peptides arising from the most abundant viral protein; non-structural protein 3 (NS3). Specifically, we show the ZIKV NS3 helicase domain to be a rich source of peptides. Finally, we verify that the identified ZIKV peptides do not mimic predicted peptides of the human proteome. The ZIKV peptides we identify here are potential candidates for developing novel epitope-specific brain tumour immunotherapies, and our findings provide potential insight into the efficacious cytotoxic T cell response that oncolytic ZIKV virotherapy can induce against brain tumours. Author Summary Viruses can attack cancer through two mechanisms: 1) infecting and killing the cancer cell and 2) activating the immune system against the tumour. Zika virus (ZIKV) uses both mechanisms to fight brain cancer. Here, we employ a powerful proteomic technique to identify fragments of viral proteins (peptides) presented by cell surface receptors on brain cancer cells infected with ZIKV. In the human body, immune system cells such as T cells recognise and become activated in response to these viral peptides and subsequently attack the infected patient tumour. We identify 19 ZIKV peptides, three of which have been shown previously to elicit T cell responses, four identified elsewhere, and twelve are novel. Our work helps delineate a component of how ZIKV acts as an immunotherapy, the T cell-specific immune response that the virus raises to promote clearance of brain tumours. The significance of our study is that the ZIKV peptides we identify may lead to the development of a novel brain tumour immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="In the previous studies, anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 bispecific antibody YM101 is demonstrated, with superior efficacy to anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in multiple tumor models. However, YM101 therapy can not achieve complete regression in most tumor-bearing mice, suggesting the presence of other immunosuppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME) beyond TGF-β and PD-L1. Thoroughly exploring the TME is imperative to pave the way for the successful translation of anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 BsAb into clinical practice. In this work, scRNA-seq is employed to comprehensively profile the TME changes induced by YM101. The scRNA-seq analysis reveals an increase in immune cell populations associated with antitumor immunity and enhances cell-killing pathways. However, the analysis also uncovers the presence of immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells in the TME after YM101 treatment. To overcome this hurdle, YM101 is combined with Maraviroc, a widely used CCR5 antagonist for treating HIV infection, suppressing CCR5+ T cell accumulation, and optimizing the immune response. Mechanistically, YM101-induced neutrophil activation recruits immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells via CCR5 ligand secretion, creating a feedback loop that diminishes the antitumor response. Maraviroc then cleared these infiltrating cells and offset YM101-mediated immunosuppressive effects, further unleashing the antitumor immunity. These findings suggest selectively targeting CCR5 signaling with Maraviroc represents a promising and strategic approach to enhance YM101 efficacy.">

        <tr id="Leukemia is a prevalent pediatric life-threatening hematologic malignancy with a poor prognosis. Targeting immune checkpoints (ICs) to reverse T cell exhaustion is a potentially effective treatment for leukemia. Tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells have been found to predict the efficacy of programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor (anti-PD-1) therapy in solid tumors. However, the IC characteristics of TRM cells in leukemia and their relationship with prognosis remain unclear.We employed multi-color flow cytometry to evaluate the frequencies of CD103+CD4+ and CD103+CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to healthy individuals. We examined the expression patterns of PD-1 and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) within the circulating CD103+ T cell subsets affected by leukemia. To further elucidate the immunological landscape, we assessed the differentiation status of CD103+ T cells across various disease states in patients with leukemia.Our findings showed a significant increase in the frequency of CD103+CD8+ T cells in the PB of patients with leukemia who had achieved complete remission (CR) compared to those in the de novo (DN) and relapsed/refractory (RR) stages. This increase was accompanied by a notable decrease in the expression levels of PD-1 and TIGIT in CD103+CD8+ T cells in the CR stage. Additionally, our analysis revealed a higher proportion of CD103+CD8+ T cells in the central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) subsets of the immune profile. Notably, the proportions of CD103+ naïve T cells, CD103+ TEM, and CD103+ terminally differentiated T cells within the CD8+ T cell population were significantly elevated in patients with CR compared to those in the DN/RR stages.The data indicate that circulating higher frequency of CD103+CD8+ T cells with lower expression of PD-1 and TIGIT are associated with favorable outcomes in patients with leukemia. This suggests a potential role of TRM cells in leukemia prognosis and provides a foundation for developing targeted immunotherapies.">

Here, we show that mature IL-18 is generated in the thymus following numerous distinct forms of tissue damage, all of which cause caspase-1-mediated immunogenic cell death. We report that IL-18 stimulated cytotoxic NK cells limit endogenous thymic regeneration, a critical process that ensures restoration of immune competence after acute insults like stress, infection, chemotherapy, and radiation. NK cells suppressed thymus recovery by aberrantly targeting thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which act as the master regulators of organ function and regeneration. Together these studies reveal a novel pathway regulating tissue regeneration in the thymus and offer IL-18 as a potential therapeutic target to boost thymic function. Moreover, given the enthusiasm for IL-18 as a cancer immunotherapy for its capacity to elicit a type-1 immune response, these findings also offer insight into potential off-target effects.">

        <tr id="In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pro-tumoral macrophages promote metastasis and suppress the immune response. To target these cells, we engineered a previously identified CD206 (mannose receptor)-binding peptide, mUNO, to enhance its affinity and proteolytic stability. The new rationally designed peptide, MACTIDE, includes a trypsin inhibitor loop, from the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor-I. Binding studies to recombinant CD206 revealed a 15-fold lower KD for MACTIDE compared to parental mUNO. Additionally, mass spectrometry showed a 5-fold increase in half-life in tumor lysate for MACTIDE compared to mUNO. Homing studies in TNBC-bearing mice showed that fluorescein (FAM)-MACTIDE precisely targeted CD206+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) upon intravenous, intraperitoneal and even oral administration, with no significant accumulation in liver. We coupled MACTIDE to the FDA-approved drug Verteporfin, an established photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy and inhibitor of the YAP/TAZ pathway, to generate a conjugate here referred to as MACTIDE-V. In the orthotopic 4T1 TNBC mouse model, non-irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice unexpectedly showed a similar anti-tumoral effect and fewer signs of toxicity as irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice, leading to subsequent studies on the laser-independent activity of this conjugate. In vitro studies using bone-marrow derived mouse macrophages showed that MACTIDE-V excluded YAP from the nucleus, increased the phagocytic activity and upregulated several genes associated with cytotoxic anti-tumoral macrophages. In mouse models of TNBC, MACTIDE-V slowed primary tumor growth, suppressed lung metastases, increased markers of phagocytosis and antigen presentation in TAMs and monocytes, increasing the tumor infiltration of several lymphocyte subsets. We therefore propose MACTIDE-V as a useful peptide-drug conjugate to modulate macrophage function in the context of breast tumor immunotherapy.">

Within the TME, cell-to-cell inhibitory interactions play significant roles in dampening their anti-tumor activities. Recent studies have revealed that soluble factors released in the TME by immune and non-immune cells, as well as by tumor cells themselves, contribute to the exacerbation of T cell exhaustion. Our understanding of the cytokine landscape of the TME, their interrelationships, and their impact on cancer development is still at its early stages. In this review, we aim to shed light on Interleukin (IL) -6, IL-9, and IL-10, a small group of JAK/STAT signaling-dependent cytokines harboring T cell-suppressive effects in the TME and summarize their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we will explore how advancements in scientific research can help us overcoming the obstacles posed by cytokines that suppress T cells in tumors, with the ultimate objective of stimulating further investigations for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract their tumor-promoting activities.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cell activation leads to the rapid proliferation and differentiation of effector T cells (Teffs), which mediate antitumor immunity. Although aerobic glycolysis is preferentially activated in CD8+ Teffs, the mechanisms that regulate CD8+ T cell glucose uptake in the low-glucose and acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the abundance of the glucose transporter GLUT10 is increased during CD8+ T cell activation and antitumor immunity. Specifically, GLUT10 deficiency inhibited glucose uptake, glycolysis, and antitumor efficiency of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Supplementation with glucose alone was insufficient to rescue the antitumor function and glucose uptake of CD8+ T cells in the TME. By analyzing tumor environmental metabolites, we found that high concentrations of lactic acid reduced the glucose uptake, activation, and antitumor effects of CD8+ T cells by directly binding to GLUT10’s intracellular motif. Disrupting the interaction of lactic acid and GLUT10 by the mimic peptide PG10.3 facilitated CD8+ T cell glucose utilization, proliferation, and antitumor functions. The combination of PG10.3 and GLUT1 inhibition or anti–programmed cell death 1 antibody treatment showed synergistic antitumor effects. Together, our data indicate that GLUT10 is selectively required for glucose uptake of CD8+ T cells and identify that TME accumulated lactic acid inhibits CD8+ T cell effector function by directly binding to GLUT10 and reducing its glucose transport capacity. Last, our study suggests disrupting lactate-GLUT10 binding as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance CD8+ T cell–mediated antitumor effects. GLUT10 enhances glucose uptake in CD8+ T cells to improve antitumor function. Editor’s summary CD8+ T cells are a critical part of antitumor immunity and depend on metabolites including glucose to maintain their function. Here, Liu et al. have evaluated targeting glucose transport 10 (GLUT10) as a way to increase CD8+ T cell function by disrupting the competitive binding of lactic acid that increased glucose uptake, thereby increasing proliferation and antitumor capacity. Authors developed a mimic peptide, PG10.3, to treat mouse models alone or in combination with anti–programmed cell death 1 to improve antitumor effects. This represents a new potential therapeutic option to improve outcomes for patients undergoing immunotherapy that will require further study. —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="The mucosal immune system is a critical first line of defense to infectious diseases, as many pathogens enter the body through mucosal surfaces, disrupting the balanced interactions between mucosal cells, secretory molecules, and microbiota in this challenging microenvironment. The mucosal immune system comprises of a complex and integrated network that includes the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). One of its primary responses to microbes is the secretion of IgA, whose role in the mucosa is vital for preventing pathogen colonization, invasion and spread. The mechanisms involved in these key responses include neutralization of pathogens, immune exclusion, immune modulation, and cross-protection. The generation and maintenance of high affinity IgA responses require a delicate balance of multiple components, including B and T cell interactions, innate cells, the cytokine milieu (e.g., IL-21, IL-10, TGF-β), and other factors essential for intestinal homeostasis, including the gut microbiota. In this review, we will discuss the main cellular components (e.g., T cells, innate lymphoid cells, dendritic cells) in the gut microenvironment as mediators of important effector responses and as critical players in supporting B cells in eliciting and maintaining IgA production, particularly in the context of enteric infections and vaccination in humans. Understanding the mechanisms of humoral and cellular components in protection could guide and accelerate the development of more effective mucosal vaccines and therapeutic interventions to efficiently combat mucosal infections.">

        <tr id="Background The understanding of alterations within the immune system following doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, and subsequent restoration, in childhood cancer survivors remains limited. This investigation endeavors to elucidate the immediate and delayed changes in thymic immune cell populations and their phenotypes in response to clinically relevant low doses of DOX in a juvenile mouse model. Methods Male mice underwent a regimen of repeated low-dose DOX intraperitoneal injections at 4 mg/kg/week for three consecutive weeks. One week after the last dose of DOX, a subset of mice was euthanized to assess the immediate effects of DOX administration. A second subset of mice was euthanized five weeks after the last DOX dose to evaluate the delayed effects. Thymic samples were collected for multiparameter flow cytometry analysis to evaluate alterations in immune cell composition and phenotype. Additionally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to measure gene expression of- cytokines and senescence markers. Results One week following DOX administration, DOX treatment resulted in significant decline in thymus weight, with notable alterations in immune cell subpopulations. Reduced frequencies of mature CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells were observed, along with changes in proliferation and exhaustion markers. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of Foxn, Pax1, Ifnγ, and Il7 alongside decreased Il6 and Il17 expression. Furthermore, Cdkn1a (p21Cip1) expression was elevated, suggesting immunosenescence. Five weeks following DOX administration, delayed effects of DOX treatment manifested in rebound increase in thymus weight and altered frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, with distinct patterns of proliferation and exhaustion observed. Notably, central memory CD4+ T cells exhibited significant decrease in frequency, while naïve and effector memory CD4+ T cells showed reduced proliferation (Ki67+) and PD1 expression. Similar trends were observed in CD8+ T cell subsets, indicating selective effects of DOX on T cell differentiation and function. Although expression of thymus-related genes was normalized, p21Cip1 gene expression remained elevated. Conclusion DOX treatment elicits a multifaceted influence on immune cell subsets and thymic weight. Immediate effects included thymic atrophy and reductions in mature T cell populations, while delayed effects showed rebound thymic hyperplasia and selective changes in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. Notably, both central memory and effector memory T cells exhibited reduced proliferation and exhaustion, suggesting unique impacts of DOX on immune cell function. The enduring elevation in p21Cip1 gene expression 5 weeks after DOX treatment suggests an immunosenescent phenotype. These observations collectively illuminate the formidable task of preserving immune competence and overall well-being in childhood cancer survivors subjected to DOX therapy.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is a key phenomenon in understanding tumor recurrence, metastasis, and other critical steps in tumor progression. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is in constant flux due to the tumor’s ability to release signals that affect it, while immune cells within it can impact cancer cell behavior. Cancer cells undergo several changes, which can change the enrichment of different immune cells and modulate the activity of existing immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating antigen presentation or expressing immune checkpoint molecules. High levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlate with better outcomes, and robust immune responses can control tumor growth. On the contrary, increased enrichment of Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages can hinder effective immune surveillance and predict poor prognosis. Overall, understanding these immune evasion mechanisms guides therapeutic strategies. Researchers aim to modulate the TME to enhance immune surveillance and improve patient outcomes. In this review article, we strive to summarize the composition of the tumor immune microenvironment, factors affecting the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and different therapeutic modalities targeting the immune cells. This review is a first-hand reference to understand the basics of immune surveillance and immune evasion.">

NKT1 cells are susceptible to ARTC2-mediated P2X7 receptor (P2RX7) activation, but the effects on other unconventional T-cell types are unknown. Here, we show that MAIT, γδT, and NKT cells express P2RX7 and are sensitive to P2RX7-mediated cell death. Mouse peripheral T-bet+ MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells, especially in liver, co-express ARTC2 and P2RX7, which can be further upregulated by retinoic acid. Blocking ARTC2 or inhibiting P2RX7 protected MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells from cell death, enhanced their survival in vivo, and increased the number of IFN-γ-secreting cells without affecting IL-17 production. Importantly, this revealed the existence of IFN-γ and IL-4 co-producing unconventional T-cell populations normally lost upon isolation due to ARTC2/P2RX7-induced death. Administering extracellular NAD in vivo activated this pathway, depleting P2RX7-sensitive unconventional T cells. Our study reveals ARTC2/P2RX7 as a common regulatory axis modulating the unconventional T-cell compartment, affecting the viability of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing T cells, offering important insights to facilitate future studies into how these cells can be regulated in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) accumulate in the majority of solid tumors, producing inflammatory cytokines and growth factors involved in tumor maintenance. They have recently emerged as targets for restoring an effective antitumor response and limiting tumor growth. In the present study, we investigated the potential of IL-27 neutralization to modify macrophage polarization and thus the tumor immune microenvironment. We monitored the effect of IL-27 neutralization on human macrophages and in vivo in a murine colon adenocarcinoma model. In this study, we demonstrated the importance of IL-27 in the generation of human immunoregulatory macrophages. Mechanistically, IL-27 neutralization reduced the immunosuppressive properties of macrophages. These modifications led to a reduction in the ability of macrophages to inhibit the function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of IL-27 reduced MC38 tumor growth. Collectively, we uncovered the role of IL-27 in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. IL-27 neutralization thus appears as a promising strategy to target macrophages in immunosuppressive TME and improve the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy protocols.">

        <tr id="Reduced responsiveness of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) to chemotherapy can be first detected in the form of minimal residual disease leukemia cells that persist after 28 days of initial treatment. The ability of these cells to resist chemotherapy is partly due to the microenvironment of the bone marrow, which promotes leukemia cell growth and provides protection, particularly under these conditions of stress. It is unknown if and how the glycocalyx of such cells is remodelled during the development of tolerance to drug treatment, even though glycosylation is the most abundant cell surface post-translational modification present on the plasma membrane. To investigate this, we performed omics analysis of BCP-ALL cells that survived a 30-day vincristine chemotherapy treatment while in co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells. Proteomics showed decreased levels of some metabolic enzymes. Overall glycocalyx changes included a shift from Core-2 to less complex Core-1 O-glycans, and reduced overall sialylation, with a shift from α2-6 to α2-3 linked Neu5Ac. Interestingly, there was a clear increase in bisecting complex N-glycans with a concomitant increased mRNA expression of MGAT3, the only enzyme known to form bisecting N-glycans. These small but reproducible quantitative differences suggest that individual glycoproteins become differentially glycosylated. Glycoproteomics confirmed glycosite-specific modulation of cell surface and lysosomal proteins in drug-tolerant BCP-ALL cells, including HLA-DRA, CD38, LAMP1 and PPT1. We conclude that drug-tolerant persister leukemia cells that grow under continuous chemotherapy stress have characteristic glycotraits that correlate with and perhaps contribute to their ability to survive and could be tested as neoantigens in drug-resistant leukemia.">

Here, we demonstrate that navitoclax, an orally bioavailable, small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, significantly improves pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) treatments as a host-directed therapy. Addition of navitoclax to standard TB treatments at human equipotent dosing in mouse models of TB, inhibits Bcl-2 expression, leading to improved bacterial clearance, reduced tissue damage / fibrosis and decreased extrapulmonary bacterial dissemination. Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we show that navitoclax induces apoptosis in several immune cells, including CD68 + and CD11b + cells. Finally, positron emission tomography (PET) in live animals using novel, clinically translatable biomarkers for apoptosis (18F-ICMT-11) and fibrosis (18F-FAPI-74) demonstrates that navitoclax significantly increases apoptosis and reduces fibrosis in pulmonary tissues, which are confirmed using post-mortem studies. Our studies suggest that proapoptotic drugs such as navitoclax can improve pulmonary TB treatments, and should be evaluated in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the leading infectious causes of death worldwide. There is no available licensed therapeutic vaccine that shortens active tuberculosis (TB) disease drug treatment and prevents relapse, despite the World Health Organization’s calls. Here, we show that an intranasal DNA vaccine containing a fusion of the stringent response relMtb gene with the gene encoding the immature dendritic cell-targeting chemokine, MIP-3α/CCL20, shortens the duration of curative TB treatment in immunocompetent mice. Compared to the first-line regimen for drug-susceptible TB alone, our novel adjunctive vaccine induced greater RelMtb-specific T-cell responses associated with optimal TB control in spleen, blood, lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. These responses were sustained, if not augmented, over time. It also triggered more effective dendritic cell recruitment, activation, and colocalization with T cells, implying enhanced crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, it potentiated a 6-month TB drug-resistant regimen, rendering it effective across treatment regimens, and also showed promising results in CD4+ knockout mice, perhaps due to enhanced Rel-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Notably, our novel fusion vaccine was also immunogenic in nonhuman primates, the gold standard animal model for TB vaccine studies, eliciting antigen-specific T-cell responses in blood and BAL fluid analogous to those observed in protected mice. Our findings have critical implications for therapeutic TB vaccine clinical development in immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations and may serve as a model for defining immunological correlates of therapeutic vaccine-induced protection.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) are widely held to drive tissue damage, yet the specific roles of central nervous system (CNS)- resident versus CNS-invading MPs remain unclear. Here, by combining single-cell profiling with conditional gene targeting, we systematically dissected and interfered with ROS production across CNS MPs in a preclinical model for neuroinflammation. We show that CNS-invading monocyte derived cells (MdCs) exhibit a higher oxidative stress gene signature and produce more ROS compared to CNS-resident microglia. While NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a phagocytic source of ROS, proved redundant, our findings underscore the critical role of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in driving oxidative tissue damage. Quenching mtROS through mitocatalase overexpression in MdCs, but not microglia, significantly alleviated neuroinflammation in mice. Thus, our study resolves a longstanding controversy, identifying MdCs as the primary driver of ROS-mediated neuropathology.">

We identified crater-shaped pockets at the margins of zebrafish and human melanoma, rich with beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and antigen recognition molecules. The craters harbor the highest density of CD8+ T cells in the tumor. In zebrafish, CD8+ T cells formed prolonged interactions with melanoma cells within craters, characteristic of antigen recognition. Following immunostimulatory treatment, the craters enlarged and became the major site of activated CD8+ T cell accumulation and tumor killing that was B2M dependent. In humans, craters predicted immune response to ICB therapy, showing response better than high T cell infiltration. This marks craters as potential new diagnostic tool for immunotherapy success and targets to enhance ICB response.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

        <tr id="In the dynamic landscape of cervical cancer (CC) pathophysiology, this study aimed to elucidate the role of necroptosis in modulating tumor proliferation, invasion, and the immune microenvironment in CC. In this study, the impact of necroptosis on CC was evaluated through a series of bioinformatical analyses and experimental approaches. The impact of necroptosis on CC was illustrated by analyzing its effects on tumor aggression, immune responses, and the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was also evaluated for its potential induction of necroptosis in CC cells and its interaction with necroptosis inhibitors. Additionally, the study assessed the influence of necroptosis on the immune microenvironment, particularly in T-cell-related pathways and the expression of tumor suppressor genes in CC. Necroptosis was found to enhance VEGFA expression through the activation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, promoting tumor proliferative and invasive capabilities in CC. Bevacizumab induced necroptosis in CC cells, potentially leading to resistance to therapy. The combination of bevacizumab with necroptosis inhibitors attenuated VEGFA expression, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy. Additionally, necroptosis activated T-cell-related pathways and promoted the infiltration and activation of Jurkat T cells. CD3D—a tumor suppressor gene in CC—was identified as a critical marker and its expression could be upregulated by necroptosis via the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in Jurkat T cells. Treatment of CC cells with supernatants from necroptosis-induced Jurkat cells resulted in reduced tumor cell proliferation and invasion. This study reveals a complex interaction between necroptosis, tumor progression, and the immune response in CC. The findings propose a nuanced approach to leveraging necroptosis for therapeutic interventions, highlighting the potential of combining necroptosis inhibitors with existing therapies to improve treatment outcomes in CC.">

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) triggers an immune response that contributes to anti-tumor effects. Induction of interferon beta (IFN-β) is a key event in this immunogenicity of RT. We have previously shown that TRIM33, a chromatin reader, restrains IFN-β expression in Toll-like receptor-activated myeloid cells. Here, we explored whether deleting Trim33 in myeloid cells might improve the radio-induced immune response, and subsequent efficiency of RT. We first established that Trim33-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages showed increased expression of IFN-β in response to direct irradiation, or to treatment with irradiated cancer cells, further supporting our hypothesis. We then tested the efficiency of a single dose RT in three subcutaneous and one orthotopic tumor models. In all situations, myeloid deletion of Trim33 led to a significantly improved response after RT, leading to a complete and durable response in most of the treated mice bearing orthotopic oral tumors. This effect required the IFN-I pathway, and the presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes, but not NK cells. In addition, cured mice were capable of rejecting a secondary tumor challenge, demonstrating an in situ vaccination effect. We conclude that deleting Trim33 in myeloid cells improves RT efficiency, through a mechanism involving the IFN-I pathway and the immune response. Our work suggests that myeloid Trim33 is a host factor affecting the tumor response to RT, thus representing a new potential therapeutic target for modifying RT responses.">

These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell-mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer presents as an immunologically "cold" malignancy, characterized by a lack of response to immunotherapy in the majority of patients. The dysfunction of prostate tumor metabolism is recognized as a critical factor in immune evasion, resulting in reduced effectiveness of immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite this awareness, the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning metabolic dysregulation in prostate cancer and its intricate relationship with immune evasion remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, we introduce the multi-drug resistance protein ABCC4/MRP4 as a key player prominently expressed in prostate cancer, exerting a pivotal role in suppressing the activity of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Depletion of ABCC4 in prostate cancer cells halts the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a molecule that diminishes the population of CD8+ T cells and curtails their cytotoxic capabilities. Conversely, constraining the activation of PGE2 signaling in CD8+ T cells effectively improved the efficacy of prostate cancer treatment with PD-1 blockade. During this process, downregulation of the JAK1-STAT3 pathway and depolarization of mitochondria emerge as crucial factors contributing to T cell anergy. Collectively, our research identifies the ABCC4-PGE2 axis as a promising target for reversing dysfunction within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and augmenting the suboptimal responsiveness to immunotherapy in prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to unprecedented success in treating relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The most common CAR-T cell products currently in the clinic for DLBCL differ in their co-stimulation moiety, containing either CD28 or 4-1BB, which initiate distinct signalling pathways. Previous work has highlighted the importance of T cell metabolism in fuelling anti-cancer function. We have studied the metabolic characteristics induced by CD28 versus 4-1BB co-stimulation in patient CAR-T cells ex vivo. Our data show that in patients, CD28 and 4-1BB drive significantly divergent metabolic profiles. CD28 signalling endows T cells with a preferentially glycolytic metabolism supporting an effector phenotype and increased expansion capacity, while 4-1BB co-stimulation preserves mitochondrial fitness and results in memory-like differentiation. Despite this divergent programming, T cells in patients responding successfully to therapy were metabolically similar, irrespective of co-stimulator, suggesting that efficient fuelling of CAR-T cells in lymphoma requires a ‘balanced’ metabolism. In contrast, CAR-T cells in non-responders were pushed to their metabolic extremes.

        <tr id="Introduction Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant and influential elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME), giving support to tumor development in multiple ways. Among other mechanisms, CAFs are important regulators of immunological processes occurring in tumors. However, CAF-mediated tumor immunomodulation in the context of radiotherapy remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore effects of radiation on CAF-derived immunoregulatory signals to the TME. Methods Primary CAF cultures were established from freshly collected human NSCLC lung tumors. CAFs were exposed to single-high or fractionated radiation regimens (1x18Gy or 3x6Gy), and the expression of different immunoregulatory cell-associated and secreted signaling molecules was analyzed 48h and 6 days after initiation of treatment. Analyses included quantitative measurements of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), interferon (IFN) type I responses, expression of immune regulatory receptors, and secretion of soluble cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. CAFs are able to survive ablative radiation regimens, however they enter into a stage of premature cell senescence. Results Our data show that CAFs avoid apoptosis and do not contribute by release of DAMPs or IFN-I secretion to radiation-mediated tumor immunoregulation. Furthermore, the secretion of relevant immunoregulatory cytokines and growth factors including TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IL-1β, VEGF, CXCL12, and CXCL10 remain comparable between non-irradiated and radiation-induced senescent CAFs. Importantly, radiation exposure modifies the cell surface expression of some key immunoregulatory receptors, including upregulation of CD73 and CD276. Discussion Our data suggest that CAFs do not participate in the release of danger signals or IFN-I secretion following radiotherapy. The immune phenotype of CAFs and radiation-induced senescent CAFs is similar, however, the observed elevation of some cell surface immunological receptors on irradiated CAFs could contribute to the establishment of an enhanced immunosuppressive TME after radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Lifelong hematopoiesis is sustained by crosstalk between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and specialized bone marrow niches. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) upends that balance, as leukemic blasts secrete factors that remodel the bone marrow into a self-reinforcing leukemic niche. The inflammatory secretome behind this compartmental adaptation accounts for a progressive decline in hematopoietic function that leads to diagnosis and persists through early treatment. Not surprisingly, the mediators of an acute inflammatory injury and HSPC suppression have attracted much attention in an effort to alleviate morbidity and improve outcomes. HSPCs typically recover during disease remission and re-expand in the bone marrow (BM), but little is known about potentially lasting consequences for stem cells and progenitors. We recently showed that AML-experienced HSPCs actively participate in the inflammatory process during leukemic progression. HSPCs are constituent components of the innate immune system, and elegant studies of infection and experimental inflammation over the past decade have described the generation of an adoptively transferable, innate immune memory. Building on this paradigm, we discuss the potential translational relevance of a durable legacy in AML-experienced HSPC.">

CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy.

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with a strong chronic inflammatory component. One possible strategy for the treatment of T1D is to stimulate the regulatory arm of the immune response, i.e. to promote the function of tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC) and regulatory T cells (Treg). Since both cell types have been shown to be responsive to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation, we used a recently characterized member of a new class of fluorescent AHR ligands, AGT-5, to modulate streptozotocin-induced T1D in C57BL/6 mice. Prophylactic oral administration of AGT-5 reduced hyperglycemia and insulitis in these mice. Phenotypic and functional analysis of cells in the pancreatic infiltrates of AGT-5-treated mice (at the early phase of T1D) revealed a predominantly anti-inflammatory environment, as evidenced by the upregulation of tolDC and Treg frequency, while CD8+ cell, Th1 and Th17 cells were significantly reduced. Similarly, AGT-5 enhanced the proportion of Treg and tolDC in small intestine lamina propria and suppressed the activation status of antigen-presenting cells through down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. The expression levels of Cyp1a1, controlled by the AHR, were increased in CD4+, CD8+ and Treg, confirming the AHR-mediated effect of AGT-5 in these cells. Finally, AGT-5 stimulated the function of regulatory cells in the pancreatic islets and lamina propria by upregulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase 1 (IDO1) in tolDC. These findings were supported by the abrogation of AGT-5-mediated in vitro effects on DC in the presence of IDO1 inhibitor. AGT-5 also increased the expression of CD39 or CD73 ATP-degrading ectoenzymes by Treg. The increase in Treg is further supported by the upregulated frequency of IL-2-producing type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the lamina propria. Anti-inflammatory effects of AGT-5 were also validated on human tonsil cells, where in vitro exposure to AGT-5 increased the proportion of immunosuppressive dendritic cells and ILC3. These results suggest that AGT-5, by stimulating AHR, may promote a general immunosuppressive environment in the pancreas and small intestine lamina propria at the early phase of disease, and thereby inhibit the severity of T1D in mice.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular events seem to occur more frequently after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests a possible role of immune checkpoints in accelerating atherosclerosis formation. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of soluble and membrane-bound immune checkpoints in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We assessed the levels of 14 soluble immune checkpoints in fasting blood plasma of PAD patients (intermittent claudication, n= 37) and healthy controls (HCs, n=39) by Multiplex protein assay. We measured the levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1/2), B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), glucocorticoid-induced TNRF-related protein (GITR), herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), CD28, CD27, CD80, CD137 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). The surface expression of CD28, PD-L2, PD-1, GITR, LAG-3, TIM-3 and BTLA on peripheral blood immune cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine production capacity was measured by flow cytometry in TIM-3+ T cells to determine immune exhaustion. Soluble levels of PD-L2 were decreased in PAD patients, but only in females, whereas soluble levels of TIM-3 showed a trend towards increased concentration in female PAD patients. All monocyte subsets had increased frequencies of PD-L2+ cells in PAD patients. CD4+ T cells had increased frequencies of TIM-3+ cells, which showed little overlap with other immune exhaustion markers. TIM-3+ CD4+ T cells appeared to have a low capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, but a higher capacity to produce IL-10 compared to TIM-3-CD4+ T cells. We found that PAD patients show differences in expression of both membrane-bound and soluble immune checkpoints. Some of these differences might be caused by prolonged immune activation, although immune exhaustion markers did not always overlap.">

        <tr id="One of the main causes of poor prognoses in patient with glioblastoma (GBM) is drug resistance to current standard treatment, which includes chemoradiation and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). In addition, the concept of cancer stem cells provides new insights into therapy resistance and management also in GBM and glioblastoma stem cell-like cells (GSCs), which might contribute to therapy resistance. Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) stimulates astroglial differentiation of GSCs and thereby reduces their self-renewal capacity. Exposure of GSCs to BMP4 may also sensitize these cells to TMZ. A recent phase I trial has shown that local delivery of BMP4 is safe, but a large variation in survival is seen in these treated patients and in features of their cultured tumors. We wanted to combine TMZ and BMP4 (TMZ + BMP4) therapy and assess the inter-tumoral variability in response to TMZ + BMP4 in patient-derived GBM cultures. A phase II trial could then benefit a larger group of patients than those treated with BMP4 only. We first show that simultaneous treatment with TMZ + BMP4 is more effective than sequential treatment. Second, when applying our optimized treatment protocol, 70% of a total of 20 GBM cultures displayed TMZ + BMP4 synergy. This combination induces cellular apoptosis and does not inhibit cell proliferation. Comparative bulk RNA-sequencing indicates that treatment with TMZ + BMP4 eventually results in decreased MAPK signaling, in line with previous evidence that increased MAPK signaling is associated with resistance to TMZ. Based on these results, we advocate further clinical trial research to test patient benefit and validate pathophysiological hypothesis.">

        <tr id="Introduction The role of zinc (Zn) in tumor development and immune modulation has always been paradoxical. This study redefines our understanding of the impact of Zn on cancer progression and therapeutic strategies. Methods We investigated the effects of dietary Zn levels on tumor progression and immune responses. This included examining the impact of both high and deficient dietary Zn, as well as Zn chelation, on tumor growth and immune cell populations. Specifically, we analyzed the frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and identified the role of FOXO1 in Zn-mediated effects on Tregs. Additionally, we explored the therapeutic potential of clioquinol (CQ) in enhancing α-PD-1 immunotherapy responses, particularly in melanoma. Results Our findings show that high dietary Zn promotes tumor progression by fostering a protumorigenic environment mediated by T cells. Increased Zn intake was found to facilitate tumor progression by increasing Foxp3+ Treg frequency. In contrast, deficiency in dietary Zn and chelation of tissue Zn emerged as potent drivers of antitumor immunity. We pinpointed FOXO1 as the master regulator governing the influence of Zn on Tregs. Discussion These results reveal a novel mechanistic insight into how Zn influences tumor progression and immune regulation. The identification of FOXO1 as a key regulator opens new avenues for understanding the role of Zn in cancer biology. Furthermore, we introduce a promising therapeutic approach by showing that administering clioquinol (CQ) significantly enhances α-PD-1 immunotherapy response, particularly in melanoma. These revelations transform our comprehension of the multifaceted role of Zn in tumorigenesis and immune regulation, highlighting innovative possibilities for cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="The abnormal tumor vasculature acts as the physical and functional barrier to the infiltration and activity of effector T cells, leading to the low response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Herein, antiangiogenic extracellular vesicles that enable normalization of the tumor-associated vasculature were prepared to potentiate the efficacy of ICIs. Small extracellular vesicles were exploited as the delivery platform to protect the antiangiogenic protein, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), from proteolytic degradation. Along with the physicochemical characteristics of the PEDF-enriched extracellular vesicles (P-EVs), their inhibitory effects on migration, proliferation, and tube formation of endothelial cells were investigated in vitro. In tumor-bearing mice, it was confirmed that, compared to bare PEDFs, P-EVs efficiently reduced vessel leakiness, improved blood perfusion, and attenuated hypoxia. Consequently, when combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies, P-EVs remarkably augmented the antitumor immunity, as evidenced by increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and reduced regulatory T cells. These results suggest that P-EVs are promising therapeutics for tumors refractory to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Background: Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) induced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection plays an important role in resistance to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in EBV-associated epithelial cancers; however, the interaction between VM and the immune microenvironment has not been systematically investigated. Methods: IHC and multiplex IHC analysis the relationships among tumour-associated macrophage (TAM), VM and EBV infection in EBV-associated epithelial cancer biopsies. In vitro and in vivo evidence using CRISPR-Cas9 system engineered EBV-infected epithelial cancer cells and mouse models support functional role and mechanism for M2c-like macrophages in the VM formation. The prediction of VM in the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic agent was analysed using clinical datasets. Results: EBV-associated epithelial cancer biopsies revealed that infiltration of the TAM surrounding the VM is closely associated with EBV infection. AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway in EBV-infected epithelial cancer cells control the secretion of CCL5 and CSF-1, enabling the recruitment of monocytes and their differentiation into M2c macrophages which promote VM formation by MMP9. Combination of anti-angiogenesis agents and HIF-1α inhibitor caused marked decreases in CD31-positive micro-vessels, VM, and M2c-like macrophages. VM scores can be used as biomarkers to predict the efficacy of anti-angiogenic agent therapy in EBV-associated epithelial cancers. Conclusions: Our findings define a secretory cross-talk between tumour cells and the immune microenvironment in EBV-associated epithelial cancer, revealing an unexpected role of EBV in epithelial cancer cells, controlling VM formation via M2c-like macrophages.">

        <tr id="The bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) has highly specialized anatomical characteristics that provide a sanctuary place for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that allow appropriate proliferation, maintenance, and self-renewal capacity. Several cell types contribute to the constitution and function of the bone marrow niche. Interestingly, uncovering the secrets of BMM and its interaction with HSCs in health paved the road for research aiming at better understanding the concept of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and their altered niche. In fact, they share many signals that are responsible for interactions between LSCs and the bone marrow niche, due to several biological similarities between LSCs and HSCs. On the other hand, LSCs differ from HSCs in their abnormal activation of important signaling pathways that regulate survival, proliferation, drug resistance, invasion, and spread. Targeting these altered niches can help in better treatment choices for hematological malignancies and bone marrow disorders in general and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in particular. Moreover, targeting those niches may help in decreasing the emergence of drug resistance and lower the relapse rate. In this article, the authors reviewed the most recent literature on bone marrow niches and their relations with either normal HSCs and AML cells/LSC, by focusing on pathogenetic and therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="T cells rewire their metabolic activities to meet the demand of immune responses, but how to coordinate the immune response by metabolic regulators in activated T cells is unknown. Here, we identified autocrine VEGF-B as a metabolic regulator to control lipid synthesis and maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane for the survival of activated T cells. Disruption of autocrine VEGF-B signaling in T cells reduced cardiolipin mass, resulting in mitochondrial damage, with increased apoptosis and reduced memory development. The addition of cardiolipin or modulating VEGF-B signaling improved T cell mitochondrial fitness and survival. Autocrine VEGF-B signaling through GA-binding protein α (GABPα) induced sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2) expression, which further de-SUMOylated PPARγ and enhanced phospholipid synthesis, leading to a cardiolipin increase in activated T cells. These data suggest that autocrine VEGF-B mediates a signal to coordinate lipid synthesis and mitochondrial fitness with T cell activation for survival and immune response. Moreover, autocrine VEGF-B signaling in T cells provides a therapeutic target against infection and tumors as well as an avenue for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="HIV-induced persistent immune activation is a key mediator of inflammatory comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurocognitive disorders. While a preponderance of data indicate that gut barrier disruption and microbial translocation are drivers of chronic immune activation, the molecular mechanisms of this persistent inflammatory state remain poorly understood. Here, utilizing the nonhuman primate model of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection with suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), we investigated activation of inflammasome pathways and their association with intestinal epithelial barrier disruption (IEBD). Longitudinal blood samples obtained from rhesus macaques with chronic SIV infection and long-term suppressive ART were evaluated for IEBD biomarkers, inflammasome activation (IL-1β and IL-18), inflammatory cytokines, and triglyceride (TG) levels. Activated monocyte subpopulations and glycolytic potential were investigated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). During the chronic phase of treated SIV infection, elevated levels of plasma IL-1β and IL-18 were observed following the hallmark increase in IEBD biomarkers, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and LPS-binding protein (LBP). Further, significant correlations of plasma IFABP levels with IL-1β and IL-18 were observed between 10 and 12 months of ART. Higher levels of sCD14, IL-6, and GM-CSF, among other inflammatory mediators, were also observed only during the long-term SIV + ART phase along with a trend of increase in the frequencies of activated CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocyte subpopulations. Lastly, we found elevated levels of blood TG and higher glycolytic capacity in PBMCs of chronic SIV-infected macaques with long-term ART. The increase in circulating IL-18 and IL-1β following IEBD and their significant positive correlation with IFABP suggest a connection between gut barrier disruption and inflammasome activation during chronic SIV infection, despite viral suppression with ART. Additionally, the increase in markers of monocyte activation, along with elevated TG and enhanced glycolytic pathway activity, indicates metabolic remodeling that could fuel metabolic syndrome. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which gut dysfunction and inflammasome activation contribute to HIV-associated metabolic complications, enabling targeted interventions in people with HIV.">

Current CXCR4 inhibitors mobilize AML cells into the bloodstream where they become more chemosensitive have failed to improve patient survival, likely reflecting persistent receptor localization on target cells. Here we characterize the signaling properties of CXCL12-locked dimer (CXCL12-LD), a bioengineered variant of the dimeric CXCL12 structure. CXCL12-LD binding resulted in lower levels of G protein, β-arrestin, and intracellular calcium mobilization, consistent with the locked dimer being a partial agonist of CXCR4. Further, CXCL12-LD failed to induce chemotaxis in AML cells. Despite these partial agonist properties, CXCL12-LD increased CXCR4 internalization compared to wildtype and locked-monomer forms of CXCL12. Analysis of a previously published AML transcriptomic data showed CXCR4 positive AML cells co-express genes involved in chemoresistance and maintenance of a blast-like state. The CXCL12-LD partial agonist effectively mobilized stem cells into the bloodstream in mice suggesting a potential role for their use in targeting CXCR4. Together, our results suggest that enhanced internalization by CXCL12-LD partial agonist signaling can avoid pharmacodynamic tolerance and may identify new avenues to better target GPCRs.">

        <tr id="Currently, only 20-40% of cancer patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and characterizing dynamic changes in the immunological landscape during treatment are critical for improving responsiveness to immunotherapy. Here, we identified JNK signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a regulator of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bladder cancer treated with a JNK inhibitor revealed enhanced cytotoxicity and effector functions of CD8+ T cells. In untreated tumors, CAFs interacted frequently with CD8+ T cells and mediated their exhaustion. JNK inhibition abrogated the immunosuppression function of CAFs by downregulating the expression of TSLP, thereby restoring CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In addition, blockade of CAF-derived TSLP in combination with anti-PD1 treatment promoted tumor elimination by CD8+ T cells in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that JNK signaling plays an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment by promoting expression of TSLP in CAFs and suggest that inhibiting JNK signaling could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a prototypical autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to CD4+ T cells, memory B cells are now recognized as a critical cell type in the disease. This is underlined by the fact that the best-characterized environmental risk factor for MS is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can infect and persist in memory B cells throughout life. Several studies have identified changes in anti-EBV immunity in patients with MS. Examples include elevated titers of anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) antibodies, interactions of these with the MS-associated HLA-DR15 haplotype, and molecular mimicry with MS autoantigens like myelin basic protein (MBP), anoctamin-2 (ANO2), glial cell adhesion molecule (GlialCAM), and alpha-crystallin B (CRYAB). In this study, we employ a simple in vitro assay to examine the memory B cell antibody repertoire in MS patients and healthy controls. We replicate previous serological data from MS patients demonstrating an increased secretion of anti-EBNA1380-641 IgG in cell culture supernatants, as well as a positive correlation of these levels with autoantibodies against GlialCAM262-416 and ANO21-275. For EBNA1380-641 and ANO21-275, we provide additional evidence suggesting antibody cross-reactivity between the two targets. Further, we show that two efficacious MS treatments – natalizumab (NAT) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) – are associated with distinct changes in the EBNA1-directed B cell response and that these alterations can be attributed to the unique mechanisms of action of these therapies. Using an in vitro system, our study confirms MS-associated changes in the anti-EBNA1 memory B cell response, EBNA1380-641 antibody cross-reactivity with ANO21-275, and reveals treatment-associated changes in the immunoglobulin repertoire in MS.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with unclear pathogenesis and no effective treatments. We aimed to investigate a novel mechanistic theory and treat HAM patients with rituximab, which can deplete CD20+ B lymphocytes in circulation.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was analyzed to identify HTLV-1-associated B cells and their effect on T cells. An observational analysis of our HAM cohort was conducted to elucidate changes in the immunological microenvironment of these patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HAM patients were isolated to explore the efficacy of B cell depletion in vitro. To assess the effect of B-cell depletion on HAM patients, eligible participants in our cohort received rituximab therapy (NCT04004819).


RESULTS
ScRNA-seq results suggest a significant effect of HTLV-1-associated B cells on T cells. Additionally, HTLV-1 was found to infect B cells and depletion of B cells inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Number of B cells in HAM patients had positive correlation with the proviral load and infected cell counts. Depletion of B cells led to a reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load in vitro. Furthermore, in clinical trial, 14 HAM patients were enrolled. Three patients (21.4%) who received rituximab failed to achieve remission, compared to 24 (85.7%) patients received any other therapy that failed to achieve remission. With a low level of circulating B cells, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in CD4+ T cells fell.


INTERPRETATION
This study provided evidence that depleting B-lymphocytes is an innovative strategy for treating patients with HAM and broadens the understanding of the role of B cells in infectious immunity.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Lung cancer remains a major global health threat due to its complex microenvironment, particularly the role of neutrophils, which are crucial for tumor development and immune evasion mechanisms. This study aimed to delve into the impact of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil functions and their potential implications for lung cancer progression.


METHODS
Employing in vitro experimental models, this study has analyzed the effects of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil IL-8 and IFN-γ secretion, apoptosis, PD-L1 expression, and T-cell proliferation by using techniques, such as ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and CFSE proliferation assay. The roles of IL-8/PD-L1 in regulating neutrophil functions were further explored using inhibitors for IL-8 and PD-L1.


RESULTS
Lung cancer cell lines were found to secrete higher levels of IL-8 compared to normal lung epithelial cells. The conditioned media from lung cancer cells significantly reduced apoptosis in neutrophils, increased PD-L1 expression, and suppressed T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion. These effects were partially reversed in the presence of IL-8 inhibitors in Tumor Tissue Culture Supernatants (TTCS), while being further enhanced by IL-8. Both apoptosis and PD-L1 expression in neutrophils demonstrated dose-dependency to TTCS. Additionally, CFSE proliferation assay results further confirmed the inhibitory effect of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on T-cell proliferation.


CONCLUSION
This study has revealed lung cancer cell-conditioned media to modulate neutrophil functions through regulating factors, such as IL-8, thereby affecting immune regulation and tumor progression in the lung cancer microenvironment.">

 Background: Identification of effective immunomodulatory strategies remains a major unmet need in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (aCD40) exhibits direct cytotoxicity on tumor cells and augments antigen presentation. Subasumstat(SUB), a sumoylation inhibitor, augments innate and adaptive immune responses by increasing interferon signaling. We hypothesized that SUB+aCD40 combination would promote an effective antitumor immune response in an aggressive orthotopic model of PDAC. Methods: 2000 KPC 46 cells were implanted in the pancreas of four groups of F1 hybrid (initial survival, CD8+ T-cell depletion, and clodronate liposome depletion) and nude mice, enrolled when tumors had reached 3-5mm. The vehicle (veh) group received 80ul SUB vehicle (q48 hrs) and 100 ug blank IgG (qwk); SUB only group received 15mg/kg q48h; aCD40 only group received 100ug qwk; SUB+aCD40 group received 15mg/kg SUB q48h and 100 ug aCD40 qwk. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) was conducted on n=2 tumors from each group. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on veh and SUB+aCD40 tumors for macrophage infiltration using F4/80. Flow cytometry (FC) was employed for the presence of lymphoid and myeloid markers in veh, SUB+aCD40, and clodronate depleted SUB+aCD40 (SUB+aCD40+clod) groups. Results: Mice receiving SUB+aCD40 had a significantly improved median survival over those receiving monotherapy or vehicle (24.5d vs. SUB:15.5d, aCD40:20d, veh: 19d). scRNASeq revealed increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell and myeloid populations when comparing veh and monotherapy to SUB+aCD40. F4/80 IHC confirmed increased macrophage infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (p = 0.01). The survival advantage conferred by SUB+aCD40 was preserved in both CD8+ T-cell depleted mice (p=0.025) and nude mice (p=0.037), while clodronate eliminated the treatment survival advantage (p=0.39). FC showed increased tumor macrophage/monocyte infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (veh:11.9%, SUB+aCD40:22.5%, p=0.03) and reduction in SUB+aCD40+clod (12.6%, p=0.01). CD8+ T-cell CD69 expression decreased in the SUB+aCD40+clod group (SUB+aCD40:19%, SUB+aCD40+clod:6%, p< 0.01). CD8 T-cell infiltration (SUB+aCD40:4.95%, SUB+aCD40+clod:3.85%, p=0.27) and CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (veh: 1.26, SUB+aCD40:0.52, SUB+aCD40+clod:0.69, p=0.09) were not affected by clodronate. Conclusion: SUB+aCD40 therapy confers a survival advantage in the KPC46 model of PDAC in a T-cell independent manner by increasing macrophage/monocyte infiltration. SUB+aCD40 promotes CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation, but they do not contribute to survival advantage, possibly due to exhaustion. Future work will include addition of therapeutics to mitigate/reverse T-cell exhaustion to harness both innate and adaptive immunity in treating PDAC.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

The absence of Bank1 led to a significant reduction in ABC levels, also affecting other B cell populations. To gain deeper insights into their differentiation pathway and the impact of Bank1 on B cell populations, a single-cell transcriptome assay was performed. In the TLR7.tg6 model, we identified 10 clusters within B cells, including an ABC-specific cluster which was decreased in Bank1-deficient mice. In its absence, ABCs exhibited an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile, while being pro-inflammatory in Bank1-sufficient lupus mice. Trajectory analyses revealed that ABCs originated from marginal zone and memory-like B cells, ultimately acquiring transcriptional characteristics associated with atypical memory cells and long-lived plasma cells. Also, Bank1 deficiency normalized the presence of naïve B cells, which were nearly absent in lupus mice. Interestingly, Bank1 deficiency significantly reduced a distinct cluster containing IFN-responsive genes. These findings underscore the critical role of Bank1 in ABC development, impacting early B cell stages towards ABC differentiation, and the presence of IFN-stimulated gene-containing B cells, both populations determinant for autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="One of major breakthroughs in immunotherapy against tumor is from blocking immune checkpoint molecules on tumor and reactive T cells. The development of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockage antibodies has triggered to search for additional effective therapeutic strategies. This causes recent findings that blocking the interaction of checkpoint molecule NKG2A in NK and CD8 T cells with HLA-E in tumors is effective in defensing tumors. Interestingly, gut microbiota also affects this immune checkpoint immunotherapy against tumor. Gut microbiota such as bacteria can contribute to the regulation of host immune response and homeostasis. They not only promote the differentiation and function of immunosuppressive cells but also the inflammatory cells through the metabolites such as tryptophan (Trp) and bile acid (BA) metabolites as well as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These gut microbiota metabolites (GMMs) educated immune cells can affect the differentiation and function of effective CD8 and NK cells. Notably, these metabolites also directly affect the activity of CD8 and NK cells. Furthermore, the expression of CD94/NKG2A in the immune cells and/or their ligand HLA-E in the tumor cells is also regulated by gut microbiota associated immune factors. These findings offer new insights for the clinical application of gut microbiota in precise and/or personalized treatments of tumors. In this review, we will discuss the impacts of GMMs and GMM educated immune cells on the activity of effective CD8 and NK cells and the expression of CD94/NKG2A in immune cells and/or their ligand HLA-E in tumor cells.">

Among these effector molecules, the Salmonella outer protein B (SopB) was shown to possess phosphatidyl-inositol phosphatase activity and induce bacterial internalisation, promote cell survival, influence endosomal trafficking and alter host cell signalling. Using a neonatal S. Typhimurium infection model, we here show that SopB in vivo suppresses early epithelial chemokine expression, delays mucosal immune cell recruitment, reduces barrier impairment by enterocyte necroptosis, and prevents disease progression and premature death. Unexpectedly, this immunosuppressive effect was independent of the phosphatidyl-inositol phosphatase and phosphotransferase activity of SopB but required an intact N-terminal domain. Thus, SopB exerts a potent phosphatase-independent immunosuppressive effect to delay local tissue inflammation and disease progression likely to promote host transmission.">

By influencing the expression of immune checkpoint-associated proteins, the UPS modulates T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and can potentially facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. Additionally, the UPS contributes to the remodeling of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) by regulating B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and Treg cells. Targeting the UPS in conjunction with immune checkpoint-associated proteins, and combining these with other therapeutic approaches, may significantly enhance the efficacy of combination therapies and pave the way for novel cancer treatment strategies. In this review, we first summarize the composition and alterations of the TIME, with a particular emphasis on the role of the UPS in TIME and its interactions with various immune cell types. Finally, we explore the potential of combining UPS-targeted therapies with immunotherapy to substantially improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy and enhance patient survival outcomes.">

        <tr id="Despite significant progress in the treatment of some types of cancer, high-grade gliomas (HGGs) remain a significant clinical problem. In the case of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common solid tumor of the central nervous system in adults, the average survival time from diagnosis is only 15–18 months, despite the use of intensive multimodal therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells, which have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies, are a new, promising therapeutic option. However, the efficacy of CAR-T cells in solid tumors is lower due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype therefore seems particularly important because it may allow for increasing the effectiveness of CAR-T cells in the therapy of solid tumors. The following literature review aims to present the results of preclinical studies showing the possibilities of improving the efficacy of CAR-T in the TME of GBM by reprogramming the TME toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. It may be achievable thanks to the use of CAR-T in a synergistic therapy in combination with oncolytic viruses, radiotherapy, or epigenetic inhibitors, as well as by supporting CAR-T cells crossing of the blood–brain barrier, normalizing impaired angiogenesis in the TME, improving CAR-T effector functions by cytokine signaling or by blocking/knocking out T-cell inhibitors, and modulating the microRNA expression. The use of CAR-T cells modified in this way in synergistic therapy could lead to the longer survival of patients with HGG by inducing an endogenous anti-tumor response.">

        <tr id="Our understanding of T-cell-dependent humoral responses has been largely shaped by studies involving model antigens such as recombinant proteins and viruses 1,2. In these contexts, B cells internalize the entire antigen or pathogen, and present a range of antigens to helper CD4+ T cells to initiate the humoral response. However, this model does not account for large pathogens (such as parasites) that are too large to be taken up by individual B cells, and the mechanisms by which B cells acquire and present antigens from large complex pathogens to T cells remain poorly understood. Here we used Plasmodium, the causative parasite of malaria, as a model to investigate the requirements for T cell help for B cells targeting the Plasmodium surface circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Upon Plasmodium sporozoite (SPZ) immunization, CSP-specific B cells can form a synapse-like structure with SPZs and take up CSP and non-CSP surface antigens. As a result, CSP-specific B cells can receive help from CD4+ T cells specific to antigens that are located on the surface but not cytosol of the Plasmodium SPZ. Therefore, B cells can obtain help, not only from T cells with the same protein specificity, but also from T cells specific for spatially linked antigens. This flexibility in T cell help may enhance the initiation and maintenance of humoral immune responses to complex pathogens.">

Exhausted-like CD8+ T cells (CD8+ Tex) displayed decreased effector and proliferative capabilities, elevated co-inhibitory receptor generation, decreased cytotoxicity, and changes in metabolism and transcription. TME induces T cell exhaustion through long-term antigen stimulation, upregulation of immune checkpoints, recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. CD8+ Tex may be both the reflection of cancer progression and the reason for poor cancer control. The successful outcome of the current cancer immunotherapies, which include immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell treatment, depends on CD8+ Tex. In this review, we are interested in the intercellular signaling network of immune cells interacting with CD8+ Tex.

        <tr id="Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) greatly contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance of cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms and whether TAMs can be promising targets to overcome ICI resistance remain to be unveiled. Through integrative analysis of immune multiomics data and single‐cell RNA‐seq data (iMOS) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lymphotoxin β receptor (LTBR) is identified as a potential immune checkpoint of TAMs, whose high expression, duplication, and low methylation are correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

        <tr id="The murine intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri powerfully modulates the host immune response. This is achieved in part through the HpARI family (HpARI1/2/3), which act on IL-33, and the HpBARI family (HpBARI and HpBARI_Hom2), which act on ST2. Here, we find that this immunomodulation is evident only in the first week of infection, with abrogation of ST2 detection and systemic suppression of IL-33-dependent responses. Vaccination with individual HpARI or HpBARI family members raised antibody responses which could block these proteins’ immunomodulatory activities. During infection, vaccination could release the host from immunosuppression: HpARI2 vaccination resulted in much increased ILC2 and Th2 immunity, with heightened serum IL-4 and IL-5 responses, but did not abrogate ST2 suppression. In contrast, a HpBARI+HpBARI_Hom2 vaccination cocktail resulted in abrogation of ST2 suppression, and again increased Th2 immunity and serum cytokine responses. Either of the HpARI2 or the HpBARI cocktail vaccinations provided significant protection against subsequent H. polygyrus bakeri infection. We therefore show a proof of principle that vaccination with immunomodulatory proteins can protect the host against infection, and can be used as a tool for blocking the effects of specific parasite-derived proteins.">

While multiple infiltrated immune cells have been reported to mediate disease progress, knowledge of HPV-reactive T-cell subsets in papillomas remains elusive. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and RNA microarray, we found that CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells with strong interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production expanded, and were negatively correlated to the disease severity in the frequency of surgery. These IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells were readily activated and expanded in vitro by autologous dendritic cells loaded with HPV11 E7 peptide pool. Moreover, T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion was observed in JORRP papilloma tissues, indicating a biased TCR repertoire toward HPV-specific recognition. Finally, we identified and characterized HPV11 E7-specific candidate TCR clonotypes from IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells, suggesting their potential application in TCR-engineered T cells (TCR-T) therapy for HPV11-related diseases. Our findings provided insights into the specific local immune response to HPV6/11 infection and highlighted the importance of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TRM cells in anti-HPV6/11 T-cell immunity.IMPORTANCEThe persistent recurrence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11 infection in papillomas underscores the failure of local immune responses in patients with juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP).

Understanding the T-cell-mediated immune responses within JORRP papilloma tissues is crucial for disease control. In the present study, we characterized CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells as the primary T-cell subset responsible for local anti-HPV6/11 immunity. Moreover, we identified two HPV11 E7-specific candidate T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes out of IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells. Overall, our findings provided insights into the local immune responses to HPV6/11 infection and offered information for developing more effective immunotherapeutic strategies against JORRP.">

        <tr id="The activation of innate immunity and associated interferon (IFN) signaling have been implicated in cancer, but the regulators are elusive and a link to tumor suppression undetermined. Here, we found that Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase altered in Parkinson's Disease was epigenetically silenced in cancer and its re-expression by clinically approved demethylating therapy stimulated transcription of a potent IFN response in tumor cells. This pathway required Parkin E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, involved the subcellular trafficking and release of the alarmin High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and was associated with inhibition of NFκB gene expression. In turn, Parkin-expressing cells released an IFN secretome that upregulated effector and cytotoxic CD8 T cell markers, lowered the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, TIM3 and LAG3, and stimulated high content of the self-renewal/stem cell factor, TCF1. Parkin-induced CD8 T cells selectively accumulated in the microenvironment and inhibited transgenic and syngeneic tumor growth, in vivo. Therefore, Parkin is an epigenetically regulated activator of innate immunity and dual mode tumor suppressor, inhibiting intrinsic tumor traits of metabolism and cell invasion, while simultaneously reinvigorating CD8 T cell functions in the microenvironment.">

        <tr id="The use of antitumor drugs represents a reliable strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become increasingly common and contributes to tumor metastasis and local recurrence. The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) consists of immune cells, cytokines and immunomodulators, and collectively they influence the response to treatment. Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as increased drug exportation have been reported to contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancers. In the past few years, the majority of studies on tumors have only focused on the development and progression of a tumor from a mechanistic standpoint; few studies have examined whether the changes in the TME can also affect tumor growth and drug resistance. Recently, emerging evidence have raised more concerns regarding the role of TME in the development of drug resistance. In the present review, it was discussed how the suppressive TME adapts to drug resistance characterized by the cooperation of immune cells, cytokines, immunomodulators, stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was reviewed how these immunological or metabolic changes alter immuno-surveillance and thus facilitate tumor drug resistance. In addition, potential targets present in the TME for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve individualized therapy for cancer treatment were revealed.">

        <tr id="Since their conception with the smallpox vaccine, vaccines used worldwide have mitigated multiple pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Insightful studies have uncovered the complexities of different functional networks of CD4 T cells (T helper 1 (Th1); Th2, Th17) and CD8 T cells (T cytotoxic; Tc), as well as B cell (BIgM, BIgG, BIgA and BIgE) subsets, during the response to vaccination. Both T and B cell subsets form central, peripheral, and tissue-resident subsets during vaccination. It has also become apparent that each vaccination forms a network of T regulatory subsets, namely CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells and interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD4+ Foxp3− T regulatory 1 (Tr1), as well as many others, which shape the quality/quantity of vaccine-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody production. These components are especially critical for immunocompromised patients, such as older individuals and allograft recipients, as their vaccination may be ineffective or less effective. This review focuses on considering how the pre- and post-vaccination Treg/Tr1 levels influence the vaccination efficacy. Experimental and clinical work has revealed that Treg/Tr1 involvement evokes different immune mechanisms in diminishing vaccine-induced cellular/humoral responses. Alternative steps may be considered to improve the vaccination response, such as increasing the dose, changing the delivery route, and/or repeated booster doses of vaccines. Vaccination may be combined with anti-CD25 (IL-2Rα chain) or anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to decrease the Tregs and boost the T/B cell immune response. All of these data and strategies for immunizations are presented and discussed, aiming to improve the efficacy of vaccination in humans and especially in immunocompromised and older individuals, as well as organ transplant patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. Although serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) family members play crucial roles in tumors, their impact on tumor immunology remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of SRSF10 in HCC immunotherapy.


METHODS
To identify the key genes associated with immunotherapy resistance, we conducted single-nuclear RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, and The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses. We investigated the biological functions of SRSF10 in immune evasion using in vitro co-culture systems, flow cytometry, various tumor-bearing mouse models, and patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids.


RESULTS
SRSF10 was upregulated in various tumors and associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, SRSF10 positively regulated lactate production, and SRSF10/glycolysis/ histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) formed a positive feedback loop in tumor cells. Increased lactate levels promoted M2 macrophage polarization, thereby inhibiting CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, SRSF10 interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of MYB, enhancing MYB RNA stability, and subsequently upregulating key glycolysis-related enzymes including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), resulting in elevated intracellular and extracellular lactate levels. Lactate accumulation induced histone lactylation, which further upregulated SRSF10 expression. Additionally, lactate produced by tumors induced lactylation of the histone H3K18la site upon transport into macrophages, thereby activating transcription and enhancing pro-tumor macrophage activity. M2 macrophages, in turn, inhibited the enrichment of CD8+ T cells and the proportion of interferon-γ+CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus creating an immunosuppressive TME. Clinically, SRSF10 could serve as a biomarker for assessing immunotherapy resistance in various solid tumors. Pharmacological targeting of SRSF10 with a selective inhibitor 1C8 enhanced the efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in both murine and human preclinical models.


CONCLUSIONS
The SRSF10/MYB/glycolysis/lactate axis is critical for triggering immune evasion and anti-PD-1 resistance. Inhibiting SRSF10 by 1C8 may overcome anti-PD-1 tolerance in HCC.">

        <tr id="A key mediator of T cell impairment during respiratory virus infection is the inhibitory receptor PD-1. PD-1 is induced on T cells following antigen exposure, whereas proinflammatory cytokines upregulate the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Respiratory virus infection leads to upregulation of PD-L1 on airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and alveolar macrophages. However, the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in acute respiratory virus infections is not known. We sought to determine the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in CD8+ T cell impairment. We found that PD-L1-/- mice challenged with human metapneumovirus or influenza showed a similar level of CD8+ T cell impairment compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, virus clearance was delayed in PD-L1-/- mice compared to WT. CD8+ T cells from PD-L1-deficient mice expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors both at baseline and after respiratory virus infection. The antibody blockade of PD-L2 failed to restore function to the impaired cells. While reciprocal bone marrow chimeras between WT and PD-L1-/- mice did not restore CD8+ T cell function after the respiratory virus challenge, mice that received the PD-L1-/- bone marrow had higher inhibitory receptor expression on CD8+ cells. This discrepancy in the inhibitory receptor expression suggests that cells of the hematopoietic compartment contribute to T cell impairment on CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEThe phenomenon of pulmonary CD8+ T cell impairment with diminished antiviral function occurs during acute respiratory virus infection mediated by Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) signaling. Moreover, PD-1 blockade enhances T cell function to hasten viral clearance. The ligand PD-L1 is expressed in many cell types, but which cells drive lung T cell impairment is not known. We used genetic approaches to determine the contribution of PD-L1 on lung T cell impairment. We found that PD-L2 cannot compensate for the loss of PD-L1, and PD-L1-deficient mice exhibit increased expression of other inhibitory receptors. Bone marrow chimeras between PD-L1-deficient and wild-type mice indicated that hematopoietic PD-L1 expression is associated with inhibitory receptor upregulation and impairment.">

        <tr id="In both humans and mice, natural killer (NK) cells are important lymphocytes of the innate immune system. They are often considered pro-inflammatory effector cells but may also have a regulatory or pro-resolving function by switching their cytokine profile towards the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β, and by killing pro-inflammatory immune cells. Here, the role of NK cells in the resolution of malaria lung pathology was studied. Malaria complications, such as malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS), are often lethal despite the rapid and efficient killing of Plasmodium parasites with antimalarial drugs. Hence, studying the resolution and healing mechanisms involved in the recovery from these complications could be useful to develop adjunctive treatments. Treatment of Plasmodium berghei NK65-infected C57BL/6 mice with a combination of artesunate and chloroquine starting at the appearance of symptoms was used as a model to study the resolution of MA-ARDS. The role of NK cells was studied using anti-NK1.1 depletion antibodies and NK cell-deficient mice. Using both methods, NK cells were found to be dispensable in the development of MA-ARDS, as shown previously. In contrast, NK cells were crucial in the initiation of resolution upon antimalarial treatment, as survival was significantly decreased in the absence of NK cells. Considerably increased IL-10 expression by NK cells suggested an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving phenotype. Despite the increase in Il10 expression in the NK cells, inhibition of the IL-10/IL-10R axis using anti-IL10R antibodies had no effect on the resolution for MA-ARDS, suggesting that the pro-resolving effect of NK cells cannot solely be attributed to their IL-10 production. In conclusion, NK cells contribute to the resolution of experimental MA-ARDS.">

 Immunotherapy has had very limited success in pancreatic cancer, due to its low mutational burden and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our approach consists in redirecting pre- existing antiviral immunity against pancreatic tumors by delivering viral antigens using the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD .This peptide, targets the tumor vasculature through av integrins and neuropilin-1, delivering conjugated or co-administered cargo to tumors. Here we used mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) as an infection model. CMV is a β-herpesvirus that induces a strong T-cell response in mice and humans, comprising >10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells mostly with effector-memory phenotype. Importantly, human CMV infects over 60% of the world’s population rendering it a suitable candidate for translation. Methods: Mice latently infected with CMV were orthotopically implanted with KPC pancreatic tumor cells and treated with systemic injections of vehicle or iRGD plus CMV class I and II binding peptides. Another cohort of age matched uninfected mice was used as a control. Tumor growth and mouse weight were monitored twice a week and CMV specific immune responses were measured in spleen, liver and tumor by flow cytometry, using tetramer staining and CMV specific peptide recall. Results: CMV infected mice receiving iRGD+CMV peptides responded to treatment as evidenced by delayed tumor growth associated with increased tumor necrosis and T cell infiltration. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of tumor, liver and spleen showed a significant increase in CMV specific T cells preferentially in the tumor. Surprisingly, these T cells preferentially infiltrated tumors regardless of the use of iRGD for tumor targeting of CMV peptides. Survival studies showed a marked increase in median survival, reaching 42 days in the infected and treated group, compared to 25 days in the vehicle treated one. The survival benefit was very similar in the presence or absence of iRGD. Combining this strategy with anti- PD1 and or anti-IL10R did not significantly improve the benefits of CMV therapy alone. On the other hand, combination with low dose gemcitabine (5mg/kg) significantly improved tumor growth delay and survival in the combination compared to either therapy alone. The median survival reached 49 days in the combination, compared to 39 for gemcitabine or CMV therapy alone and 32 for vehicle.Conclusions: We have recently performed single cell RNA sequencing in tumors from infected and CMV peptide or vehicle treated mice and will analyze the transcriptional profile and TCR sequence of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary analysis of this data shows a massive T cell infiltration and an increase in dendritic cells and macrophages in infected and treated mice. Taken together, this data shows we can deliver antigens to pancreatic tumors and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that results in delayed tumor growth and has a survival benefit. This is a mutation agnostic approach with high translational value, since more than 60% of the population has previous CMV immunity.

        <tr id="Background Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients. Conclusion The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and preventing harmful autoimmune reactions is a fundamental task of the immune system. However, these essential functions are significantly compromised during autoimmune disorders, creating a major challenge in treating these conditions. In this context, we provide an overview of research on small spleen polypeptides (SSPs) that naturally regulate peripheral immune tolerance. Alongside outlining the observed effects of SSPs, we summarize here the findings on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie their regulatory impact. Specifically, SSPs have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in halting the progression of developing or established autoimmune disorders like psoriasis or arthritis in animal models. They primarily target dendritic cells (DCs), swiftly prompting the production of extracellular ATP, which is then degraded and sensed by adenosine receptors. This process triggers the mTOR signaling cascade, similar to powerful immune triggers, but instead of a rapid and intense reaction, it leads to a moderate yet significant activation of the mTOR signaling cascade. This induces a tolerogenic state in dendritic cells, ultimately leading to the generation of Foxp3+ immunosuppressor Treg cells. In addition, SSPs may indirectly attenuate the autoimmune response by reducing extracellular ATP synthesis in non-immune cells, such as endothelial cells, when exposed to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. SSPs thus have the potential to contribute to the restoration of peripheral immune tolerance and may offer valuable therapeutic benefits in treating autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Despite progress significant advances in immunotherapy for some solid tumors, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unresponsive poorly responsive to such interventions, largely due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) with limited CD8+ T cell infiltration. This study explores the role of the epigenetic factor Sin3B in the PDAC TME. Using murine PDAC models, we found that tumor cell-intrinsic Sin3B loss reshapes the TME, increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity, thus impeding tumor progression and enhancing sensitivity to anti-PD1 treatment. Sin3B-deficient tumor cells exhibited amplified CXCL9/10 secretion in response to Interferon-gamma (IFNγ), creating a positive feedback loop via the CXCL9/10-CXCR3 axis, thereby intensifying the anti-tumor immune response against PDAC. Mechanistically, extensive epigenetic regulation is uncovered by Sin3B loss, particularly enhanced H3K27Ac distribution on genes related to immune responses in PDAC cells. Consistent with the murine model findings, analysis of human PDAC samples revealed a significant inverse correlation between SIN3B levels and both CD8+ T cell infiltration and CXCL9/10 expression. Notebly, PDAC patients with lower SIN3B expression showed a more favorable response to anti-PD1 therapy. The findings suggest that targeting SIN3B can enhance cytotoxic T cell infiltration into the tumor site and improve immunotherapy efficacy in PDAC, offering potential avenues for therapeutic biomarker or target in this challenging disease.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to tumor immune escape and immunotherapy tolerance. The effects of hormones such as leptin, steroid hormones, and glucocorticoids on T cell function have been reported previously. However, the mechanism underlying thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)/thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) signaling in CD8+ T cell exhaustion and tumor immune evasion remain poorly understood. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of TSH/TSHR signaling on the function of CD8+ T cells and immune evasion in colorectal cancer (CRC).


METHODS
TSHR expression levels in CD8+ T cells were assessed with immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Functional investigations involved manipulation of TSHR expression in cellular and mouse models to study its role in CD8+ T cells. Mechanistic insights were mainly gained through RNA-sequencing, Western blotting, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase activity assay. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to investigate the source of TSH and TSHR in CRC tissues.


RESULTS
TSHR was highly expressed in cancer cells and CD8+ T cells in CRC tissues. TSH/TSHR signaling was identified as the intrinsic pathway promoting CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Conditional deletion of TSHR in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) improved effector differentiation and suppressed the expression of immune checkpoint receptors such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVCR2 or TIM3) through the protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. CRC cells secreted TSHR via exosomes to increase the TSHR level in CD8+ T cells, resulting in immunosuppression in the TME. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) was the main source of TSH within the TME. Low expression of TSHR in CRC was a predictor of immunotherapy response.


CONCLUSIONS
The present findings highlighted the role of endogenous TSH/TSHR signaling in CD8+ T cell exhaustion and immune evasion in CRC. TSHR may be suitable as a predictive and therapeutic biomarker in CRC immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Exosomal programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), an exosomal membrane protein found in many tumor types, is reckoned to help regulate the immune microenvironment. However, the functions and the mechanisms underlying the exosome-mediated regulation of the immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown. Methods: Western blotting was used to investigate the levels of exosomal PD-L1 in the peripheral blood of patients with CRC and healthy controls. A CRC mouse model was constructed by administering 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) and dextrane sodium sulfate (DSS) intraperitoneally. The mice were then administered the control or CRC-derived exosomes to examine the regulatory effect of the exosomes on macrophage infiltration and CRC development. In vitro studies, using a coculture system, and flow cytometry analysis were conducted to examine the relationship between the regulatory effect of CRC-derived exosomes on CD4+ T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. RNA-seq and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulatory effect of the CRC-derived exosomes on macrophage proliferation and the regulation of the immune microenvironment during CRC development. Results: In patients with CRC, higher levels of exosomal PD-L1 were associated with a more severe form of disease. The treatment of mice with AOM/DSS-induced CRC with CRC-derived exosomes resulted in high levels of macrophage proliferation, increased PD-L1 levels in macrophages, and accelerated CRC progression. Importantly, analysis of an in vitro coculture system and flow cytometry analysis showed that the CRC-derived exosomes transported PD-L1 into macrophages and impaired CD4+ T cell function. Preliminary data suggest that the NF-κb signaling pathway regulates the function of CRC-derived exosomal PD-L1-dependent macrophages. Conclusion: CRC-derived exosomes induce the proliferation of macrophages and increase their PD-L1 levels. They also impair CD4+ T cell function and promote CRC progression. Our findings reveal a novel exosomal PD-L1-mediated crosstalk between the CRC cells and immune cells in the CRC microenvironment.">

Here, using a 3D co-culture system based on human intestinal epithelial organoids, we explore the capacity of IFNγ-exposure to reprogram intestinal epithelia and thereby directly modulate lymphocyte responses. IFNγ treatment of organoids led to transcriptional reprogramming, marked by a switch to a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, including transcriptional upregulation of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Proteomic analysis of organoid-conditioned medium post-treatment confirmed chemokine secretion. IFNγ-treatment of organoids led to enhanced T cell migration in a CXCL11-dependent manner without affecting T cell activation status. Taken together, our results suggest a specific role for CXCL11 in T cell recruitment that could be targeted to prevent T cell trafficking to the inflamed intestine.">

Their cytotoxic power requires that activation is tightly controlled, and in this, they take a unique position within the immune system. Rather than depending on the engagement of a single activating receptor, their activation involves a delicate balance between inhibitory and activating signals mediated through an array of surface molecules. Only when this cumulative balance surpasses a specific threshold do NK cells initiate their activity. Remarkably, the activation threshold of NK cells remains robust even when cells express vastly different repertoires of inhibitory and activating receptors. These threshold values seem to be influenced by NK cell interactions with their environment during development and after release from the bone marrow. Understanding how NK cells integrate this intricate pattern of stimuli is an ongoing area of research, particularly relevant for cellular therapies seeking to harness the anti-cancer potential of these cells by modifying surface receptor expression. In this review, we will explore some of the current dogmas regarding NK cell activation and discuss recent literature addressing advances in our understanding of this field.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, with oncolytic adenoviruses showing power as immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic potential of an adenovirus construct expressing CXCL9, CXCL10, or IL-15 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor models. Our results demonstrated robust cytokine secretion upon viral treatment, suggesting effective transgene expression. Subsequent analysis using resistance-based transwell migration and microfluidic chip assays demonstrated increased T-cell migration in response to chemokine secretion by infected cells in both 2D and 3D cell models. Flow cytometry analysis revealed CXCR3 receptor expression across T-cell subsets, with the highest percentage found on CD8+ T-cells, underscoring their key role in immune cell migration. Alongside T-cells, we also detected NK-cells in the tumors of immunocompromised mice treated with cytokine-encoding adenoviruses. Furthermore, we identified potential immunogenic antigens that may enhance the efficacy and specificity of our armed oncolytic adenoviruses in ccRCC. Overall, our findings using ccRCC cell line, in vivo humanized mice, physiologically relevant PDCs in 2D and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in 3D suggest that chemokine-armed adenoviruses hold promise for enhancing T-cell migration and improving immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC. Our study contributes to the development of more effective ccRCC treatment strategies by elucidating immune cell infiltration and activation mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and highlights the usefulness of PDOs for predicting clinical relevance and validating novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Overall, our research offers insights into the rational design and optimization of viral-based immunotherapies for ccRCC.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has quickly risen to become the 3rd leading cause of cancer- related death. This is in part due to its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here we investigated an innovative immunotherapy approach combining delivery of STING and TLR4 innate immune agonists via lipid-based nanoparticles (NPs) co-encapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies that can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other pro-inflammatory signaling, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell-driven and Type I interferon-mediated tumor regressions and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models dependent on both tumor and host STING activation. STING and TLR4-mediated Type I interferon signaling were also associated with enhanced NK and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can synergize to orchestrate a coordinated Type I interferon-driven innate and adaptive immune assault to overcome immune suppression and activate durable anti-tumor T cell responses against PDAC.

Very-early-differentiated stem cell memory T cells (TSCMs) have superior self-renewal, engraftment, persistence, and anticancer efficacy, but their potential for antiviral ACT remains unknown. Here, we developed a clinically scalable protocol for expanding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific TSCM-enriched T cells with high proportions of CD4+ T cells and broad EBV antigen coverage. These cells showed tumor control in a xenograft model of EBV-induced lymphoma and were superior to previous ACT protocols in terms of tumor infiltration, in vivo proliferation, persistence, proportion of functional CD4+ T cells, and diversity of EBV antigen specificity. Thus, our protocol may pave the way for the next generation of potent unmodified antigen-specific cell therapies for EBV-associated diseases, including tumors, and other indications.">

Noteworthy, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) have been recently acknowledged as an important class of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the context of host–microorganism interactions shaping the adaptive immune response in the intestinal mucosa. Although a broad range of mouse models has led to significant progress in untangling the role of ILC3s as APCs, the outcome of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent ILC-T cell crosstalk in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains underexplored in human. Moreover, expression of MHCII is confined to ILC3 subset, endowed with lymphoid tissue-inducing properties, that adopts tissue-specific fates and functions. Intestinal microbiota could dictate the plasticity of antigen-presenting ILC3s and we here summarize our current understanding of the functions of these cells in both mouse and human CRC discussing the role of microbiota as a key modulator of their tumor-suppressive activity.">

Neutrophils, despite being the most populous immune cells in human blood circulation, are not considered a viable option for cellular therapies because of their short lifespan and poor understanding of their role in the pathophysiology of various diseases. In inflammatory conditions, neutrophils exhibit an activated phenotype. Activation brings about significant changes to neutrophil biology such as increased lifespan, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and enhanced effector functions. Activated neutrophils also possess the potential to stimulate the downstream immune response and are described as essential effectors in the immune response to tumors. This makes activated neutrophils an interesting candidate for cell therapies. Here, we review the biology of activated neutrophils in detail. We discuss the different ways neutrophils can be activated and the effect they have on other immune cells for stimulation of downstream immune response. We review the conditions where activated neutrophil therapy can be therapeutically beneficial and discuss the challenges associated with their eventual translation.

 Introduction: The prostate cancer (PCa) microenvironment plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses, potentially impacting disease progression and treatment outcomes. SPDEF, a transcription factor, has been implicated in PCa progression, yet its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment remains incompletely understood. Methods: To comprehensively evaluate the impact of SPDEF-mediated changes in the PCa microenvironment on immune cells, we employed multiple experimental approaches. Firstly, utilizing the ProcartaPlex Human Cytokine & Chemokine Panel 1 16plex assay, we analyzed cytokine and chemokine alterations in cell culture supernatants from various PCa cell line models—PC3-VC, PC3-SPDEF, RC77/T-VC, RC77/T-SPDEF, LNCaP-VC, and LNCaP-shSPDEF. Subsequently, human primary T cells were exposed to PCa cell-derived conditioned media to assess their proliferation and activation status, using IncuCyte cell imaging and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Our ProcartaPlex assay validated transcriptomic observations from RNA-seq experiment, confirming elevated cytokine/chemokine levels in SPDEF-overexpressing models and decreased levels in SPDEF-suppressed conditions. Notably, T cell proliferation assays demonstrated increased proliferation in response to SPDEF-overexpressing PCa conditional media and diminished proliferation in SPDEF-suppressed conditions. Moreover, SPDEF downregulation led to decreased proliferation in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Assessing CD8+ T cell activation markers revealed varying impacts on IFN-γ expression, showing reduced levels in LNCaP-shSPDEF but inconclusive effects in PC3-SPDEF overexpression models. Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay between SPDEF alterations in the PCa microenvironment and immune cell behavior, particularly T cell proliferation and activation. The observed effects underscore the complexity of SPDEF-mediated alterations on immune responses within the tumor milieu. Further investigations into the divergent effects of SPDEF on T cell dynamics are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms governing these interactions, potentially offering insights into novel therapeutic targets for PCa.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Donor cell engraftment is a pre-requisite of successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Based on peripheral blood analyses it is characterized by early myeloid recovery and T- and B-cells lymphopenia. However, cellular networks associated with bone marrow engraftment of allogeneic human cells have been poorly described.


METHODS
Mass cytometry and CITEseq analyses were performed on bone marrow cells, three months post-transplant in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.


RESULTS
Mass cytometry in 26 patients and 20 healthy controls disclosed profound alterations in myeloid and B-cell progenitors, with a shift towards terminal myeloid differentiation and decreased B-cell progenitors. Unsupervised analysis separated recipients into 2 groups, one of them being driven by previous GVHD (R2 patients). We then used single-cell CITEseq to decipher engraftment, which resolved 36 clusters, encompassing all bone marrow cellular components. Hematopoiesis in transplant recipients was sustained by committed myeloid and erythroid progenitors in a setting of monocytes-, NK cells- and T-cells mediated inflammation. Gene expression disclosed major pathways in transplant recipients, namely, TNFα signaling via NFκ-B, and interferon-γ response. The hallmark of allograft rejection was consistently found in clusters from transplant recipients, especially in R2 recipients.


CONCLUSION
Bone marrow cell engraftment of allogeneic donor cells is characterized by a state of emergency hematopoiesis in the setting of allogeneic response driving inflammation.

BP1003 is a neutral liposome incorporated with a nuclease-resistant P-ethoxy antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) targeting the STAT3 mRNA. Its unique design enhances BP1003 stability, cellular uptake, and target affinity. BP1003 efficiently reduces STAT3 expression and enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer cells (HER2+, triple negative) and ovarian cancer cells (late stage, invasive ovarian cancer) to paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in both 2D and 3D cell cultures. Similarly, ex vivo and in vivo patient-derived models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) show reduced tissue viability and tumor volume with BP1003 and gemcitabine combination treatments. In addition to directly affecting tumor cells, BP1003 can modulate the tumor microenvironment. Unlike M1 differentiation, monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages is suppressed by BP1003, indicating its potential contribution to immunotherapy. The broad anti-tumor effect of BP1003 in numerous preclinical solid tumor models, such as breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer models shown in this work, makes it a promising cancer therapeutic.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important players in the tumor microenvironment. However, the mechanisms behind their immunosuppressive effects are poorly understood. We found that CCR6-CCL20 activity in tumor-infiltrating Tregs is associated with greater glycolytic activity and ablation of Ccr6 reduced glycolysis and lactic acid production while increasing compensatory glutamine metabolism. Immunosuppressive activity towards CD8+ T cells was abrogated in Ccr6-/- Tregs due to reduction in activation-induced glycolysis. Furthermore, Ccr6-/- mice exhibited improved survival across multiple tumor models compared to wildtype mice, and Treg and CD8+ T-cell depletion abrogated the improvement. In addition, Ccr6 ablation further promoted the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in a preclinical glioma model. Follow-up knockdown of Ccl20 with siRNA also demonstrated improvement in antitumor efficacy. Our results unveil CCR6 as a marker and regulator of Treg-induced immunosuppression and identify approaches to target the metabolic determinants of Treg immunosuppressive activity.">

        <tr id="Pro-inflammatory immune responses are rapidly suppressed during blood-stage malaria but the molecular mechanisms driving this regulation are still incompletely understood. In this study, we show that the co-inhibitory receptors TIGIT and PD-1 are upregulated and co-expressed by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells (ovalbumin-specific OT-II cells) during non-lethal Plasmodium yoelii expressing ovalbumin (PyNL-OVA) blood-stage infection. Synergistic blockade of TIGIT and PD-L1, but not individual blockade of each receptor, during the early stages of infection significantly improved parasite control during the peak stages (days 10-15) of infection. Mechanistically, this protection was correlated with significantly increased plasma levels of IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2, and an increase in the frequencies of IFN-γ-producing antigen-specific T-bet+ CD4+ T cells (OT-II cells), but not antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (OT-I cells), along with expansion of the splenic red pulp and monocyte-derived macrophage populations. Collectively, our study identifies a novel role for TIGIT in combination with the PD1-PD-L1 axis in regulating specific components of the pro-inflammatory immune response and restricting parasite control during the acute stages of blood-stage PyNL infection.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies characterized by differentiation arrest, high relapse rates, and poor survival. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is recognized as a critical mediator of drug resistance and a primary site responsible for AML relapse. Our previous study reported that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAr) induces AML cell differentiation by inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis and activating Checkpoint kinase 1. While the protective effect of BM stroma on leukemia cells in response to cytotoxic drugs is well-documented, its effect on AML differentiation remains less explored. In this study, we investigated the impact of stromal cell lines and primary mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) on AML cell line differentiation triggered by AICAr and brequinar, a known dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor. Our findings indicate that the mouse MS-5 stromal cell line, known for its cytoprotective effects, does not inhibit AML cell differentiation induced by pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors. Interestingly, AICAr caused morphological changes and growth arrest in MS-5 stromal cells via an AMPK-dependent pathway. Human stromal cell lines HS-5 and HS-27, as well as primary MSCs isolated from patient bone marrow, were superior in promoting AML differentiation compared to mouse cells in response to AICAr and brequinar, with the inhibitors not significantly affecting the stromal cells themselves. In conclusion, our study highlights the supportive role of human BM MSCs in enhancing the differentiation effects of pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors on AML cells, suggesting that AML treatment strategies focusing on differentiation rather than cell killing may be successful in clinical settings.">

Because of this, mucosal barrier-colonizing bacteria can be leveraged to act as long-term delivery vehicles for naturally derived therapeutics. Here, we use a mouse model of corneal wound healing to show that the eye-colonizing bacterium, Corynebacterium mastitidis (C. mast) can be engineered to produce and secrete bioactive murine anti-inflammatory interleukin (mIL)-10. Specifically, we used transposon mutagenesis to identify a native C. mast-specific secretion signal that was used to direct C. mast to secrete mIL-10. Mini-transposons were generated to deliver secretion capable mIL-10 to the bacterial genome. After screening, two isolates were identified that can: 1) colonize the eye, 2) produce and secrete mIL-10, and 3) enhance wound healing in an IL-10-dependent manner. This proof of concept illustrates that eye-colonizing bacteria can be engineered to deliver therapeutics to the ocular surface for the alleviation of ocular surface disease(s).">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells, the “superstar” of the immune system, play a crucial role in antitumor immunity. T‐cell receptors (TCR) are crucial molecules that enable T cells to identify antigens and start immunological responses. The body has evolved a unique method for rearrangement, resulting in a vast diversity of TCR repertoires. A healthy TCR repertoire is essential for the particular identification of antigens by T cells. Methods In this article, we systematically summarized the TCR creation mechanisms and analysis methodologies, particularly focusing on the application of next‐generation sequencing (NGS) technology. We explore the TCR repertoire in health and cancer, and discuss the implications of TCR repertoire analysis in understanding carcinogenesis, cancer progression, and treatment. Results The TCR repertoire analysis has enormous potential for monitoring the emergence and progression of malignancies, as well as assessing therapy response and prognosis. The application of NGS has dramatically accelerated our comprehension of TCR diversity and its role in cancer immunity. Conclusions To substantiate the significance of TCR repertoires as biomarkers, more thorough and exhaustive research should be conducted. The TCR repertoire analysis, enabled by advanced sequencing technologies, is poised to become a crucial tool in the future of cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy evaluation.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely aggressive cancer, with a mere 13% average 5-year survival rate. The hallmark desmoplastic stromal response in PDAC leads to poor vascularization, drug delivery challenges, and impaired cytotoxic immune cell infiltration, contributing to de novo therapy resistance. Our previous research has shown therapeutic induction of cellular senescence with RAS pathway targeting therapies can induce cytokine and chemokine production through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that can effectively activate anti-tumor T cell immunity and responses to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. To build on these findings as well as overcome limitations associated with senescence-inducing therapy toxicity and induction of pro-tumorigenic SASP cytokines, here we leveraged mRNA technology to deliver specific SASP cytokines and chemokines we have found to stimulate immune responses directly into the suppressive PDAC TME as an immune oncology platform. We created an in vitro transcription pipeline for mRNA production and multiplexing, and demonstrate we can intratumorally deliver multiple mRNAs simultaneously into the TME of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models, stimulating the local production of cytokines normally absent in PDAC. We further characterized a novel combination of five cytokines and chemokines that can effectively recruit and activate both innate and adaptive immune responses against PDAC. Through repeated bi-weekly dosing, this mRNA combination also promotes tumor destruction and improves survival outcomes. Considering the recent success of off-the-shelf neoantigen mRNA vaccines in early human PDAC patient trials, we have now developed mRNAs that encode PDAC-specific antigens. By integrating our cytokine mRNA platform with antigen mRNAs, we observe a significant increase in intratumoral antigen-presenting dendritic cell populations and a substantially enhanced T-cell mediated anti- tumor immune response in orthotopic transplant models of PDAC. Overall, this study not only unveils pivotal insights into the cytokines absent in PDAC that are crucial for promoting anti- tumor immunity, but also pioneers an innovative immunotherapy approach. This platform has the potential to be integrated with existing immunotherapy modalities, addressing the longstanding challenge of therapy resistance in PDAC.

        <tr id="Strategies for tackling cancer involve surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICB). However, the effectiveness of ICB remains constrained, prompting the need for a proactive strategy to foresee treatment responses and resistances. This study undertook an analysis across diverse cancer patient cohorts (including melanoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, glioblastoma, bladder, and stomach cancers) subjected to various immune checkpoint blockade treatments. Surprisingly, our findings unveiled that over 38% of patients demonstrated resistance and persistent disease progression despite undergoing ICB intervention. To unravel the intricacies of resistance, we scrutinized the immune profiles of cancer patients experiencing ongoing disease progression and resistance post-ICB therapy. These profiles delineated multifaceted defects, including compromised macrophage, monocyte, and T cell responses, impaired antigen presentation, aberrant regulatory T cell (Tregs) responses, and an elevated expression of immunosuppressive and G protein-coupled receptor molecules (TGFB1, IL2RA, IL1B, EDNRB, ADORA2A, SELP, and CD276). Building upon these insights into resistance profiles, we harnessed machine learning algorithms to construct models predicting the response and resistance to ICB and developed the accompanying software. While previous work on glioblastoma with only one type of algorithm had an accuracy of 0.82, we managed to develop 20 models that provided estimates of future events of resistance or response in five cancer types, with accuracies ranging between 0.79 and 1, based on their distinct immune characteristics. In conclusion, our approach advocates for the personalized application of immunotherapy in cancer patients based on patient-specific attributes and computational models.">

 Neutrophils are integral to the metastatic tumor microenvironment (TME), and discrete subsets of neutrophils have been associated with pro- and anti-tumor responses. However, the composition of neutrophils in the metastatic TME and strategies to harness neutrophils for the treatment of metastatic disease remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the role of neutrophils in metastatic disease using mouse models of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By utilizing mouse PDAC cells driven by mutant KRAS and p53 with controllable expression of ovalbumin, an immunogenic antigen (“TumorAg ON” or “TumorAg OFF”), we found that TumorAg ON PDAC engendered more than 10-fold higher recruitment of neutrophils into liver metastatic lesions compared to TumorAg OFF PDAC. RNA sequencing analysis of micro-dissected metastatic lesions showed that TumorAg ON PDAC elicited transcription of genes associated with neutrophil chemotaxis, including Cxcr2 and its ligands. Multimodal immune phenotyping and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) analysis further revealed that neutrophils within metastatic lesions consisted of CXCR2high and CXCR2low subpopulations and were spatially associated with distinct subsets of tumor cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. In both mouse models of liver and lung metastasis, small molecule inhibition of CXCR2 using SX-682 led to enrichment of CXCR2low neutrophils and reduced metastatic burden in TumorAg ON PDAC. In contrast, CXCR2 inhibition had no impact on metastatic burden in TumorAg OFF PDAC. To define the subpopulations of neutrophils in further depth, we also performed single-cell spatial transcriptomics using Xenium. Notably, CXCR2 inhibition in TumorAg ON PDAC, but not in TumorAg OFF, led to enrichment of neutrophil subsets that expressed higher levels of Mpo, Nos2, and Ly6g and lower levels of Cxcr2 and Siglecf into metastatic lesions. In this setting, depletion of neutrophils using anti-Ly6G antibodies worsened metastatic burden, highlighting anti-tumor properties of these neutrophil subsets in the presence of antigenic recognition. Indeed, in a highly immune-resistant model of PDAC, 6419c5, the use of tumor-targeting listeria vaccine CRS-207 along with CXCR2 inhibition significantly reduced metastatic burden, whereas CXCR2 inhibitor or CRS-207 alone had no impact. To extend the clinical relevance of these observations, we analyzed serial tissue biopsies collected from patients with metastatic PDAC in the liver treated with immunotherapy regimen incorporating CRS-207 (NCT03190265). Consistent with our mouse model results, IMC analysis revealed increased proportion of MPOhigh NOS2high neutrophils upon treatment, suggesting that induction of tumor antigen response results in an effective remodeling of the neutrophil compartment . Taken together, our results show that neutrophils may acquire anti-tumor properties under appropriate inflammatory conditions and that distinct subpopulations of neutrophils may be leveraged for the treatment of metastatic disease.

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) orchestrates a profound disruption of immune balance within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. To better understand these complex immune dynamics, we used high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling to comprehensively characterize the immune landscape of the BM across different stages of myeloma progression, including MGUS (n = 16), smoldering MM (SMM; n = 25), and active MM, both newly diagnosed (n = 43) and relapsed/refractory (n = 104). Our analysis revealed substantial immune remodeling during disease progression, characterized by adaptive immune suppression and extensive infiltration of innate immune populations. Transformation from MGUS to SMM was marked by significant alterations in central and effector memory T helper cells, effector cytotoxic T cells, and an enrichment of monocytic and neutrophil subsets. Active MM stages were further distinguished by increased expansion of myeloid and monocytic lineages, alongside a pronounced reduction in progenitor and transitional B cells.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and heavily influence GBM biology, contributing to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, immune evasion, and neovascularization. Current in vitro models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a useful alternative to traditional models that can be used to study immune-interactions in vitro.

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Although effective for immunologically hot tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors minimally affect tumors that are not T cell inflamed, including breast cancer. An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage. In summary, we describe a class of neutrophils, educated by the combined action of inflammatory mediators and metabolic inhibitors, having tumoricidal functions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are marked by systemic inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, lymphopenia, and chronic immune dysfunction, with limited therapeutic options for recovery. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection, mirrors these immune pathologies, providing a valuable translational model. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy combined with antiviral treatment in cats with effusive FIP. Hematologic, virologic, and immunologic analyses were conducted over 12 weeks. Antiviral therapy reduced cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by downregulating inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. MSC-treated cats demonstrated enhanced immune recovery, evidenced by reduced expression of exhaustion-related transcription factors (IKZF2, ZEB2, PRDM1) and increased regulatory T-cell populations, promoting immune homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes revealed transcriptomic shifts indicative of immune rejuvenation, including elevated memory T-cell markers (IKZF1, GZMK, IL7R) and reduced hyperproliferative lymphocyte subsets. Serum cytokine analysis revealed 3 distinct inflammatory mediator patterns using principal component analysis. Both treatment groups showed transitions toward cytokine profiles resembling those of healthy controls. Notably, residual cytokine elevations persisted at the study’s end, mirroring features of chronic immune dysregulation. PDGF-bb, a marker of tissue repair, was uniquely associated with higher lymphocyte counts, suggesting its role in lymphoid recovery. This study highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction and support durable immune recovery. The findings underscore its translational relevance for addressing severe viral diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, advancing both veterinary and human medicine.">

        <tr id="Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a critical therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, relapse remains a major challenge, with limited effective options for managing post-transplant recurrence. Tumor cells escape immune surveillance by establishing a complex, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a central role in immune evasion and disease relapse. Understanding the TME’s impact on immune cells and their functional alterations is therefore of significant clinical importance. Methods Utilizing a non-irradiated AML mouse model and bioinformatic analysis, we systematically analyzed T-cell dynamics during AML progression and identified abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells at early disease stages, which correlated with leukemia cell immune evasion. Result We found that when major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on AML cells were haplomatched with immune cells, CD8+ T cells exhibited robust cytokine and cytotoxic activation, retaining immune profiles similar to those of normal T cells. However, under the same tumor burden, T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, showed dramatic metabolic gene activation in MHC-matched leukemic mice. This metabolic activation led to rapid exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, accelerating leukemia progression. Based on these activated metabolic genes, we established a metabolism-associated genes (MAGs) scoring system. Validation using public datasets revealed that a high MAG score is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Conclusions Our findings provide molecular evidence supporting the stronger graft-versus-leukemia effects observed in HLA haploidentical HSCT. Moreover, they highlight that abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells during early AML progression contributes to rapid disease advancement and poor prognosis.

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immune-based agents, especially Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI), are standard of care therapy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC); however, a significant number of patient tumors fail to respond, or develop resistance. While target expression, mutation burden and oncogenic pathways impact responses, an established mechanism contributing to ICI therapy failure is evasion of T-cell responses via downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Conversely, natural killer (NK) cells eQector function is enhanced in the absence of HLA, making NK cellular therapies an attractive option for ICI resistant tumors. Challenges for current NK cell therapies include failure to adequately infiltrate solid tumors and long-term persistence, which may be overcome by deploying NK-derived extracellular vesicles (NKEVs) as a personalized novel adoptive cellular therapeutic with cytotoxic effects. Methods In a human NSCLC cohort (n=10), we used single cell RNAseq and antibody labeling (CITEseq) to examine the immune cell landscape in peripheral immune cells (PBMCs) and tumors. NKEVs retrieved from patient NK cells were characterized with proteomics and bulk RNAseq, and EV functionality was assessed using primary tumor organoids. Results We identified circulating NK cell subsets, describing diQerences in cell composition, gene expression and signaling, related to time point, NSCLC subtype (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell), composition and tumor grade. Next, we examined the functional capabilities of patient NKEVs in organoid structures derived from primary tumor cells, finding that exposure to patient NKEVs resulted in a 40-45% decrease in organoid viability, and significantly lowered the cisplatin dose required to elicit cytotoxicity. In Nivolumab treated PBMC co-culture experiments, NKEV addition favorably shifted the organoid infiltrating immune population to significantly fewer CD4+ T cells and more CD56+ NK cells. Finally, we used the multi-omic characterization of NKEV molecular cargo to identify RNA transcripts and proteins associated with cytotoxic and immune recruiting functions. Conclusions This work demonstrated that NKEVs can be successfully harvested from patient derived, expanded NK cells, and highlights their heterogeneous cargo, and anti-tumor properties in combination with standard-of-care therapies.">

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 29,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Angus cattle stratified by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a proxy for the cellular immune response (Cell-IR). Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity. Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat highlighted pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, particularly the IL-1β– IL-1R1 ligand-receptor interactions.

        <tr id="Introduction During gestation the immune system undergoes dramatic remodelling to protect the maternal-fetal dyad from infections whilst also preventing fetal rejection. We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 modifies the immune landscape during infection and in recovered pregnant women. Methods We immunophenotyped our two independent geographical cohorts using a 14-colour flow cytometry panel (surface and intracellular staining). We estimated cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in validation cohort using a multiplexd flow cytometry panel. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed using a Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead Chip and Library Kit from 10x Genomics (Drop-seq method). Furthermore, we estimated the cytotoxic functions of natural killer (NK) cells by flow cytometry using surface and intracellular staining. Results Using two independent geographical cohorts, we identified that NK cells had a sustained reduction during active infection and after recovery. Further, scRNA-seq data revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 rewired the gene expression profile of NK, monocytes, CD4+, CD8+ effector T cells and antibody producing B cells in convalescent pregnant women. Several gene pathways associated with cytotoxic function, interferon signalling type I & II, and pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were attenuated in recovered pregnant patients compared with healthy pregnancies. We validated our scRNA-seq of NK cells from convalescent pregnant women and confirmed that NK cells had diminished levels of cytotoxic proteins; perforin, CD122 and granzyme B. Discussion Overall, our study uncovers that SARS-CoV-2 infection deranges the adaptive immune response in pregnant women even after recovery and may contribute to post-COVID19 sequalae of symptoms.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-Glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of central trained immunity by reprogramming haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan in mice induces peripheral trained immunity by reprogramming AMs in the lungs, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) or viral (polyI:C) challenges via a neutrophil/IFN-γ-dependent manner. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a major global health challenge due to its high incidence and mortality rates, emphasizing the critical need for innovative therapeutic strategies. IL-1R2, a member of the IL-1 receptor family, plays a pivotal role in both tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity. However, its precise role in tumor development and its impact on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy in CRC remain poorly understood. We examined tumor progression in wild-type and IL-1R2-deficient mice using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer model treated with combined ICIs therapy. Our findings revealed that IL-1R2 deficient mice exhibited a significant reduction in tumor burden, accompanied by alterations in the carcinogenic program and enhanced immunogenicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, the deletion of IL-1R2 resulted in an increased proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells, a population commonly enriched for tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting an augmentation of tumor-specific immune responses. Moreover, IL-1R2 deletion upregulated genes linked to antigen presentation in dendritic cells, indicating enhanced activation of the adaptive immune system. Collectively, these findings position IL-1R2 as a promising therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of treatment strategies in CRC.

        <tr id="Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

In contrast, the second cluster with elevated Cd244 and type 2 immune response but reduced maturation markers primarily emerges in the peripheral blood and spleens of specific disease scenarios.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT During chronic HIV-1 infection, the upregulation of immune checkpoints (ICs) on lymphocytes contributes to persistent immune dysfunction, T-cell exhaustion, and inadequate virological control, highlighting the potential role of ICs in HIV functional cure strategy. Despite extensive research on ICs, the expression dynamics and immunological impact of ICs in natural HIV/SHIV infection, particularly among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free elite controllers (ECs), remain poorly understood. In this study, we monitored a cohort of SHIVSF162P3-infected rhesus macaques (RMs), identifying four ECs and four progressors (PGs) through longitudinal evaluation. We observed low-level expression of ICs in both peripheral blood and lymph nodes of ECs, characterized by a particularly pronounced restriction in the expression of TIGIT and BTLA. This attenuated IC profile correlated with enhanced T-cell functionality, reduced exhaustion markers, and reduced viral reservoirs in peripheral and lymphoid tissues. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that TIGIT is a critical checkpoint marker involved in multiple synergistic cofunctions related to HIV/SIV-specific immune regulation. Collectively, our findings establish a dual role for ICs in perpetuating T-cell exhaustion and viral reservoir persistence, paving the way for IC blockade in future HIV cure strategies. IMPORTANCE Rhesus macaques spontaneously controlling simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) without antiretroviral therapy have low-level expression of immune molecules (ICs), characterized by TIGIT and BTLA. These molecules are linked to enhanced immune function and reduced viral presence in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that TIGIT is a critical checkpoint marker involved in multiple synergistic cofunctions related to HIV/SIV-specific immune regulation in both humans and macaques. Blocking TIGIT improved polyfunctional T-cell responses, thereby offering a potential new treatment strategy and providing critical insights for developing a functional HIV cure.">

        <tr id="Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common herpesvirus, establishes lifelong latency and increases in prevalence with age; yet its systemic impact on the aging immune system remains incompletely understood. We profiled circulating immune cells from healthy older adults (median age: 73) who were CMV(+) or CMV(-) using single-cell RNA-sequencing and validated key findings by flow cytometry. CMV(+) individuals exhibited significant expansion of adaptive immune cells: CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ TEMRA T, GZMK+ CD8⁺ T, γδ T, and atypical B cells. Among innate immune cells, monocytes and dendritic cells remained largely unchanged while KLRC2+ (adaptive) NK cells increased and CD56dim NK cells decreased. To facilitate CMV assessment in datasets with unknown CM serostatus, we developed CMVerify, a machine learning classifier that accurately predicts CMV serostatus from single-cell data across platforms and age groups (97% accuracy). These findings reveal extensive CMV-associated immune remodeling in older adults and underscore the importance of incorporating CMV status in studies of immune aging.">

Here, we use an Il15 knockin reporter and multiple conditional deletion mouse models to show distinct differences in IL-15 expression between BM MSC subtypes. Conditional deletion of Il15 in Osx+ stromal cells results in decreased natural killer (NK) cell precursors, memory CD8+ T cells and NKT cells but not mature NK cells. Lepr+ stromal cells support the survival of mature NK cells and memory CD8+ T cells in the BM of older mice, while endothelial cells support mature NK cells and memory CD8+ T cells in the blood but not in the BM. Thus, our data suggest that MSC subtypes differentially regulate the development and survival of IL-15-dependent immune cell lineages in the BM.">

        <tr id="Multiple mechanisms of immunity must be coordinated to defend against a comprehensive range of pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which broad-spectrum antipathogens act remain largely elusive. Here, we employed systems biology approaches to understand the organization of human immune cells at the single-cell level, as well as their reorganization in response to K21, a silane derivative effective against viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. K21 induced pro-inflammatory pathways in M1 and M2c macrophages without altering cytokine secretion, decreased a specific subtype of M1 macrophages and CXCL4-induced M2-like macrophages, and improved mitochondrial health by enhancing mitochondrial recycling via mitophagy. Similar treatment of the in vivo model organism C. elegans induced mitophagy and extended lifespan, suggesting evolutionary conservation of mechanism. Our work demonstrates that a drug that remodels mitochondria and metabolism can shape the immune cell repertoire, which could aid the development of more effective antimicrobials and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.">

        <tr id="TIGIT is an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor on T cells and NK cells that mediates immunosuppressive effects by binding to ligands on malignant or antigen-presenting cells. In colorectal cancer (CRC), immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 show therapeutic promise, but many patients experience resistance or relapse. Therefore, identifying robust immune biomarkers for predicting disease progression and therapeutic response is critical. Analysis of transcriptomic data from CRC patients revealed that high TIGIT expression is associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival. TIGIT expression also correlated with immune infiltration, particularly CD8+ T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a distinct subset of TIGIT+PD-1+CXCL13+ CD8+ T cells enriched in CRC patients. In vitro co-culture experiments confirmed that this phenotype is induced by tumor cells, suggesting a tumor-driven mechanism of T cell dysfunction. This TIGIT+PD-1+CXCL13+ CD8+ T cell population may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapy response in CRC.">

        <tr id="Transcriptional Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is a hallmark of aggressive cancers, yet how transcriptional ITH programs drive tumor metastasis and immune evasion in upper aerodigestive squamous cell carcinoma (UASCC) remains unclear. Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of UASCC cells and patient tumors, we uncovered a hybrid epithelial mesenchymal transition (hEMT) ITH program linked to metastatic dissemination. The transcription factor ETS1 was identified as a master regulator of the hEMT program, directly activating pro-metastatic genes and promoting distant spread in vivo. Unexpectedly, ETS1 also orchestrated an immune-cold tumor microenvironment by transcriptionally activating both STAT1 and PD-L1 (CD274) genes, suppressing T lymphocyte infiltration, and elevating immune checkpoint molecules. Clinically, ETS1-high tumors strongly correlated with poor survival and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade across multiple cohorts. Leveraging drug screens, we discovered that ETS1-high cancers are vulnerable to HSP90 inhibitors (e.g., Alvespimycin), which suppress ETS1 by disrupting HIF1A-mediated transcriptional activation. Together, our work reveals ETS1 as a dual driver of tumor distal metastasis and immune evasion in UASCC, while nominating HSP90 inhibition as a tailored treatment strategy for ETS1-driven tumors. These findings provide a roadmap for targeting aggressive ITH subsets and overcoming immunotherapy resistance.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are central orchestrators of antitumor immunity, bridging innate sensing with adaptive T‐cell responses. This review dissects the developmental pathways and functional specializations of diverse DC subsets—including cDC1, cDC2, pDCs, DC3s, tDCs, moDCs, and emerging RORγt+ antigen‐presenting cells (APCs)—and explores how the tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically reprograms these cells. Immunosuppressive cytokines, metabolic stress, hypoxia, and altered lipid metabolism can induce tolerogenic phenotypes such as mregDCs and ISG+ DCs, dampening antigen presentation and T‐cell activation. We detail how specific DC subsets interact with the TME—either reinforcing immune evasion or promoting antitumor immunity—depending on their transcriptional states and spatial organization. Emphasis is placed on recent findings from spatial transcriptomics and single‐cell studies that reveal key DC–T cell niches critical for immune control. Furthermore, we evaluate current and emerging therapeutic strategies that aim to restore DC functionality or exploit their antigen‐presenting capabilities, including mRNA vaccines, receptor‐targeted delivery, CD40 agonists, and in situ cellular reprogramming. By integrating mechanistic insights with clinical advances, this review underscores the potential of context‐aware, subset‐specific DC interventions to overcome immune suppression and enhance cancer immunotherapy. Impact statement By dissecting the complexity and plasticity of dendritic cell subsets in cancer, our work offers novel insights into their reprogramming by the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic exploitation, paving the way for next‐generation, context‐aware immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play dual roles in cancer, either promoting or suppressing tumor progression, complicating therapeutic approaches. TAMs include recruited macrophages (recMacs), derived from circulating monocytes, and tissue-resident interstitial macrophages (IMs). We recently identified a heterogeneous population of chemokine-expressing IMs, including subsets that support tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation during lung inflammation. Here, we show that IMs can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic, depending on the subset. Using Pf4 Cx3cr1 mice to deplete CD206hi IMs expressing Cxcl13, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, we demonstrate their essential role in TLS formation, lymphocyte recruitment, and tumor suppression in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Ccl2-expressing IMs promote tumor growth by recruiting pro-tumorigenic recMacs. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the distinct localization and chemokine profiles of these subsets. Finally, CCR5 blockade with the FDA-approved inhibitor Maraviroc during neoantigen vaccination improved tumor control by preventing the migration of immunosuppressive, antigen-presenting recMacs (moDCs). These findings support the development of macrophage-targeted therapies by identifying pro-tumorigenic subsets and recMac trafficking as actionable targets, while preserving macrophage populations that sustain anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains a significant public health burden. One of the most personalized treatments uses a patient’s own tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and TIL activity is also essential for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness. Responses to immunotherapies vary due to immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and limited antigen presentation. In this study, we computationally examine cell-cell signaling and transcriptional activity using single-cell RNA sequencing of lung cancer treated by inhibiting methyltransferase EZH2. We show that EZH2 inhibition shifts the TME to immunogenic signaling patterns conducive to increased T cell response, including antigen presentation and homing. T cells also showed more stem-like phenotypes. Transcriptional activity was quieter with EZH2 inhibition but revealed better interferon response, altered myeloid and B cell differentiation, and apoptotic markers. Importantly, inferred EZH2 activity showed it could perform non-methyltransferase duties vital for T cell differentiation. These results indicate that EZH2 inhibition could improve immunotherapies for lung cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with the glycoprotein (GP) of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (VSV-GP) represents a potent oncolytic virus (OV). Oncolytic virotherapy is an emerging anticancer approach that uses viruses to eliminate cancer cells by direct cell lysis and induction of an antitumor immune response. Immunomodulatory cargos expressed by OVs hold the potential to further enhance this antitumor immune response. Methods To evaluate interleukin-12 (IL-12) as an immunomodulatory cargo encoded by VSV-GP, we used a subcutaneous tumor model by mixing type I interferon (IFN) competent murine lung epithelial cells (TC-1), which are largely resistant to VSV-GP in vivo, with VSV-GP permissive IFN-α receptor knockout TC-1 cells (TC-1ifnar1−/−). Results This mixed model supports prolonged viral replication and subsequent IL-12 production. Oncolytic virotherapy with VSV-GP and VSV-GP-IL12 of parental TC-1 tumors did not lead to tumor control, whereas virus treatment in the TC-1/TC-1ifnar1−/− mixed tumors showed prolonged survival. Furthermore, VSV-GP-IL12 was even more effective than VSV-GP treatment. Analysis of CD8+ T cell responses revealed phenotypic differences of activated CD8+ T cells between VSV-GP and VSV-GP-IL-12 treatment, whereby VSV-GP-IL12-induced CD8+T cells displayed a phenotype described for long-lived effector cells (LLEC). Depletion experiments indicated that CD8+ T cells, and not NK cells, were responsible for the improved efficacy observed with VSV-GP-IL12 treatment. Conclusions Taken together, we have demonstrated that oncolytic virotherapy using VSV-GP encoding IL-12 induces CD8+ T cell responses characterized by an LLEC phenotype, a cell population that is likely a crucial component of antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Viral and bacterial lung infections place a significant burden on public health. Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican’s potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host’s immune response to lung infection. However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

        <tr id="High-grade serous ovarian cancer demonstrates limited responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors, owing in part to immunosuppressive environments shaped by nearly universal p53 aberrations. Utilizing an immunocompetent mouse model and individual p53 mutations, we identified a dependence of the p53-R270H mutation (equivalent of human R273H) on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Analysis of patient datasets associated R273H with elevated levels of two p53 targets, PD-L1 and amphiregulin (AREG), a Tregs growth factor. In contrast to p53-R172H tumors, where there was limited activity, dual antibody therapy targeting AREG and PD-L1 selectively and effectively inhibited R270H tumors. This involved polarization toward M1 macrophages, infiltration of CD8+ T cells, diminished Ly6G+ neutrophils and downregulation of interleukin-4. In patient-derived R273C organoids, the combination treatment reduced the CD4/CD8 ratio. This study is the first to establish a mutation-tailored therapeutic approach that leverages the capacity of p53 to modulate immunosuppressive mechanisms.">

However, the response to the BM altered status at the level of the HSC/MPP compartment in terms of lineage commitment has not been investigated. Bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing reveal that Bthal HSCs/MPPs are expanded and activated with enhanced priming along the whole Ery differentiation trajectory. Consistently, HSC/MPP showed an altered TGFβ expression and autophagy transcriptional signatures along with a declined dormancy state. We discovered that the altered TGFβ signaling fosters the Ery potential of HSCs by reducing their autophagic levels, and in vivo stimulation of autophagy is sufficient to rescue the imbalance of the HSC compartment.

We identified four macrophage subtypes, including one highly susceptible to infection and another with antiviral properties that is rapidly destroyed. The viral E165R gene was essential for ASFV replication while disrupting host defense signals. By tracking cellular changes, we revealed how macrophages drive ASFV progression.

        <tr id="Background Intrinsically resistant glioma stem cells (GSCs) in the setting of a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remain the most predominant phenomenon leading to unfavorable therapeutic outcomes in glioblastoma (GBM). Hence there is an unmet need for novel anti-GBM therapeutic paradigms that can effectively target GSCs while simultaneously reprogramming the TME. Methods In this study, we leverage evidence from SMAC mimetic screening to evaluate and characterize the anti-tumor and immune TME modulating impacts of the lead SMAC mimetic Xevinapant at the single cell level in GBM. We utilized viability assays and orthotopic human and murine GBM models to assess the survival impacts of Xevinapant on GSCs in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the modulation impact of Xevinapant on GBM TME. Lastly, we investigated drug combination synergies to address potential mechanisms of tolerance or resistance to Xevinapant. Results According to our observations, in vitro exposure to Xevinapant induced apoptosis along with significant viability reduction in a dose-dependent manner, in both human and mouse GSCs. Moreover, Xevinapant treatment produced robust anti-tumor effects in vivo and significantly prolonged animal overall survival. Based on single-cell RNA seq analysis, Xevinapant did not only enhance GSCs apoptosis but also activated antitumor effector immune response leading to favorable reprogramming of immunosuppressive TME. Furthermore, we established and queried Xevinapant therapeutic signatures to the LINCS database in an effort to identify small molecules that could reverse treatment-induced tolerance to Xevinapant. We have identified a novel set of candidate small molecules with robust synergy when combined with Xevinapant. Conclusions In summary, Xevinapant exhibits robust anti-tumor activity on GSCs and favorable immune modulation of the TME in GBM, hence providing a rationale for further clinical investigation in GBM.

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a debilitating neglected tropical disease characterized by lesions that can range from self-healing to permanent disfigurations. A predominant Th1 response, which stimulates IFN-γ production, is crucial for parasite control during self-healing CL. While IFN-γ primarily activates macrophages to produce nitric oxide via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) leading to parasite control, IFN-γ also activates other downstream pathways involved in cell autonomous immunity. One such pathway is the activation of guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), a class of interferon inducible GTPases. However, the role of GBPs during CL has been minimally explored. Utilizing RNA-Seq we found that Leishmania major infection leads to the upregulation of several GBPs in C57Bl/6 mice. In vitro studies using GBPChr3 knockout (KO), and C57Bl/6 control mice reveal that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from KO mice exhibit higher parasite burdens following IFN-γ treatment, independent of GBP localization to the parasite. Single-cell RNA-Seq identifies macrophages as the primary expressers of GBPs during L. major infection in vivo. In vivo, GBPChr3 KO mice display increased disease severity and parasite load. GBPChr3 KO macrophages and monocytes show elevated ARG-1 and reduced iNOS expression, indicating a shift toward a parasite-permissive environment that supports parasite growth. These findings highlight a critical role for GBPs in immune-mediated control of CL.">

Consequently, the functional properties of these cells remain poorly characterized. In this study, we show that cultured common lymphoid progenitors (cCLPs) differentiate into CD11b⁺CD115⁺ monocytic cells (cCLP-Ms) via IL-6-C/EBPβ signaling. Molecular and phenotypic analyses revealed that cCLP-Ms acquire essential features of myeloid cells, including innate immune sensor expression and phagocytic capacity, while retaining unique characteristics distinct from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), such as reduced MHC class II expression and TNF-α production. Functionally, cCLP-Ms exhibit immunoregulatory properties, effectively suppressing IgE-mediated cutaneous allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer. These findings highlight the plasticity of lymphoid progenitors and establish a robust platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying myeloid differentiation. This system deepens our understanding of hematopoietic cell lineage flexibility and offers a foundation for exploring therapeutic applications in immune regulation and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neonates have increased vulnerability to life-threatening infections due to the distinct immune landscape. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a key component of this immune profile that we have previously shown to be elevated in both newborn humans and mice. IL-27 continues to increase in the serum and tissues consistent with poor outcomes during gram-negative neonatal bacterial sepsis. Presently, we dissected the IL-27 producer profile at a single-cell level using IL-27p28eGFP reporter mice in our previously established model of neonatal sepsis with luciferase-expressing K1-encapsulated Escherichia coli. Whole animal imaging regionally highlighted the spleen, liver, and lungs as key infection sites by bacterial luminescence. Flow cytometry showed that IL-27 producers increased significantly in the liver with infection and were predominantly F4/80+ and CD11b+ with subpopulations that emerged expressing additional markers. This information paired with single-cell RNA sequencing further identified the most robust populations as monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and Kupffer cells followed by smaller populations of dendritic cells and neutrophils. The transcriptome demonstrated a diverse range of functionality amongst populations that included differential expression of genes implicated in bactericidal, metabolic, and inflammatory changes. Collectively, the transcriptome of IL-27 producers from the livers of infected animals suggests an uncoordinated mix of inflammatory and suppressive activity that may contribute to immune dysregulation characteristic of sepsis. Together, this work provides previously undescribed insight into the details of IL-27 producers during early-life infection. This further provides essential information needed to support IL-27 as a therapeutic target for neonatal bacterial sepsis.">

Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling can trigger necroptosis, orchestrating immune responses to solid tumors.

Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition. Exploiting these findings, we showed that a combination therapy activating RIPK3 with SMAC mimetics while suppressing caspase activity and providing type I IFN resulted in immune-mediated control of B cell tumors. Hence, reprogramming RIPK3 activity represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity to target B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an effective treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, yet the mechanisms underlying immune reset and sustained remission remain incompletely understood. This study provides a longitudinal immune profiling of patients undergoing AHSCT, with a specific focus on immune reconstitution at two years post-AHSCT. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at baseline and multiple time points post-AHSCT. Immune reconstitution was characterized using high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to assess phenotypic changes in B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. Results AHSCT led to profound alterations in immune cell populations. B-cell recovery was marked by a rapid expansion of naïve B cells, while memory B cells and plasmablasts remained depleted. Notably, patients with evidence of inflammatory disease activity (EIDA) post-AHSCT exhibited higher pre-transplant frequencies of non-switched IgD+IgM+ memory B cells, raising the possibility of a potential biomarker for treatment response. Myeloid-cell reconstitution showed a decline in classical monocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially shifting the immune balance toward a more tolerogenic state. CD4 T-cell reconstitution demonstrated a shift from central memory (Tcm) to effector memory (Tem) phenotypes, with a selective depletion of polyfunctional Th1/Th17cells lacking PD-1 expression. Clusters enriched for PD-1+ Tem CD4 T cells appeared to differ between patients with and without EIDA. Furthermore, an increase in atypical naïve CCR7⁻CD62L⁻ CD4 T cells was observed in EIDA patients, raising questions about their role in the pathophysiology of MS. CD8 T-cell reconstitution followed a similar pattern, with a shift from a naïve/Tcm-dominant to a Tem-skewed population, albeit with substantial interpatient variability. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells showed a sustained decrease, possibly reflecting microbiota alterations post-transplant. Conclusions Taken together, these findings provide an exploratory characterization of immune reconstitution following AHSCT, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms that warrant validation in larger cohorts to guide patient stratification and monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="Tumor immunosuppression remains a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy and is often driven by the immunoregulatory activities of innate immune cells, such as myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Myeloid populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—play pivotal roles in dampening anti-tumor immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Recent advances in our understanding of myeloid cell biology have unveiled new therapeutic opportunities to disrupt these immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with tumor inflammation. This review highlights key signaling pathways and surface molecules involved in myeloid-mediated immune suppression, including CSF1R, PI3Kγ, mTOR, Syk, MerTK/Axl, and immune checkpoints such as Trem2, LILRBs, VISTA, and CD40. We examine preclinical and clinical findings that support targeting these pathways to reprogram the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. By integrating insights from mechanistic studies and therapeutic development, this review underscores the potential of myeloid cell-targeting strategies as promising adjuncts to current cancer immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges in translating these approaches into durable clinical benefit.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, its impact on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, the murine CD24 gene, in tumor progression and TME immune dynamics in a murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model. Methods Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 knockout technology was employed to generate CD24a knockout in the murine TNBC cell line 4T1. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the immune cell populations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow in the orthotopic mouse 4T1 breast cancer model. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect the immune cells in tumor sections. High-speed confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of immune cells in the 4T1 orthotopic tumors. Results Knocking out CD24a significantly reduced tumor growth kinetics and prolonged mouse survival in vivo. Flow cytometry and IF analysis of tumor samples revealed that CD24a loss significantly promoted the infiltration of M1 macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into the TME while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs). In vitro coculture experiments showed that CD24a deficiency significantly enhanced macrophage‐mediated phagocytosis and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, effects that were partially reversed by re‐expression of CD24a. Moreover, in vivo depletion of macrophages and CD8+ T cells reverted the delayed tumor growth caused by CD24a knockout, underscoring their critical role in tumor growth suppression associated with CD24a knockout. 3D mapping of immune cells in the TME confirmed the anti-tumor immune landscape in the CD24a knockout 4T1 tumors. Furthermore, in vitro analysis showed that CD24a loss upregulated macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression while suppressed levels of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL10, chemokines known to recruit gMDSCs, further providing a molecular basis for enhanced macrophage recruitment and diminished gMDSC accumulation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that CD24a may regulate immune suppression within the TNBC TME. Targeting CD24a enhances macrophage- and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and is associated with a shift in the TME toward a more immunogenic state, thereby suppressing tumor growth. These results may support CD24 as a promising immunotherapeutic target for TNBC.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT NK cells are critical for immunosurveillance, yet become dysfunctional when chronically stimulated by virally infected or cancerous cells. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less characterized, limiting therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, with remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3‐expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating, and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of these cells in connective tissue diseases. Conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exhibit distinct contributions to disease progression. In systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, pDCs primarily drive pathogenesis via excessive type I interferon production, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cDCs play a major role in promoting autoreactive T cell activation. Emerging DC subsets, such as inflammatory DC3s and LAMP3+ DCs, have been implicated in RA synovitis. In vasculitis, tissue-resident vascular DCs appear to regulate localized inflammation. Despite advances in single-cell analysis, the functional roles of specific DC subsets remain underexplored in several autoimmune conditions.

        <tr id="Achieving a cure is an urgent need for patients with advanced solid tumors. Here, we discover that oncolytic virus (OV) infection enhances IL-18 receptor expression but fails to increase IL-18 ligand expression. Therefore, we engineer armed oncolytic alphavirus M1 expressing wild-type IL-18 (wtIL-18) or a mutant variant (mutIL-18) that evades IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) while maintaining IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) binding. Intravenous administration of M1-mutIL-18 suppresses the growth of multiple advanced solid tumors in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse models and promotes long-term systemic immune memory. Mechanistically, armed M1-mutIL-18 enhances directed clonal expansion and differentiation of CD8+ T cells and sustains IFN-γ production. Thus, armed M1-mutIL-18 promotes dendritic cell (DC) activation, priming and activation of CD8+ T cells in lymphatic organs, and infiltration of IL-18R+ CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, establishing a positive feedback loop. We further show that a PD-L1 inhibitor enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of mutIL-18 OVs. These results highlight the importance of the IL-18 pathway in oncolytic virus therapy and implicate reprogramming ligand-receptor interaction as an effective strategy for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms by which Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) infection leads to acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a severe neurological condition characterized by sudden muscle weakness and paralysis, remain poorly understood. To investigate the cellular tropism and infection dynamics of EV-D68, we profiled naive and EV-D68-infected human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs). Upon infection with two EV-D68 strains, US/IL/14-18952 (a B2 strain) and US/MA/18-23089 (a B3 strain), we observed distinct viral tropism and host transcriptional responses. Notably, US/IL/14-18952 showed a significant preference for neurons, while US/MA/18-23089 exhibited higher rates of infection in cycling astrocytes and OPCs. These findings provide novel insights into the host cell tropism of EV-D68 in the spinal cord, offering insight into the potential mechanisms underlying AFM pathogenesis. Understanding the dynamics of infection at single-cell resolution will inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the neurological impact of enteroviral infections.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (nICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet the underlying mechanisms of resistance in bladder cancer remain to be explored. Methods We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tumor tissues, adjacent normal tissues, and metastatic lymph nodes from 2 nICB-naïve and 10 nICB-treated patients with bladder cancer (5 responders and 5 non-responders). Spatial RNA sequencing was performed on tumor slides from two responders and four non-responders. Findings were validated by multiplex immunohistochemistry, mice orthotopic bladder cancer model, and flow cytometry assays. Results nICB remodeled the tumor microenvironment of bladder cancer from both single-cell and spatial perspectives. scRNA-seq analysis revealed a significant increase in MYBL2hi cancer stem cells (CSCs) among non-responders. Analysis of the myeloid population showed that SPP1+ macrophages associated with angiogenesis were linked to CD8+ T cell exclusion. Further investigation into cell–cell communication revealed a propensity for bidirectional crosstalk between MYBL2hi CSCs and SPP1+ macrophages in non-responders. MYBL2hi CSCs derived CCL15, which bound to CCR1 and induced SPP1 upregulation in macrophages which reciprocally enhanced bladder cancer stemness and resistance to nICB through the SPP1-ITGα9β1 axis. Additionally, we identified an aged CCL3+ neutrophil population that interacted with SPP1+ macrophages through a positive feedback loop, contributing to nICB resistance. Finally, in vivo studies demonstrated that combined MYBL2 knockdown and SPP1 targeting synergistically enhanced ICB efficacy in bladder cancer. Conclusions Our research reveals transcriptomic characteristics associated with distinct therapeutic responses to nICB treatment, offering a foundation for optimizing personalized neoadjuvant strategies in bladder cancer.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) significantly contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and targeted inhibition of MDSCs is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. Here, we identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a critical regulator of MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression in breast cancer. The present study demonstrates that MARCO is expressed on MDSCs, and breast tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) enriched with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promote MDSC differentiation and amplify immunosuppressive activity by up-regulating MARCO. Genetic ablation of MARCO in a murine breast cancer model attenuated tumor growth, accompanied by reduced monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and total tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), along with enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, we developed a specific MARCO down-regulation-promoting monoclonal antibody that impeded TDE-induced MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression. In vivo, MARCO down-regulating antibody suppressed tumor growth and reprogrammed the TME by diminishing immunosuppressive MDSCs and TAMs and revitalizing CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Strikingly, combining the MARCO down-regulating antibody with PD-1 blockade synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. This work establishes MARCO as a key regulator of MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and presents a compelling case for the inclusion of MARCO as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases. Our findings may provide new clues for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and help identify optimal biomarkers for new therapeutic strategies.

We first discuss the evolution of brain-immune concepts, from early notions of immune privilege to modern understandings of brain-border immune niches (meninges, choroid plexus, and perivascular spaces). These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes. Furthermore, we highlight emerging MS immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T regimens, mesenchymal stem cell interventions, microbiome modulation, and nanodelivery systems, which strategically target mechanistic nodes spanning neuroimmune niche regulation, inflammatory cascade blockade, and CNS neurorestorative capacities.">

        <tr id="Both intrinsic and microenvironmental factors contribute to the genesis and progression of leukemia. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important members of the immunomicroenvironment. The immature DCs (imDCs) and regulatory DCs (DCregs) participate in the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that play adverse role in tumor progression. However, the characteristics of DCs in leukemia microenvironment have not been well established. Here, we identified a novel CD11c+MHCIIlo DC population (T-DC) accumulated in the mouse splenic T-ALL microenvironment. T-DCs exhibited an immature phenotype as they were characterized by low expression of MHCII molecules and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86, CD83 and CD40. Database analysis revealed that low level expression of DC maturation-associated genes correlated with poor prognosis in leukemia patients. Furthermore, T-DCs promoted T-ALL progression contributed by their attenuated phagocytosis and CD4+ T cell activation potential. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that T-DCs expressed low level of genes related to maturation and antigen processing. T-DCs showed similar expression pattern with DCregs and expressed high levels of immunosuppressive genes. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated the heterogeneity of T-DCs, showing that they are mainly compose of cDC1s, cDC2s and macrophage-like DCs. Therefore, our findings uncover the critical role of a novel imDC subset in promoting leukemia progression through the suppression of T-cell immunity. These results may have significant implications for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies aiming at reversing immune evasion in leukemia and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). As a receptor of prostaglandin D2, chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2) is known to be involved in Th2 cell activation, but its function in B lymphocytes is unclear. Here, we show that CRTH2 is critical for an IL-1β-producing B cell subset. Mice with B-cell-specific deletion of Crth2 exhibit reduced numbers of IL-1β-producing B cells, resulting in amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal animal model of MS. Compared to wild-type B cells, adoptive transfer of Crth2-deficient B cells attenuates EAE disease severity in B-cell-deficient recipient mice. The IL-1β-producing B cell subpopulation was mainly transitional type 2 B cells identified by flow cytometry and single cell sequencing. Mechanically, CRTH2 promotes IL-1β production in B cells through p38 signaling, and pharmacological inhibition of p38 attenuates EAE disease severity in DK-PGD2-treated mice. Taken together, our results reveal a key function of CRTH2 in driving IL-1β expression in B cells and in controlling their pathogenic activity in autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Background Influenza viruses with pandemic potential and possible burden of post-viral sequelae are a global concern. To prepare for future pandemics and the development of improved vaccines, it is vital to identify the immunological changes underlying influenza disease severity. Methods We combined unsupervised high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry with gene expression analyses, plasma CXCL13 measurements, and antigen-specific immune cell assays to characterize the immune profiles of hospitalized patients with severe and moderate seasonal influenza disease during active infection and at 6-month follow-up. We used age-matched healthy donors as controls. Results Severe disease was associated with a distinct immune profile, including lower frequencies of ICOS+ mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and CXCR5+ memory B and CD4+CXCR5+CD95+ICOS+ and CD8+CXCR3+CD95+PD-1+TIGIT+ memory T cells, as well as lower CD4 gene expression. Higher frequencies of CD16+CD161+ NK cells, CD169+ monocytes, CD123+/− dendritic cells, and CD38high plasma cells and high CXCL13 plasma levels were also associated with severe disease. Alterations in immune cell subpopulations persisted at convalescence for the severely ill patients only. Conclusions Our results indicated a reduction in regulatory MAIT cells and memory T and B cells and an increase in the inhibitory subpopulations of monocytes and NK cells in severe influenza that persisted at convalescence. These immune cell alterations were associated with higher age and the presence of several underlying conditions that may contribute to frailty. This study illustrates the power and sensitivity of high-dimensional single-cell analyses in identifying potential cellular biomarkers for disease severity after influenza infection.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor originating from hepatocytes, often developing against a backdrop of chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis. The primary risk factor for HCC is cirrhosis, and early detection is crucial for improving outcomes. Despite advances in treatment, the prognosis remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 15%-38%. Growing evidence highlights the critical role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in modulating tumor initiation, growth, progression, and, in some cases, suppression. The TME is a complex ecosystem composed of immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, extracellular matrix components, and other factors such as growth factors and cytokines. By shaping tumor cell behavior, the TME facilitates immune evasion and contributes to resistance to treatment. Tumor-associated immune cells, including regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, contribute to immune suppression and progression. On the other hand, immune activation via immune checkpoint inhibition has shown promise in improving outcomes, especially when combined with other treatments such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), and systemic therapies. Studies have demonstrated the potential of targeting the TME to enhance treatment efficacy, with immune modulation emerging as a key therapeutic strategy. This review explores the complex interactions within the TME in HCC, highlighting its role in therapy resistance and immune evasion. It also discusses current therapeutic approaches to target the TME to improve clinical outcomes in HCC patients.">

        <tr id="T cells are central players in the fight against cancer, capable of recognizing and destroying tumor cells. However, tumors often find ways to evade this immune response, creating challenges for effective treatment. In this review, we explore how different T cell subsets—including cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and unconventional T cells—contribute to tumor progression or suppression. We also delve into key mechanisms, such as immune checkpoints and metabolic pathways, that shape T cell behavior in the tumor microenvironment. Advances in cancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), T cell engagers (TCEs), adoptive T cell therapies (ACTs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, and cancer vaccines, have transformed cancer treatment and provided new hope for patients. However, challenges such as treatment resistance, limited efficacy in solid tumors, and therapy-associated toxicities remain significant barriers to broader clinical success. We discuss innovative strategies to tackle these challenges, including combination therapies and next-generation T cell engineering approaches. By connecting the biology of T cells with cutting-edge therapeutic advances, this review aims to inspire progress in the development of more effective and personalized cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic pathogen linked to neuropathogenesis in adults, causing conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and fatal encephalitis. Intracranial injection of virus in immunocompromised mice have shown neuroinflammation and subsequent brain damage. However, the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-induced neuroinflammation in immunocompetent adult mice via peripheral infection remain unclear. To investigate this, we utilized a murine model of ZIKV infection via footpad injection. Our findings reveal that acute ZIKV infection at 4 days post-infection (4 dpi) induces significant apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the adult brain, persisting up to 28 dpi. Notably, ZIKV infection triggers apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex—key regions involved in memory—and induces early immune cell infiltration. Additionally, microglial activation occurs following infection at 7 dpi, with viral RNA detected in the brain. Bulk RNA sequencing of the hippocampus at 28 dpi further reveals the activation of inflammatory pathways, underscoring the prolonged neuroinflammatory response in the infected brain. Microglial activation is likely driven by infiltrating monocytes, as inhibiting monocyte recruitment reduced the expression of microglial activation genes. These results suggest that targeting monocyte-induced inflammatory mediators could be potential therapeutic interventions for ZIKV.">

        <tr id="T cell responses are vital for controlling viral infection in the central nervous system (CNS), but must be tightly regulated to limit tissue-damaging inflammation. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) CNS infection, an in vivo model for JCPyV-induced Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), we investigated sites of early infection, immune responses, and recruitment of T cells to the brain. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) single-cell spatial transcriptomics was applied to assess the regionality of virus infection and brain-resident cell and infiltrating leukocyte responses. MERFISH, immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry demonstrate that the ependyma is the predominant region of MuPyV CNS infection and localization of T cells, and implicated CXCR4 and CXCR6 in T cell migration to the ependyma and subventricular zone. Using CXCR6 knockout mice and a specific CXCR4 small molecule antagonist, we found that the combined impairment of CXCR6 and CXCR4 signaling resulted in elevated infiltration of T cells in the MuPyV-infected brain. This work demonstrates that CXCR4 and CXCR6 act in a nonredundant fashion to restrict T cell accumulation to the polyomavirus-infected ependyma, with important implications for ongoing efforts to use JCPyV-specific T cell adoptive immunotherapy for PML.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment that importantly contributes to treatment resistance. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), which comprise approximately 50% of the cellular population within the GBM microenvironment, represent a major subset of tumor-associated macrophages. These cells drive tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, immune evasion, and the phenotypic transformation of tumor cells. MDM infiltration is mediated by specific signaling pathways and regulated by the disruption of the blood–brain barrier and tumor-associated hypoxia. Recent technological advances have uncovered substantial heterogeneity among macrophages, including hypoxia-induced, lipid-metabolizing, phagocytic, and interferon-activated subtypes. This functional diversity is shaped by tumor-specific genetic alterations and metabolic reprogramming. Therapeutic approaches focusing on MDMs include inhibiting their recruitment, enhancing phagocytic activity, employing genetically engineered macrophage, and modulating metabolic pathways. While preclinical studies suggest that these approaches may improve efficacy when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the dynamic spatiotemporal heterogeneity and adaptability of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment remain substantial therapeutic challenges. Future development in combination therapies, integrating single-cell multi-omics, spatial metabolic profiling, and targeted interventions, will be critical to precisely modulate MDMs, overcome immune tolerance, and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Chemotherapy is an integral part of the clinical management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, development of chemoresistance occurs frequently. Tumor sensitivity to treatment is known to be strongly influenced by the immune microenvironment, signifying the predictive potential of immune alterations. How tumor cells that acquire resistance may subsequently modulate the immune microenvironment it is still not well described. Here, we investigated immunomodulation in the context of acquired chemoresistance in TNBC, focusing on the role of the secretome. Methods Bulk RNA sequencing and multiplex cytokine profiling were performed on paclitaxel-resistant and -sensitive isogenic variants of TNBC cells to reveal resistance-associated secretome alterations. The immunomodulatory influence of the tumor cell secretome was investigated by exploring its effect on monocytes, macrophages (MΦs) and T cells derived from healthy blood donors. The influence on the immune cell phenotype and activity was evaluated by measuring molecular markers and performing functional assays. To validate the clinical relevance, we utilized longitudinal -omics data from breast cancer patients refractory to standard chemotherapy in the NeoAva clinical trial. CIBERSORT was applied to transcriptomics data to infer MΦ and T cell abundance in individual tumors upon treatment. To evaluate their association with the secretome profiles, patient-matched serum cytokine data were used. Results The acquisition of chemoresistance was accompanied by enhanced secretion of cytokines. Subsequently, the resistant cell secretome affected the abundance, phenotype and activity of immune cells. Specifically, it potentiated the recruitment of monocytes, facilitated the polarization of MΦs towards the immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype, and attenuated the activation of CD8+ T cells. Data from the NeoAva clinical cohort validated the enrichment of M2 MΦs and/or the depletion of M1 MΦs after treatment in the majority of residual tumors. The MΦ-associated changes counteracted CD8+ T cell abundance and were partially associated with the cytokine-enriched secretome. Conclusion Development of chemoresistance in BC is associated with alterations in the tumor secretome, which impairs immune activation and facilitates immunosuppression. Knowledge on the immune microenvironment in residual tumors after standard chemotherapy could aid in selecting rational treatment options for this group of patients.

Such immune-related adverse events (IrAE) contribute to hospitalizations, cancer treatment interruption, and even premature death. ICI-induced autoimmune diabetes mellitus (ICI-T1DM) is a life-threatening IrAE that presents with rapid pancreatic β-islet cell destruction leading to hyperglycemia and life-long insulin dependence. While prior reports have focused on CD8+ T cells, the role for CD4+ T cells in ICI-T1DM is less understood. We identify expansion of CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells expressing IL-21 and IFN-γ as a hallmark of ICI-T1DM. Furthermore, we show that both IL-21 and IFN-γ are critical cytokines for autoimmune attack in ICI-T1DM. Because IL-21 and IFN-γ both signal through JAK/STAT pathways, we reasoned that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) may protect against ICI-T1DM. Indeed, JAKi provide robust in vivo protection against ICI-T1DM in a mouse model that is associated with decreased islet-infiltrating Tfh cells. Moreover, JAKi therapy impaired Tfh cell differentiation in patients with ICI-T1DM. These studies highlight CD4+ Tfh cells as underrecognized but critical mediators of ICI-T1DM that may be targeted with JAKi to prevent this grave IrAE.">

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe, diffuse, progressive, and fibrosing interstitial disease leading to respiratory failure and death in the absence of organ transplantation. Substantial evidence has confirmed the pivotal role of fibroblasts in the progression of IPF, yet effective therapeutic options are scarce. Single-cell transcriptomics profiling revealed that among the diverse fibroblast subsets, FAP1+ alveolar fibroblasts (AFs) were pivotal for the progression of IPF. On the basis of these findings, we developed FAP1-targeting chimeric antigen receptor cytotoxic effector regulatory T cells (CAR-cTregs), which leveraged the targeted killing advantage of the currently trending CAR-based immunotherapy for tumors and incorporated the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs to mitigate the inflammation caused by both the disease itself and CAR-T cell infusion. Accordingly, CAR-cTregs were constructed to effectively eliminate FAP1+ fibroblasts in vitro. This cytotoxic effect could be abrogated by inhibitors of the granzyme B/perforin pathway. In the bleomycin-induced PF model, CAR-cTregs were found to reverse fibrosis characterized by diminished recruitment of fibrocytes and improved remodeling of epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate that CAR-cTregs can serve as a promising therapeutic option for IPF and provide an alternative strategy for treating multiple chronic inflammatory diseases by inducing both cytotoxicity and immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="CAR-T-cell therapy has made significant strides in treating hematological malignancies, yet its efficacy is often hampered by suboptimal T-cell functionality, marked by weak antitumor capabilities and a lack of durability. The immunological synapse, a key determinant of T-cell function, is influenced by the CD58-CD2 axis. The dynamic regulation of CD2 expression on T cells impacts the quality of CAR-mediated immunological synapses, affecting CAR-T-cell functional outcomes and differentiation. Our study demonstrated that CD2 expression levels are closely linked to the quality of immunological synapses formed by CAR-T cells and their antitumor potency. Exogenous CD2 supplementation enhances the ability of CAR-T cells to form high-quality synapses, reduces T-cell exhaustion, and increases sustained antitumor efficacy. Additionally, ectopic CD2 expression increases CAR-T-cell sensitivity to low-density antigens. Thus, replenishing CD2 in CAR-T cells is a promising strategy to increase the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) tumors present a major clinical challenge due to complex immune evasion mechanisms and generally poor responses to immunotherapy. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a critical determinant of immunotherapy resistance. Immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, together with aberrant cytokine networks and mechanical stress in the tumor stroma, cooperate to exclude T-cell infiltration and induce T-cell exhaustion, thereby undermining the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, TIME-driven signaling pathway activation and epigenetic reprogramming further reinforce immune escape and therapeutic failure. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have greatly improved our understanding of these processes. Meanwhile, strategies including multi-target combination immunotherapies, epigenetic modulators, mRNA vaccines, and gut microbiota interventions are under active investigation to reverse resistance and remodel the TIME. This mini review summarizes the multifaceted mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in GI tumors and discusses the potential of emerging therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes.">

This study analyzed the transcriptomic data of 525 patients from TCGA-GBM-HG_U133A. Two molecular subtypes were identified based on 182 CTLE-associated genes, with 238 differentially expressed genes between them. A prognostic model was developed, identifying BST2 and DIRAS3 as key risk factors, and validated in multiple cohorts. The subtypes had distinct immune profiles, with Cluster 2 showing higher immune infiltration but a poorer prognosis. The model had a good predictive performance. High-risk patients had upregulated BST2 and DIRAS3, linked to immunosuppression and shorter survival. Knockdown experiments confirmed their roles in GBM cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, they promote immune evasion. BST2 and DIRAS3 could be therapeutic targets for HGG immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Despite significant advances in cancer therapies, many malignancies remain resistant to current treatments due to complex immunosuppressive mechanisms, limited neoantigen expression, and dynamic tumor adaptations, underscoring the need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), particularly with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs and recombinant TCRs) targeting cancer-associated antigens, has emerged as a transformative strategy. However, conventional CAR-T cell therapies face substantial limitations such as manufacturing challenges, severe toxicities, and limited efficacy against solid tumors. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a unique lymphocyte subset bridging innate and adaptive immunity, have emerged as a compelling alternative platform for CAR-based therapies, due to their distinctive ability to persist, penetrate in and remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME). Unlike conventional T cells, iNKT cells exhibit rapid activation without priming, potent cytotoxicity, and extensive immunomodulatory functions. Furthermore, the inherent immunomodulatory properties of iNKT cells through interactions with the monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule CD1d or stress ligands augment endogenous anti-tumor immunity by activating NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and reducing immunosuppressive myeloid cells, unlike other Innate T cells. CAR-engineered iNKT (CAR-iNKT) cells therefore leverage multiple targeting mechanisms through their native semi-invariant T-cell receptor (TCR), NK receptors (NKRs) and engineered CARs, enabling broader and more effective tumor recognition while actively reshaping immunosuppressive TME. Notably, iNKT cells lack alloreactivity, circumventing the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), positioning CAR-iNKT cells as ideal candidates for “off-the-shelf” allogeneic therapies that can overcome the limitations of existing immunotherapies.">

Within the TME, immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells can drive both pro- and anti-tumor processes. This review integrates their classification, phenotypic plasticity, and roles in NSCLC, highlighting key preclinical and clinical evidence while discussing pathogenesis, prognostic significance, and therapeutic potential. We also summarize the current immunotherapeutic strategies for advanced NSCLC, including first- or second-line regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or combined with chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, or additional checkpoint inhibitors, and future directions.

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="Purpose The heterogeneity of immune cells is a critical manifestation of gastric cancer (GC) heterogeneity and significantly contributes to immune therapy resistance. Although previous studies have focused on the roles of specific myeloid cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells in immune resistance, the immune cell interaction network and its spatiotemporal distribution in GC immune resistance remain underexplored. Methods This study integrated multiple GC single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, bulk-RNA sequencing, and single-cell immunotherapy datasets of our cohort (NFHGC Cohort). Methods such as single-cell subpopulation identification, transcriptomic analysis, spatial colocalization, cell communication network analysis and tissue immunofluorescence of gastric cancer were employed to investigate immune cell interactions and their molecular mechanisms in immune resistance. Results By leveraging a comprehensive approach that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA-seq profiles, we identified 20 immune subsets with potential prognostic and therapeutic implications. Our findings suggest a stromal immunosuppressive network orchestrated by Macro_SPP1/C1QC macrophages and CD8_Tex_C1 T cells, which may form a barrier impeding antitumor immunity. Macrophage-derived MIF signaling appears to drive immunosuppression via the MIF-CD74/CXCR4/CD44 axis. Based on these observations, we developed a preliminary TME classification system using a gene signature derived from barrier-associated immune cell markers and unsupervised clustering. Conclusions Our study identified a potential stromal immunosuppressive barrier in gastric cancer, driven by Macro_SPP1/C1QC macrophages and CD8_Tex_C1 T cells, which may contribute to immune dysfunction and therapy resistance. Molecular subtyping based on this barrier’s presence could inform personalized immune therapy strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite causative links to lymphoproliferative disorders, little is known about early events governing KSHV infection in B lymphocytes. IL‐6 signaling plays a critical role in KSHV‐mediated disease, with human IL‐6 (hIL6) levels correlating with viral load and disease progression. This dynamic is even more complex due to the coexistence of hIL6 and KSHV‐encoded viral IL‐6 (vIL6) in these diseases. We hypothesize that hIL6 and vIL6 play critical, separable and collective roles in the early stages of KSHV infection in B cells. In this study, we use our ex vivo model of KSHV infection in human tonsil lymphocytes to investigate the relative contributions of vIL6 and hIL6 to early infection events in human B cells. We demonstrate that vIL6 and hIL6 collectively suppress KSHV infection in B cells restricting the distribution of KSHV within B cell subsets. We show that vIL6 manipulates hIL6 expression in a subset‐specific manner, and that vIL6 and hIL6 differentially influence the differentiation of germinal center and plasmablasts. Taken together, these results suggest a novel paradigm in which KSHV uses vIL6 to abrogate the GC‐mediated maturation pathway for antibody secreting cells that is driven by hIL6 signaling.">

Here, we describe that TH17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of TH17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between TH17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.">

Emerging evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting innate immunity via TAM repolarization, MDSC depletion, and NK cell activation to reshape the immunosuppressive TME.

        <tr id="Relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the leading cause of treatment failure in patients with hematologic malignancies. To better understand the mechanisms underlying early relapse (ER), we comprehensively explored the expression of inhibitory receptors (IRs) in bone marrow (BM) T cells at differentiation stage and examined transcriptional differences. Among the evaluated IRs, TIM3 was significantly upregulated in CD3+T cells of patients with ER compared to patients with complete remission (CR). Notably, double-negative T (DNT) cells, a unique subset with MHC-independent cytotoxic potential, constituted a high proportion of BM T cells and expressed increased TIM3 expression in ER patients. Moreover, regulatory T cells (Tregs) showed elevated TIM3 levels, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment after allo-HSCT. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of cytotoxic granules and effector genes in DNT cells from ER patients. Functional assays demonstrated that TIM3 blockade with sabatolimab restored T cell cytotoxicity, leading to enhanced leukemia cell apoptosis in ER patients. These findings highlight TIM3 as a critical regulator of T cell exhaustion and immune suppression in patients with ER and provide a rationale for the therapeutic use of TIM3 blockade in preventing and treating relapses after allo-HSCT.

        <tr id="The senescence of immune cells has also emerged as a key hallmark of immunological dysregulation and chronic inflammation in autoimmunity. Senescent immune cells are irreversibly arrested in the cell cycle, exhibit antimetabolic characteristics, and secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, all together disrupting immune homeostasis. T cells, B cells, and innate immune subsets, acquire a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which initiates tissue damage and sustains continuous inflammation in autoimmune diseases. The accumulation of senescent immune cells undermines immune surveillance, disrupts self-tolerance mechanisms, and enhances autoantibody production, all of which contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accumulating evidence reveals that metabolic stress, chronic DNA damage, and persistent antigenic exposure in inflammatory microenvironments induce immune cell senescence. Such senescent condition more aggressively promotes disease pathogenesis by compromising antigen presentation, disrupting cytokine signaling, and weakening the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Targets of senolytic drugs, SASP inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and CAR T cell therapy currently have the potential to accelerate autoimmune pathology. These treatments would be directed specifically against the selective elimination or reprogramming of senescent cells to restore immune homeostasis. This review examines the mechanistic relationships between autoimmune development and immune cell senescence, as well as recent advancements in senescence-directed therapy. Understanding these pathways can provide new insights into autoimmune pathogenesis and inform future therapeutic approaches to immune cell aging.">

The immunosuppressive AML microenvironment, characterized by profound immune dysfunction, critically impairs anti-leukemic immune surveillance. This immunologically hostile niche is principally governed by specialized immunosuppressive cell populations—notably regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs), and regulatory B cells (Bregs)—which collectively establish an immune-privileged sanctuary for leukemic cells. This review critically examines three fundamental aspects of these immunosuppressive regulators in AML pathogenesis: (1) their recruitment dynamics within the leukemic niche, (2) the molecular mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive functions, and (3) current and emerging therapeutic approaches designed to neutralize their inhibitory effects. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide a mechanistic framework for developing more effective immunotherapeutic interventions against AML.">

Beyond their well-established role in thrombopoiesis, MKs have been identified as important for BM niche maintenance, such as by supporting the growth and differentiation of other cell types. Recently, megakaryopoiesis has been reported as yielding divergent subpopulations of MKs, as evidenced by single-cell RNA sequencing of lung, spleen, or BM resident MKs. Interestingly, these subpopulations constitute a significant proportion of “immune MKs” expressing various classical immune markers and capable of phagocytosing pathogens and contributing to antigen presentation. As such, MKs were also found to regulate inflammation, mainly by secreting various cytokines and chemokines to crosstalk with other cell types. The level and functional signature of these “immune MKs” were found to be altered in various pathological conditions, indicative of their purposeful values in health and diseases. In this review, we survey and highlight newly reported functional immune and inflammatory properties of MKs in health and in select pathologies.">

These effects were observed following the treatment of splenic mononuclear cells with erythroblast-conditioned media received from both healthy mice and mice subjected to hematopoiesis-activating conditions (hypoxia, blood loss, and hemolytic anemia), suggesting a common mechanism of action. Using flow cytometry, we elucidated that erythroblast-derived soluble products modulate T cell differentiation by promoting Treg development and increasing PD-1 surface expression on B cells. The immunoregulatory potential of erythroblasts is subpopulation-dependent: CD45+ erythroblasts respond to hemolytic stress by upregulating the surface expression of immunosuppressive molecules PDL1 and Galectin-9, while CD45- erythroblasts primarily increase TGFb production. These findings highlight the regulatory role of erythroblasts in modulating immune responses.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) is commonly labeled a “cold tumor” due to its dense population of immunosuppressive cells, particularly M2-like macrophages, which contribute to its resistance to therapy. Thus, there is a pressing need to shift the macrophage polarization towards M1 and revitalize the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to improve BC prognosis. In this study, we leveraged published RNA-sequencing data and performed multiplex immunohistochemistry on clinical specimens to identify NR4A3 as a promising biomarker for favorable outcomes in BC. High NR4A3 expression correlates with an inflamed TIME, characterized by heightened T-cell infiltration and activation. NR4A3 was preferentially expressed in macrophages and fostered M1-like macrophage polarization through direct binding to p65, thereby enhancing NF-κB transcriptional activity. Overexpression of Nr4a3 in tumor-infiltrating macrophages significantly inhibited the growth of E0771 tumors in a syngeneic mouse model, accompanied by increased T-cell infiltration and elevated production of functional cytokines. Conversely, suppression of Nr4a3 in macrophages compromised T-cell recruitment and diminished their anti-tumor capabilities. Consistent with these findings, co-culture experiments involving human T cells and NR4A3-overexpressing THP1 cells further demonstrated enhanced T-cell functionality. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel role for NR4A3 in macrophage polarization and TIME remodeling, offering a potential biomarker for favorable BC prognosis and a therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing natural killer (NK) cells has demonstrated success against hematological malignancies. Efficacy against solid tumors has been limited by poor NK cell survival and function in the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To enhance efficacy against solid tumors, stimulatory cytokines have been incorporated into CAR-NK cell therapeutic approaches. However, current cytokine strategies have limitations, including systemic toxicities, exogenous dependencies, and unwanted TME bystander effects. Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by modifying CAR-NK cells to express a constitutively active interleukin (IL)-7 receptor, termed C7R, capable of providing intrinsic CAR-NK cell activation that does not rely on or produce exogenous signals nor activate bystander cells. Methods We examined persistence, antitumor function, and transcriptional profiles of CAR-NK cells coexpressing C7R in a novel tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) co-culture system and against hematologic and solid tumor xenografts in vivo. Results Peripheral blood NK cells expressing a CAR directed against the solid tumor antigen GD2 and modified with C7R demonstrated enhanced tumor killing and persistence in vitro compared with CAR-NK cells without cytokine support and similar functions to CAR-NK cells supplemented with recombinant IL-15. C7R.CAR-NK cells exhibited enhanced survival and proliferation within neuroblastoma TiME xenografts in vivo but produced poor long-term tumor control compared with CAR-NK cells supplemented with IL-15. Similar results were seen using C7R-expressing CD19.CAR-NK cells against CD19+leukemia xenografts. Gene expression analysis revealed that chronic signaling via C7R induced a transcriptional signature consistent with intratumor stressed NK cells with blunted effector function. We identified gene candidates associated with chronic cytokine-stressed NK cells that could be targeted to reduce CAR-NK cell stress within the solid TME. Conclusion C7R promoted CAR-NK cell survival in hostile TMEs independent of exogenous signals but resulted in poor antitumor function in vivo. Our data reveals the detrimental role of continuous IL-7 signaling in CAR-NK cells and provides insights into proper application of cytokine signals when attempting to enhance CAR-NK cell antitumor activity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The rapid deterioration and fatal outcomes in Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV)‐related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the key factors contributing to the progression of EBV‐HLH by comparing EBV cellular tropism and host immune responses between survivors and deceased patients. Compared to healthy individuals, acute HLH patients exhibited impaired natural killer (NK) cell activity, which improved during the recovery phase. However, deceased patients demonstrated heightened NK cell activity and increased EBV loads during the deterioration phase. Additionally, deceased patients had elevated EBV‐specific T cell responses without cytokine storm, suggesting other factors beyond host immunity contribute to HLH deterioration. Notably, in deceased cases, EBV infection spread to NK and NKT cells with a highly proliferative profile, whereas it was limited to B cells in survivors. Furthermore, EBV‐infected NK and NKT cells displayed a higher percentage of copy number variations and significant enrichment in canonical cancer pathways compared to noninfected cells, indicating their oncogenic potential and possible contribution to HLH deterioration. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of EBV‐HLH and may guide the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background: Aberrant CD8 T-cell differentiation contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and immune-mediated tissue damage. However, the molecular mechanisms that prevent premature effector T cell programming in humans remain incompletely defined. Signal regulatory protein gamma (SIRPγ) is selectively expressed on T-cells in the human immune system. Notably, genetic variants associated with reduced SIRPγ expression have been linked to increased risk of immune-mediated diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, but the contribution of SIRPγ to CD8 T-cell dysregulation in these contexts remains unclear. Objective: To determine how inter-individual variation in SIRPγ expression influences immune homeostasis and CD8 T-cell effector programming. Methods: Peripheral blood CD8 T-cells from healthy donors were analyzed for SIRPγ expression and associated differentiation phenotypes. Naïve CD8 T-cells were purified and subjected to siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRPG, followed by suboptimal TCR stimulation. Differentiation status, transcription factor expression, and effector cytokine production were measured using flow cytometry. CD47 blockade was used to assess ligand dependency. Results: Low SIRPγ expression on CD8 T-cells was associated with increased frequencies of CD27−CD45RO+ effector-like and CD27−CD45RO− terminally differentiated CD8 T-cells. SIRPG knockdown induced effector-like differentiation, with increased CD45RO and T-bet expression and elevated TNF-α, IFN-γ, and Granzyme B production. This effect was not recapitulated by CD47 blockade, suggesting a CD47-independent regulatory mechanism. Conclusion: SIRPγ serves as a negative regulator of CD8 T-cell effector differentiation under suboptimal stimulation. Inter-individual variation in its expression may influence susceptibility to immune dysregulation, positioning it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.">

It is characterized by the communication between tumor cells and both innate and adaptive immune cells. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are temporary abnormal collections of lymphoid tissues in which specialized immune responses against tumors can occur. B cells are crucial for the prognostic prediction of various cancers, particularly in response to immunotherapy. There are many types of B cells within the TME, including naive, terminally differentiated plasma, and memory B cells. Our focus was to understand the various types of B cells and how radiation therapy influences B cells in TLS. In this review, we discuss the notion that radiotherapy may alter the creation and function of B cells in TLS, which could result in a powerful and advanced form of cancer immunity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Human polymorphonuclear-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) consist of circulating low-density neutrophils (LDNs) characterized by the ability to inhibit T-cell responses. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the mature fraction of PMN-MDSCs (i.e. mPMN-MDSCs) exerts more potent immunosuppressive functions than its immature counterpart. More recently, we defined a specific gene signature of mPMN-MDSCs from cancer patients and G-CSF-treated donors (GDs) by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments. In this study, by performing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments of circulating mPMN-MDSCs from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we identified a major scRNA-seq cell cluster (arbitrarily named NSCLC c6) specifically displaying immunosuppressive and protumor transcriptomic features. Then, by analyzing publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from human tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), we uncovered three TAN clusters (arbitrarily named TAN c6-c8) that were found to share with NSCLC c6 several common genes and transcription factor (TF) regulons associated with response to hypoxia, positive regulation of angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, by performing scRNA-seq experiments of GD mPMN-MDSCs, we uncovered four scRNA-seq cell clusters (arbitrarily named GD c4-c7) that were enriched for the same genes and pathways characterizing NSCLC c6 and TAN c6-c8 cells. Altogether, these data uncover that human circulating mPMN-MDSCs and TANs from different cancer types share scRNA-seq cell clusters with transcriptomic similarities, supporting the notion that they might be strictly related.">

Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a substantial and previously unrecognized depletion of bone marrow B cells at all stages of development in antibiotic-treated mice, further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Depletion of the microbiota was associated with rapid changes in the peripheral B cell compartment, yet fecal microbiota transfer did not rescue both peripheral and bone marrow B cells to a greater degree than natural recovery from antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic-mediated loss of B cell progenitors was secondary to enhanced apoptosis and occurred independent of disrupted systemic type I and II interferon signaling, previously implicated in the maintenance of other hematopoietic compartments. Instead, the depletion of pro-survival MYC signaling was implicated in the depletion of circulating lymphocytes and bone marrow B cell progenitor populations during antibiotic treatment. Further, in vitro exposure of bone marrow cells to antibiotics demonstrated significantly decreased viability of B cells. We conclude that both microbiota depletion and cytotoxic effects of prolonged broad spectrum antibiotic treatment disrupt cytokine and cell survival signaling critical for B cell progenitor maintenance. These results contribute to our understanding of the compartment-specific mechanisms by which the microbiota maintains the hematopoietic system and suggest critical pathways for maintenance of bone marrow progenitors during prolonged antibiotic treatment.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of immune cells that play a central role in regulating host immune responses during fungal infections. Their recruitment is mediated by pathogen recognition receptors, particularly Dectin-1 and CARD9 signaling, which promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β. Once activated, MDSCs suppress T-cell and natural killer cell functions through immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as enzymes such as arginase-1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1). This review explores the role of MDSCs in fungal infections caused by Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Aspergillus spp., and Cryptococcus neoformans, emphasizing their impact on immune modulation and disease progression. The emerging evidence suggests that fungal bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharides, can influence MDSC activity and restore immune balance. Notably, therapies targeting MDSCs have demonstrated promise in both fungal infections. In particular, infections with P. brasiliensis and C. neoformans show improved T-cell responses following MDSC-targeted interventions. Additionally, polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa and exposure to Aspergillus sydowii affect MDSC behavior, supporting the potential of modulating these cells therapeutically. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of MDSCs in fungal pathogenesis and underscore their potential as targets for immunotherapeutic strategies in infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The hyporesponsiveness of tumor-infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells to tumor cells contributes to immune escape of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), representing a major challenge in current immunotherapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Methods We first examined myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) expression in RCC cell lines and clinical specimens, and analyzed its correlation with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion markers. To investigate the immunoregulatory role of MIAT, we evaluated its effects on CD8+ T-cell function using T-cell co-culture systems and humanized-peripheral blood mononuclear cells RCC patient-derived xenograft models. To determine the direct effects of MIAT on tumor cells, we assessed RCC cell malignant phenotypes following MIAT knockdown both in vitro and in immunodeficient nude mouse orthotopic xenograft models. Mechanistically, we employed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromatin isolation by RNA purification followed by mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to identify the molecular interactions between MIAT, transcription factors, and target genes. Results MIAT was highly expressed in RCC cells and positively correlated with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion status. MIAT knockdown significantly enhanced CD8+ T-cell function with increased perforin and interferon-γ production, while reducing the expression of exhaustion markers programmed cell death protein 1 and T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains. Mechanistically, MIAT was predominantly localized in the nucleus and formed a trimeric complex with transcription factor ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) and janus kinase 3 (JAK3) promoter, thereby upregulating JAK3 expression and activating the JAK3/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Importantly, ectopic expression of JAK3 largely abolished both the tumor-suppressive effects and enhanced T-cell function induced by MIAT depletion. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the MIAT/JAK3/STAT3 pathway plays a critical role in malignant progression and immune escape of RCC through regulating CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for RCC immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with an overall poor prognosis due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with pro-tumorigenic properties are dominant populations of immune cells in the glioblastoma TME. To date, several studies targeting TAMs to fight tumor progression in different tumor entities have been initiated. However, the impact of standard therapy schemes of glioblastoma cells on macrophage polarization, activation, and phagocytosis remains controversial. The same applies to the relevance of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in the interaction between macrophages and tumor cells. Our study, therefore, investigated patient-oriented treatment of GLIOBLASTOMA by examining the phagocytic capacity of polarized M1- and M2-like macrophages using GL261-luc2 tumor cells as a preclinical model system. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of activation and immune checkpoint markers on these macrophage subtypes following contact with tumor cells and their microenvironment. These factors were also determined after PD-1 blockade was initiated. The analyses revealed that the immunoregulatory M2-like macrophages generally exhibited a higher phagocytosis rate than the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages; however, this was not influenced by the pretreatment of glioblastoma cells with chemo- or radiotherapy. This could not be improved by blocking the PD-1 receptor. Furthermore, there were no modulations in the expression of differentiation, activation, or immune checkpoint molecules of M1- and M2-like macrophages after cell-to-cell contact with glioblastoma cells. But the medium conditioned by tumor cells strongly altered M1-like macrophages toward a more activated state, whereas M2-like cells were only mildly influenced. This was further enhanced by tumor cell treatment, with the most prominent effect after irradiation. These results suggest that conventional GLIOBLASTOMA tumor cell treatment affects the immunogenic status of macrophage subtypes, which is relevant for enhancing the anti-tumor immune response in brain tumors.">

        <tr id="Background Aging is linked to various dysfunctions of the immune system, including the decline of its primary developmental source: the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). Results An analysis of the conditioned media from young and aged HSC niches revealed that the environment of aged niches exhibited an increased presence of adiponectin. This media was subsequently utilized in BMDC differentiation and maturation protocols, with their effects closely monitored. Our results indicate that the old HSC niche microenvironment promotes premature BMDC activation, characterized by elevated MHC class II expression and enhanced allostimulatory capacity of BMDCs at their immature stage. Additionally, LPS stimulation of BMDCs, used to induce DC maturation, significantly increased CD86 expression on BMDCs from the aged niche. However, these cells did not show superior allostimulatory capacity compared to their counterparts from the young niche environment. By analyzing the BMDC cytokine profile, we observed that when cultured in aged niche-conditioned media, the BMDCs secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, indicating a heightened proinflammatory activation state. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that aging-related changes within the HSC niche can considerably alter DC functionality by disrupting their normal development from BM precursors. These results emphasize the significance of this phenomenon and its implications for immunosenescence.

        <tr id="Understanding the roles of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising strategy to identify novel targets to counteract the immunosuppressive barriers protecting multiple myeloma (MM). Neutrophils are a new cancer research focus due to their potential to reduce the efficacy of immune-based therapies. This study aimed to deepen understanding of neutrophil function in MM by analyzing freshly isolated myeloid cells from paired focal lesions (FL) and bone marrow (BM) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunofluorescence imaging, and functional assays. We describe three distinct CXCR2+ mature neutrophil subsets: TREM1+CD10+, RETN+LCN2+, and TNFAIP3+CXCL8+, each exhibiting unique phenotypes within the TME. Notably, the TREM1+CD10+ subset was highly prevalent, particularly in FL, demonstrating potent immunosuppressive effects on T cells. This subset's gene signature was correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) in a large MM patient dataset, underscoring its clinical significance. Targeted inhibition of neutrophil activity through CXCR2 blockade, alone or combined with standard anti-MM therapies, significantly reduced tumor burden, improving OS in preclinical MM models. These insights into neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression in MM provide valuable knowledge regarding mechanisms driving immune evasion and reveal new therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of MM treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Oncolytic virus (OV)-mediated immunotherapy has been shown limited efficacy. Small molecule inhibitors specific to the KRASG12C driver oncoprotein have recently been developed for cancer treatment. The combination of a potent OV with a KRASG12C inhibitor could be a potent combination strategy for treating KRASG12C cancer. Methods We explored combination therapies using KRASG12C inhibitor and OV in cancer cells in vitro and in two KRASG12C cancer models. We employed flow cytometry to evaluate the immune cell profiles, including dendritic cells, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, natural killer (NK), subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3), activation markers (granzyme B, IFN-γ and 4-1BB) as well as enzyme-linked immunospot assay to identify tumor-antigen specific T cells. The importance of CD4+, CD8+ T and NK cells in the therapeutic effects was evaluated by antibody-mediated depletion in vivo. Results We confirmed that three inhibitors for KRASG12C, AMG510 (sotorasib), MRTX849 (adagrasib) and MRTX1257, all displayed potent cytotoxicity to cancer cells harboring KRASG12C, but not to cancer cells without this specific KRAS mutation in vitro. All three inhibitors exhibited potent antitumor activity in KRASG12C Lewis lung cancer, but not in MC38 colon cancer with wild-type KRAS. In two KRASG12C tumor models, either an IL-36γ-armed OV or orally delivered MRTX1257 inhibited tumor growth, but the combination worked much more efficiently, and efficacy was further improved with PD-1 blockade although with no statistical difference in survival, leading to complete tumor remission in a large fraction of the mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that MRTX1257, and other KRASG12C inhibitors as well, are potent inducers of antitumor immunity by themselves, and that it worked with OV to elicit potent innate and adaptive tumor-specific immunity. The combination therapeutic efficacy depended largely on increased tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and to a smaller degree, on CD4+ T and NK cells. Conclusions Small molecule inhibitors of KRASG12C are novel inducers of tumor-specific immunity, and a unique triple combination regimen is highly efficacious through elicited potent antitumor immunity for KRASG12C cancers.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review examines how myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) might contribute to an age-related increase in cancer incidence, traditionally attributed to the accumulation of somatic DNA mutations in stem cells. We discuss the emerging and potentially complementary perspective of a progressive decline in immune system fitness with age, which reduces its ability to detect and eliminate neoplastic cells. In particular, the review discusses the evidence implicating MDSCs in the suppression of immune function and their contribution to immunosenescence. Although several aspects of MDSC activity still remain unclear and more in-depth investigation is needed, advancing this area of research may lead to novel strategies for improving cancer treatment outcomes in elderly patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Emerging clinical and mouse tumor data indicate that tumor cells induce immune suppression in an anatomical site-specific manner. In lung metastases, tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) engages myeloid cell programmed cell death protein 1 to activate SHP2 to suppress type I interferon (IFN-I) expression to repress Cxcl9 expression to impair cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) tumor recruitment. Loss of IFN-I expression thus underlies tumor immune evasion in lung metastases niche. We aimed at testing the hypothesis that forcing tumor cells to express IFNα2 activates Cxcl9 expression to increase CTL tumor recruitment to suppress lung metastasis. Methods Codon usage-optimized IFNα2-encoding DNA was designed and cloned to plasmid. IFNα2-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) was synthesized. The plasmid DNA and mRNA were encapsulated into DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate)-cholesterol to generate lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mouse IFNα2 (LNP-mIFNα2), human IFNα2 plasmid, and mouse IFNα2 mRNA (LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA). Mouse breast tumor spontaneous lung metastasis, mouse melanoma experimental lung metastasis, and human colon tumor experimental lung metastasis humanized mouse models were used to determine LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid and mRNA efficacy in IFNα2 expression and antitumor immunity, toxicity, and mechanism of action in vivo. Results LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid primarily accumulated in tumor-bearing lungs in mice. LNP-IFNα2 therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein in mouse tumor-bearing mice and human IFNα2 protein in human tumor-bearing humanized mice to suppress lung metastasis, respectively. Similarly, LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein and suppressed lung metastasis in tumor-bearing mice. The increased IFNα2 protein activates Cxcl9 expression and increases T cell infiltration in lung metastases. LNP-IFNα2 therapy did not induce liver toxicity and inflammatory cytokines. In human patients with cancer, IFN-I pathway activation is correlated with CXCL9 expression and T cell expansion after PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Mechanistically, LNP-delivered IFNα2 suppresses tumor lung metastasis through upregulating Cxcl9 in tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Our findings determine that LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid DNA and mRNA are effective agents in restoring IFNα2 expression to activate Cxcl9 expression to enhance T cell tumor recruitment to suppress tumor lung metastasis. LNP-IFNα2 is potentially a safe and yet effective third-generation IFNα2 agent for human cancer immunotherapy to treat patients with lung metastasis.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Patients with chronic blood cancers called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) can benefit from a therapy based on interferon alpha, which helps the immune system fight disease. However, we still do not fully understand how this treatment works at the molecular level, or how to predict who will respond best. In this study, we analyzed blood samples from patients treated with interferon alpha to investigate changes in immune signals and gene activity over time. We found a progressive decrease in inflammation-related molecules and changes in genes involved in immune regulation, cell survival, and blood cell production. These results suggest that interferon gradually reshapes the immune system and may help control the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting cell death in abnormal blood cells. Our findings may help identify new biomarkers to personalize treatment and monitor its effectiveness in future patients.">

        <tr id="The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma limits the effectiveness of most immunotherapies. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling drives tumor progression and prevents effective T cell activity. Notably, both regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells within glioblastoma and other tumors express high levels of the immune checkpoint receptor, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), which modulates T cell activation and function. Combining GITR agonism with TGF-β inhibition may therefore offer a compelling approach to restore anti-tumor immunity. We evaluated the combined effects of TGF-β inhibition and GITR modulation using two different GITR agonists in syngeneic mouse glioma models. GITR modulation enhanced T cell activation, as shown by increased cytokine secretion and effector T cell proliferation in vitro. Combining GITR modulation with TGF-β inhibition amplified these effects, resulting in significantly stronger immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing compared to single-agent treatments. Combination therapy improved survival of glioma-bearing mice, with a higher fraction of long-term survivors compared to monotherapy. Surviving mice resisted tumor re-challenge, indicating durable adaptive immunity. In summary, dual targeting of TGF-β and GITR pathways synergistically enhances anti-tumor immunity in glioblastoma. This novel combination strategy demonstrates clinical potential by addressing the limitations of existing immunotherapies and offering a promising approach for durable and effective glioblastoma treatment.

Additionally, real-time PCR was used to evaluate the downstream regulatory gene FOXD3 expression and the immune regulator PVRL2. VISTA was overexpressed on blasts in B-ALL patients. Also, the frequency of CD3+CD8+VISTA+ T cytotoxic cells was significantly higher in patients compared to controls, while CD3+CD4+VISTA+ T helper cells were reduced. CD19+VISTA+ cells were more abundant in the complete remission group compared to the non-complete remission group. FOXD3, a key regulator of VISTA, was significantly downregulated in B-ALL, consistent with VISTA overexpression. The CD244/CD48 interaction, which can promote anti-tumoral immune responses, showed a reduction in CD3+CD4+CD48+ and CD19+CD48+ cells, while CD3+CD8+CD48+ cells were increased. VISTA overexpression and FOXD3 downregulation in B-ALL, alongside altered CD48, and PVRL2 expression, highlight mechanisms of immune evasion. These findings position VISTA as a promising biomarker and target for B-ALL immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that is often resistant to conventional therapies. The present narrative review discusses on the role of T cell metabolic reprogramming in the AML tumor microenvironment (TME), which markedly impacts the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The TME of AML, influenced by factors such as high lactic acid (LA) levels, hypoxia and nutrient competition, hampers T cell functions such as glycolysis, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, leading to impaired T cell proliferation and antitumor response. Metabolic waste products, including LA and adenosine, further contribute to the immunosuppressive environment. T cell exhaustion, induced by nutrient deprivation and metabolic dysregulation, serves a key role in the failure of immune responses. Moreover, strategies to modulate T cell metabolism, such as targeting glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, show promise in enhancing immunotherapy outcomes. The current review also highlights emerging technologies, such as single-cell metabolomics and CRISPR screening, which are critical for identifying metabolic targets and advancing personalized therapies. Despite challenges in translating these findings to clinical settings, understanding T cell metabolism in the AML TME offers new therapeutic avenues for improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection, characterized by an initial hyperinflammatory phase frequently followed by compensatory immunosuppression (CARS). Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical, biphasic role: inadequate suppression during early hyperinflammation fails to control cytokine storms, while excessive/persistent activity in late-phase immunosuppression drives immune paralysis and secondary infection susceptibility. This review explores advances in targeting Treg immunoregulation across bacterial, viral, and fungal sepsis, where pathogenic type critically influenced the types of immunoresponses, shaping Treg heterogeneity in terms of phenotype, survival, and function. Understanding this multifaceted Treg biology offers novel therapeutic avenues, highlighting the need to decipher functional heterogeneity and develop precisely timed, pathogen-tailored immunomodulation to safely harness beneficial Treg roles while mitigating detrimental immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a high-mortality cancer due to its aggressive nature and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which enables evasion of immune surveillance. Despite chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival is ~ 30%, necessitating novel immunotherapies. AML suppresses cytotoxic T/NK cells by co-opting regulatory pathways, creating an “immune paradox.” Emerging strategies aim to disrupt this evasion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CD47 magrolimab, combined with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), enhance T-cell activity and phagocytosis, especially in TP53-mutated AML. Therapeutic vaccines targeting leukemia-associated antigens (e.g., WT1, PRAME) via dendritic cell fusion show early success in prolonging remission. Combinatorial approaches, like HMAs with STING agonists or dual checkpoint blockade, target multiple immunosuppressive pathways to overcome resistance. Challenges include TME heterogeneity, therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells, toxicities (e.g., anemia, cytokine release syndrome), relapse from clonal evolution, and a lack of predictive biomarkers. Autologous therapies face economic and logistical hurdles, driving demand for scalable solutions. Advances in single-cell genomics, AI, and synthetic biology are identifying novel targets (TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA) and improving patient stratification. Integrating these innovations may transform AML into a chronic condition, bridging preclinical potential to clinical impact. In this review, we aim to evaluate mechanisms, challenges, and future directions of immunotherapies in AML with highlighting ICIs and vaccination to improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are a heterogenous population of cells that adopt specific phenotypes in response to signals from their dynamic microenvironment. Apart from being key players in innate immunity and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, macrophages are also important drivers of low-grade inflammation, which is associated with different chronic conditions including stress and cancer. The activation of macrophages during chronic stress and cancer results in their multifaceted pathogenic roles. Macrophages residing in the tumor microenvironment are commonly known as tumor-associated macrophages and favor or inhibit tumor growth depending on the microenvironmental cues and their activation state. Activated macrophages display a continuum of properties rather than a distinct proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory dichotomy. Emerging evidence suggests that prolonged tissue residency restricts the plasticity of macrophages, while recruited monocytes are more plastic and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages during stress can result in a dual imprinting from both the existing stress-induced inflammation and the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment and reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages toward the anti-tumor phenotypes have emerged as promising therapeutic approaches. In this review, we will focus on how the persistent inflammatory state underlying chronic stress affects macrophages as well as the macrophages’ contribution to various aspects of tumor growth and progression, highlighting a therapeutic potential of modulation of the macrophage-mediated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.">

A key mediator of immune evasion in ovarian cancer is the infiltration and activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress antitumor immunity and foster therapeutic resistance. Emerging therapeutic strategies to target Tregs—such as cytokine modulation, checkpoint blockade, metabolic inhibitors, and epigenetic regulators—are critically evaluated for their potential to restore antitumor immunity. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding how the ovarian TME shapes Treg biology, highlighting mechanisms such as cytokine signaling, chemokine-driven recruitment, metabolic reprogramming, and immune checkpoint interactions, as well as the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, including tissue-resident and follicular subsets, and their clonal expansion in response to tumor antigens. By elucidating the dynamic crosstalk between Tregs and the ovarian TME, this review provides a framework for developing novel immunotherapies to overcome Treg-mediated immunosuppression and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="The liver presents a unique immune system. Liver diseases are closely associated with the immune system. Disruption of the tightly regulated balance between immune activation and tolerance induction leads to the development and worsening of immune-related liver diseases. T cells play diverse crucial roles in the immune system, and they have long been known to induce inflammation through direct tissue damage by effector molecules and the recruitment of effector cells via chemokines. Additionally, T cells interact with B cells to induce autoantibodies, promoting tissue inflammation and dysfunction through the deposition of IgG and immune complexes in the tissues. Recent advances in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have elucidated the role of T cells in the progression and recovery of liver fibrosis. Moreover, comprehensive and unbiased information can now be obtained from small samples of human and mouse tissues, which advances our understanding of tissue-specific functions of T cells, including resident memory T cells, peripheral helper T cells, and tissue Tregs. However, significant unmet needs remain in the fields of immune-related liver diseases. In this review, we discuss the T cell biology and its role in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which are non-viral liver diseases exhibiting a strong involvement of immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, the latest therapeutic concepts for the diseases and associated drugs targeting T cells have been overviewed.">

Some studies revealed PD-1/CD95 co-expression is a marker of T cell dysfunction, while CTLA-4 upregulation correlates with suppressed early T cell activation. IL-10 has emerged as a potential biomarker for chemoresistance and tumor aggressivity, consistent with its role in promoting anti-apoptotic signaling in cancer stem cells (CSCs).

Although conventional therapies, such as surgery and radioactive iodine (RAI), are effective for differentiated thyroid cancers, treatment resistance and poor prognosis remain major challenges in advanced and undifferentiated forms. In current times, growing attention has been directed toward the potential of Natural Killer (NK) cells as a promising immunotherapeutic avenue. These innate immune cells are capable of direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells, but their efficiency is frequently compromised by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which inhibits NK cell activation, infiltration, and persistence.

We further discuss latest advancements in NK cell-based immunotherapies, including strategies for ex vivo expansion, genetic modification, and combinatorial approaches with checkpoint inhibitors or cytokines. Additionally, emerging modalities, such as NK cell-derived extracellular vesicles, are addressed. By combining mechanistic insights with advancing therapeutic techniques, this review provides a comprehensive perspective on NK cell-based interventions and their future potential in improving outcomes for patients with thyroid cancer.">

        <tr id="CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in treating hematologic malignancies; however, its efficacy in solid tumors remains constrained. In this study, we demonstrate that Lentinan (LTN), an active polysaccharide derived from Lentinula edodes, potently enhances CAR-T cell function against solid tumors. In vitro, LTN significantly augments CAR-T cell cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-2, IFN-γ). Mechanistically, LTN drives CAR-T cell differentiation into a memory phenotype, characterized by increased frequencies of CD44+CD62L+ central memory cells and enrichment of CD44+CD62L+TCF1+ stem-like memory cells, while concomitantly mitigating exhaustion, as evidenced by reduced surface expression of the checkpoint receptor TIM-3 and the exhaustion-associated marker CD317. These phenotypic and functional improvements correlate with LTN-mediated transcriptional upregulation of memory-associated factors Tcf7 (encoding TCF1) and Foxo1. In vivo, the combination of LTN and CAR-T significantly enhances tumor control in syngeneic murine models of colon carcinoma and melanoma. This superior efficacy stems from enhanced CAR-T cell persistence, sustained intratumoral effector function, and reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an immunostimulatory M1-like phenotype. This work establishes LTN as a clinically actionable immunomodulator that synergizes with CAR-T cells by intrinsically enhancing their fitness and persistence while extrinsically remodeling the suppressive tumor microenvironment. It provides a novel, translatable strategy to potentiate CAR-T therapy against solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is one of the hallmarks of cancers, including glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain tumors. Multiple mechanisms are employed by tumor cells and its microenvironment to evade immune detection and foster tumor growth and progression. The secretion of immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), the expression of checkpoint proteins such programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the recruitment of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to suppressed immune cell activity, favoring unchecked tumor growth. The FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) has shown context/tissue-dependent effects in cancers of different tissue origins, with either oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. Our laboratory has reported FAT1 to have an oncogenic function in glioblastoma. In addition, FAT1 promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma, reducing T-cell and monocyte infiltration while increasing immunosuppressive cells such as MDSCs. It also upregulates pro-inflammatory mediators [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], fostering tumor-promoting signaling. This dual role in immune evasion and pro-tumorigenic inflammatory processes makes FAT1 a key driver of glioblastoma progression. This highlights the potential of FAT1 as a compelling therapeutic target. This article provides a concise overview of immune tolerance mechanisms in glioblastoma, and the crucial role of FAT1 in promoting immune tolerance and tumor advancement. In addition, this review highlights currently available immunotherapies in clinical use or undergoing trials, and the potential of FAT1 as a promising target for combinatorial therapeutic interventions.

As key regulators of innate and adaptive immunity, they originate from either embryonic progenitors or bone marrow‐derived monocytes and exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues. Tissue‐resident macrophages (e.g., Langerhans cells, Kupffer cells, microglia) display unique organ‐specific functions, while inflammatory stimuli drive their polarization into proinflammatory (M1) or anti‐inflammatory (M2) phenotypes along a functional continuum. This review systematically examines macrophage subtypes, their anatomical distribution, and the signaling pathways (e.g., NF‐κB, STATs, PPARγ) underlying polarization shifts in acute and chronic inflammation. We highlight how polarization imbalances contribute to pathologies including neuroinflammation, liver fibrosis, and impaired tissue repair, particularly in aging contexts. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage plasticity, such as cytokine modulation, metabolic reprogramming, and subtype‐specific interventions. By integrating recent advances in macrophage biology, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding their dual roles in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, offering insights for treating inflammatory and age‐related diseases through macrophage‐centered immunomodulation.">

        <tr id="Background Indirect acute respiratory distress syndrome (iARDS) is a life-threatening inflammatory lung injury often triggered by extrapulmonary insults. Although immune checkpoints are critical regulators of inflammation, the role of V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) in iARDS remains unexplored. Methods Using a murine model of iARDS, we compared outcomes in VISTA knockout (VISTA−/−) and wild-type mice. Disease severity was assessed through lung injury scoring, survival analysis, and cytokine/chemokine profiling in plasma, lung tissue, and peritoneal fluid. The therapeutic potential of VISTA was evaluated using an anti-VISTA antibody (13F3). Results VISTA−/− mice exhibited exacerbated lung injury, reduced survival, and elevated systemic levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, MIP-2, and KC compared to wild-type controls. While cytokine levels in lung tissue remained stable, peritoneal fluid mediators were dysregulated in VISTA−/− mice, highlighting compartment-specific inflammatory regulation. Treatment with 13F3 reduced VISTA expression on myeloid and structural cells (monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, epithelium, endothelium) and partially modulated cytokine/chemokine profiles across compartments. Conclusion Our findings establish VISTA as a protective immune checkpoint in iARDS that restrains systemic hyperinflammation and organ damage. Although antibody-mediated VISTA targeting altered inflammatory pathways, its incomplete efficacy suggests complex, multifactorial mechanisms at play. These results position VISTA as a novel therapeutic target for iARDS and warrant further exploration of timed immunomodulatory strategies to harness its protective effects.">

        <tr id="Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a biologically and clinically unique malignancy characterized by rare Hodgkin and Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells surrounded by a dense and diverse inflammatory infiltrate. These malignant cells actively reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME) through metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion strategies. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how metabolic alterations contribute to tumor survival, immune dysfunction, and therapeutic resistance in cHL. We discuss novel therapeutic approaches aimed at disrupting these processes and examine the potential of combining metabolic interventions with immune-based strategies—such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), epigenetic modulators, bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T/CAR-NK cell therapies—which may help overcome resistance and enhance anti-tumor responses. Several agents are currently under investigation for their ability to modulate immune cell metabolism and restore effective immune surveillance. Altogether, targeting metabolic vulnerabilities within both tumor and immune compartments offers a promising, multifaceted strategy to improve clinical outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical global health concern, particularly in regions with high endemicity of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for advanced HCC. Despite encouraging results, primary and acquired resistance to ICIs continues to pose significant challenges in clinical practice. Recent research has identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as key contributors to immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, primarily through polarization to the M2 phenotype. M2-polarized TAMs secrete a range of immunosuppressive cytokines that inhibit T cell activation and promote tumor progression through processes such as angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These mechanisms compromise the efficacy of ICIs and facilitate tumor expansion and metastasis. This review summarizes the role of TAM-related signaling pathways in driving immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, with particular emphasis on the contribution of TAM surface receptors and chemokines in immune suppression. Additionally, the review highlights emerging insights into TAM metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation, which have been closely linked to ICI resistance. Furthermore, we explore promising therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs and their associated signaling pathways to enhance ICI efficacy in HCC. Integrating these novel approaches could potentially overcome TAM-driven immune evasion and ICI resistance, boosting the efficacy of immunotherapy and improving patient prognosis in HCC.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

However, the stability and function of such reprogrammed Tregs under inflammatory conditions remain unclear. Here, we show that demethylation of core Treg identity genes in Teff cells yields lineage-stable Effector T cell Reprogrammed Tregs (ER-Tregs). A single adoptive transfer of ER-Tregs not only prevents autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice when given before disease onset but also arrests its progression when administered after onset. Compared to Foxp3-overexpressing Teff cells, induced Tregs from naïve precursors, and endogenous Tregs, ER-Tregs provide superior protection against autoimmune neuroinflammation. This enhanced efficacy stems from their inherited autoantigen specificity and selectively preserved effector-cell transcriptional programs, which together bolster their fitness in inflammatory environments and enhance their suppressive capacity. Our results establish epigenetic reprogramming of autoreactive Teff cells as an effective approach to generate potent, stable Tregs for the treatment of refractory autoimmune conditions.">

With the emergence of novel immunotherapies, such as CAR-T, therapeutic outcomes in ML patients have improved, while significant challenges persist, including severe adverse events and disease recurrence. Natural killer cells (NK cells) are “natural killers” of the immune system that do not require antigen presentation and responsible for recognizing and destroying tumor cells. Some NK cells-based clinical experiments have been carried out and achieved remarkable results with lower side effects in ML. Crucially, within the ML microenvironment, NK cells frequently exhibit more severe functional exhaustion compared with T cells, characterized by impaired cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and proliferative capacity which limits anti-ML efficacy of NK cells. However, clinical studies utilizing NK cell-based therapies (e.g., adoptive transfer, CAR-NK cells) have demonstrated promising results with favorable safety profiles, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Therefore, developing more strategies based on NK cell is of great clinical significance for the treatment of ML. In this review, we systematically analysed the relationship between ML and NK cells, aiming to propose more novel protocols for NK cell expansion and persistence enhancement, establish evidence-based guidelines for next-generation NK cell-based immunotherapies in ML treatment.">

We aim to highlight how different components in this environment, including fibroblasts, suppressive immune cells, and genetic changes like TP53 mutations, contribute to disease progression. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can develop more effective therapies that target not just the cancer cells, but also the supportive environment around them.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

On the other hand, these cells exhibit a dualistic nature in cancer, which includes both pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects, highlighting the importance of the complex regulatory environment of their functioning and activation. The functions and evolution of ILTC are greatly influenced by microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules that mediate post-transcriptional regulation.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is driven by abnormal type-I and -II interferon activation, affecting a variety of immunocompetent cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modulate inflammation but often lack consistent potency. We developed HXB-319, an MSC-based therapy targeting inflammatory pathways in SLE. Previously, HXB-319 was shown to reduce alveolar hemorrhage in an SLE model. Here, we report its effects in a model of SLE that progresses to end stage kidney disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
SLE-like disease was induced via intraperitoneal (IP) pristane injection in female BALB/cJ mice, followed by treatment with naïve MSCs or HXB-319. Over 9 months, survival and proteinuria were monitored. Upon euthanasia, kidneys were analyzed for histopathology and gene expression, splenocytes for immune subsets by flow cytometry, and serum for autoantibodies, growth factors and cytokines.


RESULTS
HXB-319 significantly altered plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4+PD-L1+ cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ RORγt+ (Th17 cells) subsets. HXB-310 lowered IFN-γ (p< 0.001), IL-17A (p=0.01), BAFF (p<0.05), and anti-dsDNA (p<0.05), compared to untreated mice. HXB-319, but not naïve MSCs, significantly improved survival, halted progression of kidney disease and stabilized proteinuria (all p < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
HXB-319 demonstrates potential for mitigating SLE associated glomerulonephritis, improving survival and reducing proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive cancer with an increasing incidence worldwide, highlighting the need for research into its pathogenesis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in melanoma progression and consists of cellular components and an extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in cytokines and signaling molecules. The most abundant stromal cells within the TME are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which remodel the ECM and modulate immune responses. Among immune cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) predominate, and their polarization toward the M2 phenotype supports tumor progression. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have diverse functions, including cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells that modulate immune response, B-cells forming tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and regulatory T-cells with immunosuppressive properties. Dendritic cells (DCs) also play a complex role in the TME. A notable subpopulation are mature regulatory dendritic cells (mregDCs), which contribute to immune evasion. All of these TME components may drive tumorigenesis. Advancements in melanoma treatment—including immunotherapy and targeted therapies—have significantly improved outcomes in advanced-stage disease. In parallel, emerging approaches targeting the tumor microenvironment and gut microbiome, as well as personalized strategies such as neoantigen vaccines and cell-based therapies, are under active investigation and may further enhance therapeutic efficacy in the near future.">

To address these challenges, we engineered T-cell-derived sEVs with antitransferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) antibodies (T-EVs). This modification enhanced the delivery of sEV to six types of cancer cells, as confirmed by flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, live cell imaging, and blocking experiments in vitro. The T-EVs also reduced PD-L1 and Rab27a levels, decreased sEV production from breast cancer cells, and increased susceptibility to CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Systemically administered T-EVs efficiently targeted breast, lung, and skin tumors in mouse models. Notably, T-EVs significantly inhibited tumor growth without systemic toxicity. Additionally, T-EVs reduced PD-L1 and Rab27a levels in cancer cells while enhancing the CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity and proliferation. Overall, this study highlights the anticancer effects of T-EVs against multiple cancer types, underscoring their potential in developing targeted cancer therapies.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a self-defense mechanism that controls the homeostasis of an organism, and its alteration by persistent noxious stimuli could lead to an imbalance in the regulation of inflammatory responses mediated by innate and adaptive immunity. During chronic inflammation, sustained exposure of myeloid cells to the various inflammatory signals derived from inflamed tissue could lead to the generation of myeloid cells with an immunosuppressive state, called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which can exert protective or deleterious functions depending on the nature of signals and the specific inflammatory conditions created by different pathophysiological contexts. Initially identified in various tumor models and cancer patient samples, these cells have long been recognized as negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Consequently, researchers have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying their potent immunosuppressive activity. As a key component of the signal transducing processes, protein kinases play a central role in regulating the signal transduction mechanisms of many cellular activities, including differentiation and immunosuppression. Over the past decade, at least a dozen kinases, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TAM RTKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and others, have emerged as key contributors to the generation and differentiation of MDSCs. Here, we discuss the recent findings on these kinases that directly contribute to the immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs.">

        <tr id="Background T-cell engagers (TCEs), the most extensively studied class of bispecific antibodies, redirect effector T cells to tumor cells to induce immune synapse formation, T-cell activation, and subsequent tumor cell killing. However, their therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors is limited by immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To address this challenge, we engineered an enhanced PSMA/CD3 bispecific antibody by incorporating the extracellular domain of CD80, which provides a co-stimulatory signal to counteract T-cell inhibition in prostate cancer. This trifunctional antibody is designated as TriTE-N13. Methods We engineered the fully humanized fusion antibody TriTE-N13 using gene editing and eukaryotic expression systems. In vitro, we evaluated its ability to activate and proliferate T cells, as well as its cytotoxicity against PSMA+ tumor cells in both 2D co-culture and 3D spheroid models. Additionally, we assessed the in vivo antitumor efficacy and safety of TriTE-N13 using human immune-reconstituted mouse models bearing prostate cancer xenografts. Results In vitro, TriTE-N13 demonstrated robust activation of human T cells and high-affinity binding to both human PSMA and CD3 antigens. Furthermore, TriTE-N13 effectively mediated T-cell-dependent cytotoxicity against PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells. In vivo studies revealed that TriTE-N13 achieved significantly greater tumor volume reduction compared to conventional bispecific TCEs, particularly in established large tumors. Conclusions Our findings indicate that incorporating CD80 as a co-stimulatory signal substantially enhances the antitumor efficacy of TCEs against solid tumors. These results position TriTE-N13 as a promising immunotherapeutic candidate for advanced prostate cancer treatment.

        <tr id="Innate immune cells constitute the majority of the tumor microenvironment (TME), where they mediate both natural anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy responses. While single-cell T- and B-cell receptor sequencing has provided fundamental insights into the clonal dynamics of human adaptive immunity, the lack of appropriate tools has precluded similar analysis of innate immune cells. Here, we describe a method that leverages somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to reconstruct clonal lineage relationships between single cells across cell types in native human tissues. We jointly sequenced single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin and mtDNA to profile n=124,958 cells from matched tumor, non-involved lung tissue (NILT), and peripheral blood of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, as well as n=93,757 cells from matched tumor and peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients. Single-cell concomitant profiling of lineage and cell states of thousands of immune cells resolved clonality across cell types, tissue sites, and malignancies. Clonal tracing of innate immune cells demonstrates that TME-resident myeloid subsets, including macrophages and type 3 dendritic cells (DC3), are clonally linked to both circulating and tissue-infiltrating monocytes. Further, we identify distinct DC-biased and macrophage-biased myeloid clones, enriched in the tumor and NILT, respectively, and find that their circulating monocyte precursors exhibit distinct epigenetic profiles, suggesting that myeloid differentiation fate may be predetermined before TME infiltration. These results delineate the clonal pathways of intratumoral myeloid cell recruitment and differentiation in human cancer and suggest that remodeling of the tumor myeloid compartment may be peripherally programmed.">

        <tr id="Cellular and molecular heterogeneity contributes to the insufficient immunogenicity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a lethal malignancy characterized by post-resection relapse, ultimately leading to limited immune cell infiltration. Here, we report a strategy to boost tumor immunity by activating the endogenous cGAS-STING signaling pathway through in-situ manipulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), thereby augmenting the immune responsiveness of GBM. Under white light irradiation, the synthetic butterfly-shaped photosensitizer B-TTPy disrupts the mitochondrial ETC by producing excessive reactive oxygen species. Synergistically, inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 amplifies ETC dysfunction, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of B-TTPy against tumor cells. Our results demonstrate that the in-house-customized Mitochondrial Electron Alteration Nanoparticles in Glioblastoma (MEANING) efficiently activate innate and adaptive immune response by recruiting antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells to the surgical margin. Moreover, biodegradable hydrogel-medicated surgical cavity treatment with MEANING can reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and eliminate residual GBM cells. In sum, our findings establish a local immune activation approach for GBM, to prevent postoperative tumor recurrence and identify ETC blockade as a promising therapeutic strategy for low-immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing effector T cell responses. However, in chronic inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthritis (SpA) and psoriasis (PsO), Tregs can lose their stability and acquire pro-inflammatory characteristics, a phenomenon known as Treg plasticity. Under inflammatory conditions, Tregs may downregulate FoxP3, upregulate RORγt, and produce cytokines such as IL-17 and IFN-γ, thus losing their suppressive function and contributing to disease progression. In SpA, altered numbers and impaired Treg function have been identified in peripheral blood and synovial fluid. Specific subsets, such as CD161+ Tregs with Th17-like features, suggest that inflammatory cytokines and signals like STAT3 activation and ICOS engagement promote pathogenic reprogramming. Genetic factors, including HLA-B27, may further predispose Tregs to instability. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses have provided evidence of shared TCR repertoires between Tregs and effector T cells, reinforcing the concept of lineage plasticity. Similarly, in PsO, skin-resident Tregs exposed to IL-23, IL-6, and IL-21 can acquire a Th17-like phenotype, producing IL-17A and exacerbating local inflammation. Environmental factors such as hypoxia also contribute to destabilizing Treg identity. The persistence of pathogenic Tregs, even following therapy blockade of IL-17 or IL-23, highlights the challenge of achieving long-term disease remission.">

        <tr id="Endometrial carcinoma (EC) represents one of the most prevalent malignancies within the female reproductive system. The frequency of its occurrence is on the rise annually, and patients diagnosed at advanced stages face a less favorable prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the significant influence of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) on the initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance of endometrial cancer. The TME encompasses various components such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). These elements contribute to an immunosuppressive milieu by secreting cytokines, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and engaging immune checkpoint pathways like PD-1/PD-L1, thereby supporting tumor immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review synthesizes current understanding of the EC-TME, focusing on the distinct roles and interactions of its key constituents within the context of EC biology. Furthermore, we explore the rationale and progress for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the TME, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, combination therapies, and nano delivery systems leveraging EVs, aiming to provide insights for improving EC patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, presenting a significant clinical challenge due to its high metastatic potential and limited response to conventional systemic therapies. While immunotherapy has transformed the treatment landscape for numerous cancers, its effectiveness in UM has been substantially limited, primarily due to the tumor’s distinct immune-evasive characteristics and a suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This review systematically examines the multiple mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance in UM, including low tumor mutational burden, immune checkpoint overexpression, metabolic adaptations, and the epigenetic silencing of immune-stimulatory genes. Additionally, we analyze emerging strategies aimed at modifying the TME to enhance immune recognition and response, which include targeting suppressive immune cell populations, addressing metabolic and hypoxic barriers, and utilizing epigenetic modulators to restore immune activation pathways. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in identifying predictive biomarkers—such as genetic mutations (e.g., BAP1, MBD4), immune gene signatures, circulating tumor DNA, and protein-based blood markers—that may facilitate patient stratification and treatment selection. We also examine novel combination approaches that integrate immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies, radiation, metabolic interventions, or engineered cellular therapies, several of which have shown promising clinical potential in overcoming UM’s inherent resistance mechanisms. Despite persistent challenges, such as toxicity management and limited availability of large-scale trials due to UM’s rarity, the integration of multi-omics profiling, precision medicine frameworks, and adaptive trial designs presents new opportunities for therapeutic advancement. This review provides a translational perspective on enhancing immunotherapy efficacy in UM by addressing its unique biology and identifying future directions for clinical innovation.">

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional T and NK-cell signatures underpin dengue pathogenesis and may represent novel targets for immunomodulatory therapy in dengue.">

In the peripheral blood and ascites, Breg frequency was significantly higher in patients with GC with PM than in those without PM. In clinical PM samples, Breg frequency was an independent prognostic factor. In the mouse PM model, peritoneal tumors showed higher Breg infiltration than subcutaneous tumors. In the PTEN-deficient PM model, activation of Bregs promoted ascites and peritoneal tumor growth, decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and increased the infiltration of M2 macrophages. In contrast, treatment with wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, suppressed Breg infiltration, resulting in decreased M2 macrophage infiltration and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Objectives A pivotal role of cancer (e.g., glioma) microenvironment is primarily executed by tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating cancer immune evasion and even resisting immunotherapies. However, the molecular base for governing such functionality of TAMs remains poorly understood. Thereby, we here explore the impact of such a key regulatory transcription factor NFE2L1 (also called Nrf1) on glioma‐relevant TAMs. Methods A set of combining in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, e.g., by utilizing CRISPR‐Cas9 and overexpression plasmids to modulate NFE2L1 expression, and the resulting phenotypic changes in TAMs were evaluated. Besides, immunofluorescence, RT‐qPCR and flow cytometry were conducted to assay the infiltration of various immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and M1‐type macrophages, in the glioma microenvironment, as well as their therapeutic response to anti‐PD1 treatment. Results Deficiency of NFE2L1 causes a unique phenotypic switch in the TAMs from its pro‐cancer M2‐type to another anti‐cancer M1‐type, thereby inhibiting malignant progression of glioma. Such NFE2L1‐deficiency leads to significantly increases of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages within tumor tissues of glioma and hence enhances its sensitivity to anti‐PD1 therapy. Further experimental evidence has provided revealing a synergistic efficacy triggered by combined therapy of CD38 inhibitor with PD1 antibodies, significantly inhibited tumor growth, compared to that of their monotherapy. The mechanistic study unraveled that NFE2L1 enables for directly binding to those ARE sites within the promoter regions of both CD38 and PD‐L1 genes in order to govern their transcriptional expression. Conclusions The aberrant role of NFE2L1 in the malignant progression of glioma was discovered in this study. It is of crucial significance to emphasize the potential of NFE2L1 inhibition as a strategic approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic intervention. Overall, this discovery holds a substantial promise for advancement of innovative combination therapies, potentially enhancing treatment outcomes for individuals afflicted with glioma.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The management of HNC is a major global challenge, with chemo-radiotherapy resistance and a low 5-year survival rate. Recently, the FDA has approved anti-PD1/PDL1-based immunotherapies for the better management and longer survival of HNC patients. However, immune-escaping mechanisms mitigate the antitumoral effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based therapies. Dysregulated miRNAs are increasingly recognized as key players in immune evasion mechanisms through the modulation of several immune signaling pathways that are essential for antitumor immune responses. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs whose dysregulation is closely associated with immune-escaping mechanisms and lower survival rates in HNC patients. The present study found some key miRNAs that are associated with lower survival rates and immune evasion mechanisms. Targeting the identified miRNAs can help modulate immune evasion mechanisms and possibly enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, including other immune checkpoint therapies in HNC.">

Moreover, our investigation underscores the enrichment of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-1 signaling pathways within myeloid populations at 2-3 dpi in comparison to baseline. These findings substantially deepen our comprehension, elucidating the transcriptional landscape at the single-cell level during the early phases of COVID-19 within a highly relevant model.


IMPORTANCE
Understanding the immune response in the early stages of COVID-19 is crucial for developing better treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the first few days after infection. We identify key immune cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that are activated early on and produce important signals to fight the virus. These findings help clarify how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights that could guide future therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Background/Aims Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a severe complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, characterized by immune-mediated tissue damage primarily affecting the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis. However, the pathogenic roles of changes in Treg cell number and function on acute GvHD remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes in Treg cells and their clinical and pathogenic implication of acute GvHD. Methods A total of 62 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation at a tertiary institution from 2019 to 2024 were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Treg cell subsets and cytokine production were assessed after T-cell receptor stimulation. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured using cytometric bead array, and Treg cell suppressive function was evaluated through co-culture experiments. Results Patients with acute GvHD showed a decreased frequency of circulating Treg cells, with a notable increase in the CD45RA-FoxP3lo pro-inflammatory subset. Treg cells produced inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α upon stimulation and exhibited reduced suppressive activity. The frequency of TNF-α+ Treg cells correlated with the clinical severity of acute GvHD. Elevated serum levels of IL-6 and IL-21 were associated with the inflammatory conversion of Treg cells. Conclusions During human acute GvHD, frequencies of circulating Treg cells are significantly decreased. Inflammatory change of Treg cells, represented by TNF-α production and reduced suppressive capacity, contributes to the immunopathogenesis of acute GvHD.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are complex clinical conditions that present significant therapeutic challenges due to their intricate immunological mechanisms. Conventional treatment strategies, such as immunosuppressive drugs and anti-inflammatory therapies, often demonstrate limited efficacy and are associated with considerable side effects. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted growing interest as a promising therapeutic approach, owing to their immunomodulatory properties and ability to promote tissue repair. However, the direct application of MSCs faces several limitations, including the risk of immunogenicity and difficulties in large-scale production. In this context MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos), nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by MSCs, have emerged as a compelling alternative to cell-based therapies. Enriched with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, these exosomes exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Their primary mechanisms of action include enhancing the population of regulatory T cells, modulating macrophage polarization, and suppressing proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. The therapeutic potential of MSC-Exos extends beyond individual conditions, encompassing a wide range of autoimmune diseases. For instance in Behçet’s disease, they have been shown to regulate vasculitis and inflammatory processes by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and promoting endothelial cell regeneration. Moreover, MSC-Exos have demonstrated promising immunomodulatory effects in other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Through mechanisms such as inflammation suppression, vascular repair, and the restoration of immune homeostasis, MSC-Exos represent a versatile and innovative approach to autoimmune disease therapy. This review explored the molecular and therapeutic effects of MSCs and MSC-Exos in autoimmune diseases, with particular emphasis on their clinical potential in Behçet’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="The immunological synapse (IS) serves as the fundamental architectural framework for direct interactions and secretory crosstalk between immune cells, as well as between immune cells and other cells. Its dysregulation is thought to be a key underlying cause of immune evasion or inflammation observed in various diseases, including tumors and infections. Numerous recent studies have addressed key signaling mechanisms and reported novel targets related to IS, further broadening our understanding of its function and regulatory factors. However, a comprehensive review that highlights recent progress and consolidates past knowledge is still lacking. In this study, we delineated the pre- and postsynaptic structures constituting the IS between T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. We also detail the specific signaling mechanisms and pathways that modulate the formation and disassembly of the IS, including cytoskeletal remodeling, membrane reshaping, integrin signaling, and force transduction. Following these experimental findings, we systematically review the central roles of IS in maintaining homeostasis and health and outline various diseases arising from IS disorders. Finally, we thoroughly explore targets and treatments related to IS on the basis of preclinical evidence and clinical trials, with the aim of providing further investigatory and therapeutic insights for researchers and clinicians.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell engagers (TCEs) are a promising class of cancer immunotherapy that re-direct T cells to kill tumor cells. However, their clinical application is limited by several challenges, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), on-target off-tumor toxicity and overcoming immunosuppression in both hematological and solid tumors. This review explores recent innovations in TCE design aimed at improving their safety and efficacy. Key developments include optimizing geometry to facilitate effective immune synapses, affinity optimization of the anti-CD3/TCR domain and targeting of specific T cell subsets which both aim to reduce CRS. Logic-gated approaches such as dual-targeted and conditional TCEs activated by tumor microenvironment factors have the potential to reduce on target, off tumor toxicity and potentially increase the depth and durability of response. Additionally, leveraging costimulatory signaling offers the potential to further improve efficacy across hematological and solid tumor settings. The next generation of TCEs is expected to overcome some of the limitations of conventional TCEs, enhancing their therapeutic window and enabling combination therapies. As the field advances, TCEs are poised to become a cornerstone of cancer immunotherapy, potentially improving outcomes for a broader range of patients than the ones currently benefiting from conventional immunotherapy.">

This review explores the dual roles of CAFs in regulating tumor cell senescence and cell death, elucidating their mechanisms in inducing cellular senescence, shaping an immunosuppressive milieu, and modulating cell death pathways. CAFs promote tumor progression by secreting pro-inflammatory factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, while also contributing to metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, thereby influencing anti-cancer treatment efficacy. Studies indicate that the heterogeneity and plasticity of CAFs determine their distinct functions across various tumor types. Consequently, precision-targeted therapeutic strategies against CAFs, including the elimination of senescent CAFs, inhibition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and disruption of CAF-mediated cell death evasion mechanisms, have emerged as promising directions in cancer research. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of CAFs functions and their potential as therapeutic targets, offering valuable insights into the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women, with complex mechanisms driving its initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. In recent years, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has gained attention for its critical role in shaping tumor behavior, where small extracellular vesicles (small EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication. These vesicles carry a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, DNA, and various non-coding RNAs—such as miR-21, miR-155, and miR-1246—mirroring the molecular status of their originating cells. This review highlights the roles of small EVs in immune modulation, stromal remodelling, and metastatic niche formation, emphasizing their contribution to therapy resistance and immune evasion. We discuss recent updates on EV biogenesis, characterisation and isolation techniques, such as ultracentrifugation, immunoaffinity and microfluidic systems. We also critically evaluate their potential for clinical application and how well they conform to the MISEV2023 guidelines. Furthermore, we examine small EVs as diagnostic tools in liquid biopsies and compare them with conventional methods such as mammography and tissue biopsies. We also discuss organotropism mediated by small EV cargo (e.g., integrins α6β4, αvβ5) and the diagnostic potential of protein and lipid signatures (e.g., PD-L1, CD63, and exosomal lipidomics). Therapeutically, we explore engineered small EVs for drug delivery, gene modulation, and immune activation, addressing challenges of targeting efficiency, in vivo stability, immunogenicity, and clinical scalability. The review discusses ongoing clinical trials involving small EVs in BC and highlights key translational gaps between preclinical advances and clinical implementation. Finally, we explores how integrating artificial intelligence, single-cell transcriptomics, and multi-omics approaches can help overcome major challenges such as small EV heterogeneity and tracking limitations. Crucially, this integration enables a more tailored understanding of each patient’s tumor biology, reducing therapeutic failures by guiding more personalized and effective treatment strategies. Overall, small EVs represent a transformative tool in precision oncology, contingent on resolving key challenges in their clinical translation.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the tumor microenvironment (TME), interacting with cancer cells and other components to promote tumor growth. Given the influence of TAMs on tumor progression and resistance to therapy, regulating the activity of these macrophages is crucial for improving cancer treatment outcomes. TAMs often exhibit immunosuppressive phenotypes (commonly referred to as M2-like macrophages), which suppress immune responses and contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, inhibiting immunosuppressive polarization offers a promising strategy to impede tumor growth. This study revealed retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ), a nuclear receptor, as a key regulator of immunosuppressive polarization in THP-1 macrophages. Indeed, the inhibition of RARγ, either by a small molecule or gene silencing, significantly reduced the expression of immunosuppressive macrophage markers. In a three-dimensional tumor spheroid model, immunosuppressive macrophages enhanced the proliferation of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, which was significantly hindered by RARγ inhibition. These findings suggest that targeting RARγ reprograms immunosuppressive macrophages and mitigates the tumor-promoting effects of TAMs, highlighting RARγ as a promising therapeutic target for developing novel anti-cancer strategies.">

Hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1-associated protein X 1 (HAX1), encoded by the primary pathogenic gene of autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia, serves as a key target for in-depth exploration of neutrophil function. In the Hax1 myeloid knockout C57BL/6J mice and stably transduced HL-60 cells with HAX1 knockdown that we constructed, our results showed that the differentiation of granulocyte-monocyte precursor cells (GMPs) and the maturation of neutrophils were inhibited, significantly reducing the proportion of myeloid cells and neutrophils in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. In addition, HAX1 deletion disrupted mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial membrane potential in neutrophils and increased the protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members and cleaved Caspase-9. Through RNA sequencing and mRNA validation, we further demonstrated that HAX1 regulates neutrophil apoptosis and maturation via the mitochondrial-mediated classical apoptotic pathway and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated purine-rich box 1 (PU.1) signaling. This study elucidated the critical role of HAX1 in neutrophil differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis, providing new targets for research into neutrophil-related diseases.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

cells without prior antigen sensitization. Unlike T cells, NK cells function independently of
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) restriction, making them effective against tumors that
evade adaptive immune responses. However, several challenges, including limited persistence, poor
tumor infiltration, and immune suppression, hinder their clinical efficacy, particularly in solid tumors.
Recent advancements in NK cell expansion, activation, and genetic engineering have significantly
enhanced their therapeutic potential. Strategies such as cytokine-mediated stimulation, artificial
scaffolds, and CRISPR-based modifications have improved NK cell persistence and cytotoxicity.
Additionally, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-modified NK cells offer targeted tumor recognition
while minimizing the risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) and Cytokine Release Syndrome
(CRS), making them a safer alternative to CAR-T therapy. Despite these advancements, immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironments and high manufacturing costs remain key obstacles.
Emerging approaches, including metabolic reprogramming, synthetic biology, and combinatorial
therapies integrating checkpoint inhibitors and bispecific antibodies, hold promise for overcoming
these limitations. Furthermore, the development of off-the-shelf, induced Pluripotent Stem Cell
(iPSC)-derived NK therapies is expected to enhance scalability and accessibility. This review highlights
the latest progress in NK cell-based immunotherapy, addressing both current challenges and
future directions in optimizing NK cell expansion, activation, and genetic engineering for clinical
applications.

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation. While microglia and astrocytes dominate CNS immune responses, emerging evidence implicates peripheral innate immune cells (PIICs)—including neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—as critical modulators of AD pathogenesis. This review synthesizes recent advances linking PIIC-related genetic polymorphisms to AD susceptibility and progression. We highlight how PIICs traffic into the brain via chemokine signaling, where they exhibit stage-specific effects: early recruitment may limit Aβ deposition via phagocytosis, whereas chronic infiltration exacerbates neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Paradoxically, some PIICs exert immunosuppressive effects that could be harnessed therapeutically. We further discuss preclinical strategies to modulate PIIC function, such as CCR2 inhibition, neutrophil depletion, and MDSC adoptive transfer. By bridging peripheral and central immunity, this review unveils PIICs as promising targets for next-generation AD therapies, advocating for precision immunomodulation tailored to disease stages.">

        <tr id="Introduction Malaria acute kidney injury (MAKI) is associated with severe malaria and correlates with poor prognosis and death of patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The pathogenesis of MAKI is not completely understood but some hypotheses are well recognized. Host–parasite interactions lead to mechanical obstruction, disorders in the renal microcirculation, and immune-mediated glomerular injury. We investigated the influence of CD8⁺ T cells in the pathogenesis of malaria-induced renal disease. Methods To assess the role of T lymphocytes in MAKI pathogenesis, we used adoptive transfer; antibody-driven CD8+ T cells depletion and treatment with FYT720. Results The transference of total T cells isolated from malaria-infected donor mice into naive recipient animals reproduced kidney tubule-interstitial damage without affecting glomerular function. It was associated with increased accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the kidneys of recipient mice. The selective depletion of CD8+ T cells in infected animals resulted in protection from tubular injury, although glomerular alterations still occurred. Finally, we evaluated FTY720, an immunomodulatory drug that sequesters T cells in lymphoid organs and limits their migration, as a potential therapeutic strategy. Treatment with FTY720 prevented the development of proteinuria and the increase in the urine to creatinine ratio. Moreover, FTY720 reduced urinary γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) levels, a marker of tubular injury, but did not alter plasma urea and creatinine, two markers of glomerular function. Discussion Our results add new knowledge demonstrating that CD8+ T cells have a specific role in tubule-interstitial injury pathology during MAKI.">

        <tr id="The anti-tumor role of the immune system has long been associated with interferon-γ-mediated activation of immune cells and their ability to recognize and eliminate transformed cells. Fundamental principles of tumor immunoediting describe a dynamic interplay between the immune system and neoplastic cells, wherein immune pressure can paradoxically shape tumor evolution. Within this context, macrophages, natural killer cells, and T lymphocytes are central effectors of anti-tumor immunity. Traditionally, macrophages exhibiting M1 phenotype are characterized by high cytotoxic potential and considered important contributors to tumor eradication. In contrast, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages are associated with immune suppression and tumor progression. However, recent evidence challenges this binary paradigm. It is increasingly evident that M1 macrophages, while initially exerting anti-tumor effects, can also promote tumor progression by applying sustained cytotoxic pressure that selects for more malignant and immune-resistant tumor clones. This phenomenon represents an unexpected and overlooked contribution of cytotoxic macrophages to tumor progression. In this review, we examine the complex, context-dependent function of M1 macrophages and reassess current strategies aimed at enhancing their cytotoxicity. While such approaches may offer short-term benefits, they risk driving clonal selection of aggressive, immune-evasive tumor cells. Therefore, we propose a paradigm shift: instead of promoting M1 polarization alone, therapeutic strategies should consider the broader consequences of macrophage–tumor interactions. A nuanced understanding of macrophage plasticity and tumor dynamics is essential for designing effective immunotherapies. Recognizing the paradoxical role of M1 macrophages is critical to avoiding unintended support of tumor evolution and improving treatment outcomes.">

Leveraging the high susceptibility and tractability of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), 113,356 single immune cells are profiled from head kidney and spleen across multiple infection time points (0, 1, 5, 10, 75 days post-infection and 3 days post-reinfection). This single-cell transcriptomic and flow cytometry analyses revealed distinct activation and transition patterns among neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Neutrophils exhibited early transcriptional remodeling enriched in inflammatory and interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling pathways. Cross-species integration identified a conserved IFNγ-driven transition toward il8⁺ neutrophils. Furthermore, recombinant interleukin-8 (IL8) enhanced antibacterial responses in tilapia and human neutrophils, while inhibition of STAT1 reduced IL8 expression. IL8 stimulation increased phagocytosis and  reactive oxygen species (ROS） production, supporting its role in neutrophil-mediated bacterial clearance. Together, this findings establish IFNγ-IL8 as a conserved mechanism in vertebrate immunity and a potential target for antibacterial therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults. Extensive research has elucidated the broad spectrum of biological mechanisms contributing to the development of AML and specifically characterized a variety of genetic alterations initiating and defining the disease. However, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AML remains relatively unexplored; indeed, studies on the contribution of inflammatory signaling to disease initiation in myeloid malignancies have only recently gained attention, marking an emerging area of research. AML has the highest incidence in the elderly, where inflammation plays an even greater role. A granular understanding of inflammatory processes driving leukemogenesis thus promises to guide therapeutic strategies for a patient population where outcomes remain dismal. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge on the role of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis. It discusses the role of inflammation from premalignant states through malignant transformation, dissecting phenotypic, correlative studies from mechanistic evidence. We thereby highlight questions requiring further research to exploit the translational potential of therapies targeting inflammatory signaling and to address challenges with current immune‐modulating treatments. A particular focus is placed on assessing the role of inflammation in the interplay with genetic events as established factors in disease initiation and progression to clarify the current understanding of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="HIV infection accelerates biological aging, but the contribution of the host’s age to this process is unknown. We investigated the influence of SIV infection in macaques (SIVmac) on the risk of comorbidities and aging in young and old rhesus macaques (RMs) by assessing pathogenesis markers, DNA methylation–based epigenetic age (EA), and EA acceleration (EAA) in blood and tissues. Initially, upon SIV infection, the young RMs showed greater resilience to CD4+ T cell depletion, better control of T cell activation, hypercoagulation, and excessive inflammation, yet this resilience was progressively lost in the advanced stages of infection. During the late stages of infection, the young RMs, but not the aged ones, showed an increase in EA in PBMCs; also, EAA in the cerebellum and heart of young RMs was higher compared with old RMs. SIV infection was more pathogenic in aged animals in early stages, leading to a more rapid disease progression; however, accelerated aging mostly affected young animals, so that the levels of multiple key pathogenesis markers in the young RMs converged toward those specific to aged ones in the late stages of infection. We conclude that SIV infection–driven age acceleration is tissue specific, and that host age influences the susceptibility of different tissues to enhanced aging.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (Tumor Microenvironment, TME) is a core regulatory factor in the occurrence, development, and treatment resistance of tumors. Macrophages, as key immune cell components in the TME, have a profound impact on the tumor process (Visser and Joyce in Cancer Cell 41:374–403, 2023). This review aims to systematically elucidate the characteristics and functional differences of macrophage polarization into M1 and M2 phenotypes within the TME. Additionally, it endeavors to dissect the regulatory mechanisms by which metabolic products, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components secreted by tumor cells modulate macrophage polarization (Wang et al. in Mol Cancer 23:268, 2024). Moreover, the metabolic reprogramming of tumorassociated macrophage (TAM) is a core mechanism for their functional shift, and intervening in metabolic pathways holds promise for reprogramming TAMs to inhibit tumor progression (Jin et al. in Nat Cancer 6:239–252, 2025). Within the TME, macrophages can be polarized into classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 types (Ge and Wu in Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi 26:228–237, 2023). Accumulating evidence indicates that classically activated M1 macrophages orchestrate anti-tumor immunity by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which collectively activate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, induce tumor cell apoptosis, and enhance immune surveillance (Luo et al. in Front Immunol 15:1352946, 2024). In contrast, M2 macrophages are induced in the TME and promote tumor angiogenesis, immune evasion, tumor cell proliferation, and metastasis by secreting factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (Wang et al. in NPJ Precis Oncol 8:31, 2024). Therefore, in-depth research on the mechanisms of macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment provides an important basis for developing new tumor immunotherapy strategies and has significant clinical translational value.">

While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGFβ-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGFβ expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.">

        <tr id="Background CNS stromal cells, especially fibroblasts and endothelial cells, support leukocyte accumulation through upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines. While chronically activated fibroblast networks can drive pathogenic immune cell aggregates known as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), early stromal cell activation during CNS infection can support anti-viral T cells. However, the cell types and factors driving early stromal cell activation is poorly explored. Aims A neurotropic murine coronavirus (mCoV) infection model was used to better characterize signals that promote fibroblast networks supporting accumulation of antiviral lymphocytes. Based on the early appearance of IgD+ B cells with unknown functions during several CNS infections, we probed their potential to activate stromal cells through lymphotoxin β (LTβ), a molecule critical in maintaining fibroblast-networks in lymphoid tissues as well as promoting TLS in autoimmunity and cancers. Results Kinetic analysis of stromal cell activation in olfactory bulbs and brains revealed that upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines Ccl19, Ccl21 and Cxcl13 closely tracked viral replication. Immunohistochemistry revealed that upregulation of the fibroblast marker podoplanin (PDPN) at meningeal and perivascular sites mirrored kinetics of RNA expression. Moreover, both B cells and T cells colocalized to areas of PDPN reactivity, supporting a potential role in regulating stromal cell activation. However, specific depletion of LTβ from B cells using Mb1-creERT2 x Ltβfl/fl mice had no effect on T or B cell recruitment or viral replication. B cell depletion by anti-CD20 antibody also had no adverse effects. Surprisingly, LTβR agonism reduced viral control and parenchymal T cell localization despite increasing stromal cell lymphoid chemokines and PDPN. Additional assessment of direct stromal cell activation by the viral RNA mimic poly I:C showed induction of Pdpn and Ccl19 preceding Ltb. Conclusions Neither B cell-derived LTβ or B cells are primary drivers of stromal cell activation networks in the CNS following mCoV infection. Although supplementary agonist mediated LTβR engagement confirmed a role for LTβ in enhancing PDPN and lymphoid chemokine expression, it impeded T cell migration to the CNS parenchyma and viral control. Our data overall indicate that stromal cells can integrate LTβR signals to tune their activation, but that LTβ is not necessarily essential and can even dysregulate protective antiviral T cell functions.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies. Radiotherapy (RT), traditionally valued for its cytotoxic effects, has recently been recognized for its immunomodulatory potential. This mini-review explores the multifaceted interactions between RT and the PDAC immune microenvironment, highlighting mechanisms such as induction of immunogenic cell death, enhancement of antigen presentation, modulation of cytokine and chemokine profiles, and upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules. These effects may transform immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” ones, providing a rationale for combination strategies with immunotherapy. However, the dense desmoplastic stroma, abundance of regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells within PDAC present substantial challenges that hinder effective immune activation. Advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies offer new opportunities to better characterize the TME and guide personalized treatment strategies. By synthesizing mechanistic insights and clinical evidence, this review underscores the potential of integrating RT with immunotherapy to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve therapeutic outcomes in PDAC.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the severe progression of an infection with Plasmodium falciparum, causing detrimental damage to brain tissue and is the most frequent cause of Plasmodium falciparum mortality. The critical role of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the pathophysiology of CM having been revealed, our investigation focuses on the role of NR2F6, an established immune checkpoint, as a candidate driver of CM pathology. We employed an experimental mouse model of CM based on Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection to compare the relative susceptibility of Nr2f6-knock-out and wild-type C57BL6/N mice. As a remarkable result, Nr2f6 deficiency confers a significant survival benefit. In terms of mechanism, we detected less severe endotheliopathy and, hence, less damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), accompanied by decreased sequestered parasites and less cytotoxic T-lymphocytes within the brain, manifesting in a better disease outcome. We present evidence that NR2F6 deficiency renders mice more resistant to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), confirming a causal and non-redundant role for NR2F6 in the progression of ECM disease. Consequently, pharmacological inhibitors of the NR2F6 pathway could be of use to bolster BBB integrity and protect against CM.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy exhibits a robust therapeutic efficacy against B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma, its efficacy and safety have not been established for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and solid tumors due to the paucity of established target antigens. Some AML and solid tumor cells express tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is initially expressed on the cell surface prior to shedding. Methods In this study, we obtained monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal fragment of TNF (TNF-NTF) that remains on the cell surface after shedding. We then generated CAR-T cells to target TNF-NTF using the antibody sequence. To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TNF-NTF CAR-T cells, we further engineered the previously developed chimeric cytokine receptor consisting of GP130, IL6R, and constitutively active IL7R with the M452L mutation (G6/7R). Results TNF-NTF CAR-T cells efficiently lysed TNF-expressing leukemia cells in vitro, while showing limited antitumor efficacy in vivo due to poor expansion and persistence. Activated T cells upregulate TNF, which was recognized by TNF-NTF CAR-T cells and led to fratricide. Genetic knockout (KO) of TNF significantly enhanced the viability and proliferation of TNF-NTF CAR-T cells, while slightly reducing their cytotoxic activity. In addition, ectopic expression of G6/7R improved the effector function of TNF-NTF CAR-T cells through constitutive activation of janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling. The G6/7R-expressing TNF-KO TNF-NTF CAR-T cells exhibited superior persistence and durable antileukemic efficacy in vivo compared with parental CAR-T cells. We also confirmed that TNF-NTF CAR-T cells can target primary AML cells, including a leukemia-initiating population with colony-forming capacity. Unlike CD33, targeting TNF-NTF did not show cytotoxicity against normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Finally, we demonstrated the curative efficacy of G6/7R TNF-KO TNF-NTF CAR-T cells against TNF-expressing ovarian tumor cells in vivo. Conclusions Our studies highlight TNF-NTF as a promising cell surface target for CAR-T cell therapy that can be applied to AML as well as solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are initially efficacious against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive lung adenocarcinoma (ALK+ LUAD), but acquired resistance inevitably occurs. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are needed for TKI-resistant cases. Although the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, patients with ALK+ LUAD exhibit little or no response to immunotherapy and the underlying resistance mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we explored the immunological status of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in ALK+ LUAD tissues. Tumor-infiltrating leukocyte analysis revealed reduced numbers of effector T cells and increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) relative to ALK- LUAD cases, indicating that ALK+ LUAD has a myeloid cell-dominant immunosuppressive TME. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis identified a subset of macrophages that expressed most T cell-attractant chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), and the macrophages were inactivated in ALK+ LUAD. In contrast, ALK+ LUAD expressed high levels of MDSC-attractant chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL8). In addition, ALK+ LUAD showed higher levels of IL-6, an MDSC-inducing cytokine, than ALK- LUAD. An IL-6R inhibitor transformed the TME in a murine ALK+ LUAD model, shifting it from an immunosuppressive to a T cell-dominant status. Although ICI monotherapy lacked antitumor effects, a combination of ICI and the IL-6R inhibitor had significant antitumor effects in mice. Our findings illustrate the molecular basis of fusion gene-mediated immunosuppressive TMEs, providing a rationale for a novel combination immunotherapy for ALK+ LUAD.">

We show prolonged exposure to IL-35 converts both conventional and adaptive NK cells into CD9+CD103+CD49a+ ILC1-like cells via autocrine TGF-β. We assess cancer patient-derived public datasets and reveal the presence of IL-35-producing cells and IL-35-receptor-expressing NK/ILC1-like cells within the tumor microenvironment and associate IL-35 with poor prognosis. Collectively, our findings identify and implicate IL-35 as a key driver of NK cell plasticity, promoting the acquisition of features associated with tissue residency and weakened effector functions, and could be relevant in pathophysiological contexts, highlighting IL-35 as an attractive target for future immunotherapies aimed at enhancing NK cell clinical activity.">

        <tr id="Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by cartilage damage and bone erosion. Current pharmacological treatments often fail to repair damaged tissues and may cause severe immune-related side effects. Moreover, some patients exhibit inadequate responses to existing therapies. This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles (EV) derived from immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) overexpressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4Ig) (CT-EV) compared with iMSC-derived EVs (ASC-EV). Methods Following EV characterization and in vitro functional assessments, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model mice (n = 10/group) were treated with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS, 150 µL, twice weekly; Group C), ASC-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 106 iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group E), CT-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 106 CTLA4Ig-overexpressing iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group CT), or methotrexate (3 mg/kg, three times per week; Group M). A normal control group received dPBS (150 µL, twice weekly; Group N). Results CT-EV showed a significant increase in EV quantity and the production of CTLA4, transforming growth factor β1, and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist compared with ASC-EV. In mitogen-stimulated immune cells from CIA mice, CT-EV significantly reduced IL-6, IL-10, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Presumably Secreted (RANTES) levels. Administration of both ASC-EV and CT-EV led to a decrease in macrophage proportions and an increase in T helper type 2 cells and serum IL-4 levels. Furthermore, CT-EV treatment resulted in additional reductions in anti-CII antibody levels, C-telopeptide II concentrations, and the proportion of CD138⁺ cells, thereby contributing to cartilage protection. Conclusions CT-EV demonstrated superior therapeutic effects compared with ASC-EV in the CIA model, highlighting its potential as an effective treatment strategy for RA.

        <tr id="VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is an autoinflammatory disorder caused by acquired somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, affecting peripheral myeloid and natural killer (NK) cells. Given the high rate of severe infections observed in VEXAS patients, we hypothesized that NK cell dysfunction contributes to this increased susceptibility. We conducted a comprehensive immune characterization of peripheral NK cells in patients with VEXAS (n=40), patients with autoinflammatory diseases without UBA1 mutations (n=22), and elderly gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=16). Multiparameter phenotyping was performed using CyTOF, scRNAseq, whole blood stimulation assays and in vitro NK cell cytotoxic assay. Peripheral NK cells in VEXAS were quantitatively and qualitatively impaired. Mass cytometry revealed reduced frequencies of mature cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells and an expansion of the CD56high CD16dim subset. NK cells exhibited features of exhaustion, including increased PD-1 expression, and reduced levels of cytotoxic markers such as NKp46 and CD8α. scRNAseq analysis showed decreased signatures of cytotoxicity and IL-2 and IFN-γ production, alongside increased inflammatory signatures. Whole blood stimulation assays confirmed impaired IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B production following TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/TLR8 agonist stimulation. Extended NK phenotyping by flow cytometry confirmed reduced activating receptors' expression and impaired IFN-γ production in VEXAS. Moreover, in vitro UBA1 inhibitors impaired NK cell cytotoxic capacity and promote cell death. Finally, reduced NK cell frequencies were independently associated with an increased risk of severe infections. These findings suggest that NK cell dysfunction in VEXAS syndrome contributes to increased susceptibility to severe infections.">

        <tr id="Aim The primary goal of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate role that VEGF plays in creating an immunologically tolerant milieu in cases of OSCC or oral squamous cell carcinoma. Examining how VEGF affects the behavior and functionality of dendritic cells (DCs). Through an examination of the interactions among VEGF, DCs, and the tumor microenvironment. Methods This study investigated the expression of the immunosuppressive markers IDO and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in DCs under the effect of VEGF employing real-time PCR (RT-PCR), flow cytometry and Western blot (WB). Additionally, mixed lymphocyte reactions and tumor cell cytotoxicity assays were conducted to assess functional changes in DCs. Results VEGF exposure led to an upregulation of IDO and PD-L1 in DCs, coupled with reduced T-cell proliferation and altered immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. In vivo studies using mice models further substantiated the role of VEGF in enhancing tumor immune tolerance. Conclusion Our findings elucidate the crucial role of VEGF in OSCC progression by modulating DC function, offering new insights into potential immunotherapeutic strategies targeting VEGF-mediated pathways.

        <tr id="Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases worldwide, significantly impairing patients’ quality of life. It is characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions, intense pruritus, and disruption of the epidermal barrier. The pathogenesis of AD is multifactorial and involves complex interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, skin barrier defects, microbial dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation. While much of the research in recent decades has focused on the type 2 helper T cell (Th2)-driven adaptive immune responses that dominate the acute phase of the disease, the role of innate immunity—particularly that of myeloid cells—has emerged as a crucial and underrated component in disease pathogenesis and progression. This review highlights recent findings on the role of myeloid cells in the initiation, maintenance, and amplification of inflammation in AD. Myeloid cells respond to a wide range of environmental and tissue-derived triggers, including cytokines, alarmins, and microbial products. Upon activation, they contribute to the inflammatory milieu by producing chemokines and cytokines, presenting antigens, and recruiting other immune cells to the skin. Importantly, myeloid cells not only shape the local immune landscape but also engage in crosstalk with keratinocytes and adaptive immune cells, thereby reinforcing chronic inflammation. In addition, the review outlines emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating myeloid cell function or selectively targeting pro-inflammatory subsets. These approaches offer promising avenues that complement existing Th2-centered therapies, addressing disease mechanisms beyond the adaptive immune response. A deeper understanding of the diverse and dynamic roles of myeloid cells in AD may thus support the development of more comprehensive and personalized treatment strategies for long-term disease control.">

        <tr id="Aging increases the risk of developing fibrotic diseases by hampering tissue regeneration after injury. Using longitudinal single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, here we compare the transcriptome of bleomycin (BLM) -induced fibrotic lungs of young and aged male mice, at 3 time points corresponding to the peak of fibrosis, regeneration, and resolution. We find that lung injury shifts the transcriptomic profiles of three pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (PCEC) subpopulations. The associated signatures are linked to pro-angiogenic signaling with strong Lrg1 expression and do not progress similarly throughout the resolution process between young and old animals. Moreover, part of this set of resolution-associated markers is also detected in PCEC from samples of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we find that aging also alters the transcriptome of PCEC, which displays typical pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory features. We propose that age-associated alterations in specific PCEC subpopulations may interfere with the process of lung progenitor differentiation, thus contributing to the persistent fibrotic process typical of human pathology.">

However, the intricate mechanisms governing IgA class-switch recombination and its dysregulation in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease remain a significant challenge in the field. Our study delves into the significance of IgA regulation in mucosal immunity, focusing on the N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) in NIK mRNA by NAT10 in B cells. We discovered that NAT10-mediated ac4C stabilizes NIK mRNA, thereby promoting IgA production, which is pivotal for immune defense. Our findings in a B-cell conditional NAT10 knockout mouse model highlight a reduction in IgA expression and a dampened noncanonical NF-κB pathway, suggesting NAT10 as a potential therapeutic target for IgA-related disorders.

Therefore, TIM3 has been suggested as a potential target for AML treatment. Hence, we explored the feasibility of targeting TIM3 with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cells. Despite the expression of TIM3 on activated T‐cells, TIM3 CAR T‐cells were successfully generated from different healthy individuals with excellent in vitro expansion without signs of fratricide and sustained central‐memory phenotype with minimal expression of exhaustion‐related markers, including complete loss of TIM3 expression. TIM3 loss also did not affect effector functions since TIM3 CAR T‐cells efficiently lysed TIM3+ leukemic cell lines, produced Th1‐predominant cytokines, successfully inhibited the colony‐forming of TIM3+ AML‐derived LSPCs, and showed excellent AML tumor control in xenogeneic mouse models. Notably, TIM3 CAR T‐cells did not affect healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells and healthy mature hematopoietic cells that express TIM3 at moderate levels, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window for the treatment of AML.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunity response following vaccination and infection toward the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant remains limited in chronic liver disease (CLD) population. This study aims to investigate humoral and cell-mediate immunity to Omicron BA.4/5 among CLD patients with/without breakthrough infections (BI). This longitudinal study characterized immune responses to Omicron infection across three CLD patient groups: vaccinated without BI (group 1, n = 10), vaccinated with BI (group 2, n = 43), and unvaccinated infected (group 3, n = 7). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies/T-cell responses and lymphocyte phenotypes were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry. Logistic regression identified immunological correlates of BI event, viral clearance and liver disease progression. Dynamic immunity changes after infection analyzed using Spearman’s correlation. Patients in group 2 exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.4.5, anti-RBD IgG, and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to groups 1 and 3. Comparable T cell responses were observed between two vaccinated groups, stronger than unvaccinated individuals. Hybrid immune (vaccination plus infection) elicited stronger NAbs-WT, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, anti-RBD IgG, MBCs, and Omicron-specific IFN-γ+/IL-4+CD4+T cells compared to primary Omicron infection. Besides, severe liver disease was not only a risk factor for BI, but also impaired Omicron-specific IFN-γ+CD8+T, CD38+CD4+T, and CD45RA+CD8+T cells responses after infection. Importantly, IgG+/IgM+MBCs and NAbs showed positive associations with central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+CD4/8) or naive (CD45RA+CD62L+CD4) T cells. Low levels of CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+T cells and resting MBCs were identified as the independent risk factors for viral clearance and disease progression, respectively. BI predominantly stimulates humoral immunity without enhancing cellular responses. Weaker immune response induced by primary Omicron infection underscores the need for additional vaccinations in vaccine-naïve CLD patients. The positive correlations between humoral/cellular immunity and memory/activated T cells reveal their coordinated role in adaptive immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. These findings emphasize the importance of regular immune monitoring and timely interventions to optimize protection for CLD patients against emerging Omicron subvariants.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Colon cancer is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with significant global incidence and mortality. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in disease progression and treatment response. Among key components of the TME are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells, whose balance influences cancer outcomes.


METHODS
This review analyzes recent findings regarding the role of Treg cells in colon cancer progression by evaluating preclinical and clinical studies that explore immune cell composition, function, and modulation within the TME.


RESULTS
Treg cells demonstrate a dual role in colon cancer. While they suppress effective anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion, they may also mitigate chronic inflammation, which contributes to carcinogenesis. High intratumoral Treg levels are correlated with poor prognosis, reduced immunotherapy efficacy, and lower overall survival. Strategies to deplete or reprogram Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibition, modulation of T cell plasticity, and selective targeting, have shown promise in enhancing anti-tumor immunity.


DISCUSSION
Complete depletion of Tregs risks inducing autoimmune toxicity. Therefore, a precise understanding of Treg cell subsets and functions is essential. This review highlights the importance of developing targeted immunotherapeutic strategies that modulate Treg activity while preserving immune homeostasis in colon cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, plays a pivotal and multifaceted role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance by transducing extracellular mechanical stimuli—such as matrix stiffness and fluid shear stress—into intracellular calcium influx. In tumor cells, Piezo1 promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by activating oncogenic signaling and contributes to an immunosuppressive TME through regulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In the immune compartment, Piezo1 integrates mechanical cues with metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming to orchestrate the functions of T cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. Notably, Piezo1 deficiency impairs TH9 cell differentiation, diminishes T cell cytotoxicity, and enhances the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, Piezo1 expression correlates with distinct tumor immune phenotypes, such as “cold tumors,” and with responses to immunotherapy, making it a promising predictive biomarker for treatment efficacy. Given its dual regulatory roles in tumor biology and immune modulation, targeting Piezo1—such as through combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade—offers a potential strategy to reverse immunosuppression and enhance antitumor immunity. This review summarizes emerging insights into Piezo1’s role in cancer progression and immune regulation and highlights its translational potential as a novel target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute myocarditis (AM), particularly fulminant myocarditis (FM), is an infrequent but life-threatening cardiac inflammation, with limited effective precision-targeted treatments available. This urgent clinical challenge has prompted further investigations into the mechanisms underlying this pathology to develop novel therapeutic approaches.


METHODS
We enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with AM (24 mild, 16 fulminant) between December 2022 and November 2023. Using a multi-omics approach, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma-integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing, cytometry by time of flight, and Olink proteomics to identify specific pathogenic immune subsets and molecular alterations. In vitro experiments validated the function and inducing signals of identified pathogenic subsets. In coxsackievirus B3-induced FM mice, cytometry by time of flight analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cardiac infiltrating immune cells. Pharmacological blockade of key molecular was tested to assess potential therapeutic efficacy.


RESULTS
We identified that a specialized type of CD8+ effector T cells, CD57+CD8+ T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, were significantly enriched and exhibited large clonal expansion in AM. Differential expression analysis revealed upregulation of natural killer-like receptor genes in CD57+CD8+ effector T cells from FM compared with mild cases, which was positively associated with enhanced cytotoxicity and migration potential. In vitro experiments confirmed the existence of circulating CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxic degranulation and migration potential inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis, supporting their cardiac migration and cardiomyocyte cytotoxicity in pathogenesis. Elevated circulating interleukin (IL)-18 levels in patients with AM induced the functional differentiation of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In addition, increased proinflammatory CXCL8+CD14+ monocytes potentially contributed to increasing IL-18 levels and crosstalk with CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In FM mice, we observed the analogous expansions of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells and CXCL2+LY6C+ monocytes in both blood and hearts, accompanied by elevated plasma IL-18 levels. Disrupting the pathogenic axis involving proinflammatory monocytes, IL-18 signaling, and CCR5-mediated cardiac recruitment significantly alleviated FM in mice.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides a comprehensive immune landscape for understanding the pathogenesis of AM, especially in FM, highlighting clonal CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, along with their upstream inflammatory signals, as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating immune-related cardiac damage in AM management, especially in FM.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a highly aggressive subtype of lymphoma characterized by a poor prognosis. While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has emerged as an effective treatment modality for various cancers, its efficacy among individuals is inconsistent and remains suboptimal for the majority of NKTCL patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, recognized as a next-generation probiotic with immunomodulatory capabilities, has not yet been fully explored for its potential to influence the outcomes of ICB therapy. Methods We established syngeneic tumor-bearing mouse models of NKTCL and treated the mice with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and F. prausnitzii. Metabolomics analysis was performed to quantify butyrate concentrations in fecal, plasma, and tumor samples from the mice. Furthermore, we used flow cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to assess the effects of butyrate supplementation on antitumor immune responses in mice receiving anti-PD-L1 therapy. Additionally, an antibiotic-pretreated mouse model was utilized to further investigate the influence of F. prausnitzii on the efficacy of ICB therapy. Results The combination of F. prausnitzii and an anti-PD-L1 mAb effectively inhibited tumor growth, primarily through the action of its metabolite butyrate. Notably, F. prausnitzii-derived butyrate played a crucial role in enhancing the efficacy of ICB therapy by augmenting antitumor immune responses, as evidenced by reduced PD-L1 expression and increased levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, prior administration of antibiotics significantly compromised the efficacy of the anti-PD-L1 mAb. However, supplementation with F. prausnitzii mitigated the negative effects of antibiotics and restored the altered gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of F. prausnitzii in augmenting ICB therapy and presents a novel gut probiotic-centered therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NKTCL.

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for systemic sclerosis (SSc), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and vasculopathy. Recent evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefits of MSCs do not depend directly on their ability to proliferate but rather on their capacity to release extracellular nanovesicles known as exosomes (MSC-Exos). MSC-Exos are rich in bioactive molecules such as microRNAs, which can modulate gene expression and trigger significant biological responses, playing a central role in modulating immune responses, inhibiting fibrotic pathways and promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MSC-Exos can attenuate fibrosis, modulate macrophage polarization, suppress autoreactive lymphocyte activity, and even reverse pulmonary arterial hypertension in animal models of SSc. Compared to cell-based therapies, MSC-Exos offer several advantages, including lower immunogenicity and better safety profile. This review provides an overview of the immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and angiogenic properties of MSC-Exos and explores their potential as novel cell-free therapy for SSc.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different cell-type specific reprogramming as a result of B cell depletion treatment in MS.">

        <tr id="Aberrant immune response is a hallmark of asthma, with 5-10% of patients suffering from severe disease exhibiting poor response to standard treatment. A better understanding of the immune responses contributing to disease heterogeneity is critical for improving asthma management. T cells are major players in the orchestration of asthma, in both mild and severe disease, but it is unclear whether specific T cell subsets influence asthma symptom duration. Here we show a significant association of airway CD8+ effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRAs), but not CD8+ CD45RO+ or tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells, with asthma duration in patients with severe asthma (SA) but not mild to moderate asthma (MMA). Higher frequencies of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TEMRAs compared to IFN-γ+ CD45RO+ T cells were detected in SA airways, and the TEMRAs from SA but not MMA patients proliferated ex vivo, although both expressed cellular senescence-associated biomarkers. Prompted by the transcriptomic profile of SA CD8+ TEMRAs and proliferative response to IL-15, airway IL15 expression measured higher in SA compared to MMA patients. IL15 expression in asthmatic airways negatively correlated with lung function. Our findings add a new dimension to understanding asthma heterogeneity identifying IL-15 as a potential target for treatment.">

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibition (CPI) has reshaped cancer treatment, the majority of patients with cancer do not benefit from this approach, which can also cause immune-related adverse events. Induction of IFN-γ responses is thought be necessary for antitumor immunity, but growing evidence also implicates IFN-γ as a tumor-intrinsic mediator of CPI resistance. CPI-induced IFN-γ mediates activation-induced cell death in T cells as an immune-intrinsic mechanism of resistance. In this study, we found that transient block of IFN-γ signaling through administration of the JAK1 inhibitor ABT-317 enhanced antitumor T cell responses with CPI in preclinical models. Importantly, sequential but not concomitant ABT-317 treatment led to significantly reduced toxicity and improved tumor efficacy. Sequential treatment reduced activation-induced T cell death and enhanced expansion of tumor-reactive T cell subsets with increased effector function in vivo and ex vivo. Only CPI in combination with ABT-317 also enhanced memory responses by protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. These results demonstrate that JAK inhibition within a discrete time window following CPI addresses an immune-intrinsic mechanism of therapeutic resistance.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte B–cells (TIL-B) spans from antitumor responses to noncanonical immune suppression. Yet, how the tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single-cell transcriptomics and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells and memory and naive B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, a nonswitched memory B cell subset acquired an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25, and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells that in turn, dampen T cell costimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of noncanonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV treated during acute infection are the group for whom achieving functional cure appears most viable. Follicular CD8+ T cells could contribute to HIV reservoir clearance by accessing B cell follicles through CXCR5 expression. This study examines peripheral follicular CD8+ T cells using flow cytometry, transcriptome analyses, and functional assays in people treated during acute (n = 37) and chronic (n = 18) infection, as well as in individuals naturally controlling HIV (n = 20) and living without HIV (n = 10). Our results reveal that early, as opposed to late, treatment initiation preserves antiviral effector functions of follicular CD8+ T cells, which are further enhanced by PD1 inhibition. We also identify a correlation between follicular CD8+ T cells and intact proviral HIV DNA levels in acute, but not chronic, infection. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of peripheral effector cells after 48 weeks of suppressive therapy indicated traits of recent antigen exposure, suggesting potential recirculation into lymphoid tissue. These findings underscore the pivotal role of follicular CD8+ T cells in anti-HIV responses and support investigating targeted cure strategies, such as anti-PD1 therapy, especially in individuals initiating treatment during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade can facilitate tumor clearance by T cells, resulting in long term patient survival. However, the capacity of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex), present during chronic antigen exposure, to form memory after antigen clearance remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single cell RNA/T cell receptor sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on antigen-specific T cells after the clearance of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. These data revealed the formation of a robust population of memory CD8+ T cells that transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally resemble central memory T cells (Tcm) that form after clearance of acute infection. To lineage trace the origin and memory recall response of Tex-derived memory clones, we utilized T cell receptor sequencing over the course of primary infection and rechallenge. We show that chronic Tcm are a clonally distinct lineage of Tex derived from progenitor exhausted cells, persist long-term in the absence of antigen, and undergo rapid clonal expansion during rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that αPD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade after chronic LCMV infection preferentially expands clones which form Tcm after clearance. Together, these data support the concept that chronically stimulated T cells form bona fide functional memory T cells through an analogous differentiation pathway to acutely stimulated T cells, which may have significant implications for enhancing immune memory to cancer through checkpoint blockade and vaccination.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Arginine methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are crucial modulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses, and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages is critical in shaping the TME. Despite ongoing clinical trials of small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 for cancer therapy, their effects on macrophages, a key component of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Methods A pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis was initially conducted to investigate the expression of PRMT5 in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 in mice, as well as the use of a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, was performed to evaluate the impact of PRMT5 on macrophage polarization and tumor progression. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics were employed to explore the mechanistic roles of PRMT5 in regulating lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy was assessed to study its effects on antitumor immunity in vivo. Results The pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the PPARG-macrophage subset, which correlates with poor patient survival. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 reprogrammed macrophages towards an antitumor phenotype, effectively inhibiting tumor progression. Mechanistically, PRMT5 was found to regulate lipid metabolism and drive macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state via the STAT6-PPARγ pathway, fostering an immunosuppressive TME conducive to tumor growth. Notably, Prmt5 deletion induced PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy, demonstrating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Conclusions These findings uncover a crucial role for PRMT5 in macrophage biology and suggest that targeting PRMT5 in myeloid cells offers a promising new approach for cancer immunotherapy. The combination of PRMT5 inhibition with anti-PD-L1 therapy may provide a potent strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators of antiviral immunity, yet their role in lymphoid tissues—key reservoirs of HIV persistence—remains poorly defined. Here, we uncover a distinct cytotoxic signature of tonsil-resident NK cells essential for targeting HIV-infected CD4⁺ T cells. Using a human tonsillar model of HIV infection and extracellular matrix-based functional assays, we identify a subset of NK cells co-expressing CD69, CD49a, CD103, and the adaptive marker NKG2C as potent effectors against autologous HIV-infected tissue CD4⁺ T cells. Both CD16⁺ and CD16⁻ NK subsets exhibited cytotoxic antiviral activity. However, HIV infection induced profound functional alterations in these NK cells, including dysregulated expression of CD9, TRAF2, ITGA1, suggesting disrupted activation, signaling, and tissue residency. Functional assays corroborated a significant impairment in the cytotoxic capacity, indicating HIV-driven NK cell dysfunction. Intriguingly, a subset of immature CD16⁻CD69⁺ NK cells underwent functional reprogramming, transitioning into a migration-competent, and metabolically primed state, driven by the upregulation of NUMAI, LCP1, SLC38A1, MT-ND2, NUMA1, MYH9, and CD44. Functional assays confirmed this transition, revealing changes in the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and a gain of cytotoxic function in these reprogrammed cells. These findings advance our understanding of NK cell biology in HIV infection and highlight novel avenues for NK-cell-based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background The bone marrow (BM) niche contains non-hematopoietic elements including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC) which provide mechanical support, and control hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation. Although it is known that multiple myeloma (MM) cells interact closely with the BM microenvironment, little is known about the impact of MM on non-hematopoietic niche-forming cells. Methods To address the role of the niche in MM pathogenesis, we utilized the 5TGM1 murine model. During the asymptomatic precursor stage of the model, we isolated the rare non-hematopoietic cells and performed single cell RNA sequencing. Using in-silico methods we characterized the individual cellular components of the niche, their relative abundance and differentiation state before and after exposure to MM cells as well as their intercellular interactions. Results MM engraftment increased the abundance of MSC-lineage cells, BMECs and enhanced endothelial to mesenchymal transition. An inflammatory and oxidative stress signal was identified together with polarization of MSC differentiation away from osteocyte formation towards adipocytes which provide growth factors that are known to support MM expansion. BMEC differentiation was polarized towards sinusoidal endothelial cells with a pro-angiogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions MM cells impact the BM niche by generating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment with MSC differentiation being changed to generate cell subsets that favor MM growth and survival. In order to induce remission and improve long-term outcome for MM patients these inflammatory and oxidative stress signals need to be reduced and normal niche differentiation trajectories restored.

        <tr id="Background Myocarditis is a common inflammatory heart disease in children and young adults, with fulminant myocarditis (FM) being the most severe form due to its rapid onset and high mortality rate. However, the precise pathological immune subsets and molecular change in myocarditis, particularly FM, remain unknown. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of pediatric peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the acute and recovery phases of FM. A viral myocarditis (MC) mouse model was established using CVB3. Deletion and adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells, as well as blockade of CXCR4, were conducted in vivo. CD8+T cells were sorted and cultivated in vitro, then stimulated with CXCL12 and CXCR4 antagonists to investigate the mechanism of CD8+T cell overactivation. Results CD8+T cells show significant activation, amplification, enhanced cytotoxicity, and increased chemotactic ability in FM. Deletion of CD8+T cells alleviates myocardial injury and improves cardiac function in MC mice, while adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells from MC mice aggravates myocardial inflammation and injury. The transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated CXCR4 expression in CD8+T cells in acute FM. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis drives the overactivation and cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells. In vivo treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist effectively reduces CD8+T cell accumulation in the heart, alleviates myocardial inflammation, and improves cardiac function in MC mice. Conclusions These findings provide deeper insights into the immune landscape of pediatric FM, uncovering a novel role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in driving CD8+T cell responses in myocarditis. Furthermore, they highlight the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis as a promising therapeutic target for myocarditis treatment.

        <tr id="Drug-tolerant persister cancer cells were first reported fifteen years ago as a quiescent, reversible cell state which tolerates unattenuated cytotoxic drug stress. It remains unknown whether a similar phenomenon contributes to immune evasion. Here we report a persister state which survives weeks of direct cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) attack. In contrast to previously known immune evasion mechanisms that avoid immune attack, antigenic persister cells robustly activate CTLs which deliver Granzyme B, secrete IFNγ, and induce tryptophan starvation resulting in apoptosis initiation. Instead of dying, persister cells paradoxically leverage apoptotic caspase activity to avoid inflammatory death. Furthermore, persister cells acquire mutations and epigenetic changes which enable outgrowth of CTL-resistant cells. Persister cell features are enriched in inflamed tumors which regressed during immunotherapy in vivo and in surgically resected human melanoma tissue under immune stress ex vivo. These findings reveal a persister cell state which is a barrier to immune-mediated tumor clearance. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) depends on restoring immune recognition of cancer cells that have evaded immune surveillance. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is associated with immune-poor, so-called cold tumors whereas loss of its signaling promotes DNA misrepair that could stimulate immune response. Methods We analyzed transcriptomic data from IMvigor210, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Tumor Immune Syngeneic MOuse data sets to evaluate the predictive value of high βAlt, a score representing low expression of a signature consisting of TGFβ targets and high expression of genes involved in error-prone DNA repair. The immune context of βAlt was assessed by evaluating tumor-educated immune signatures. An ICB-resistant, high βAlt preclinical tumor model was treated with a TGFβ inhibitor, radiation, and/or ICB and assessed for immune composition and tumor control. Results We found that a high βAlt score predicts ICB response yet is paradoxically associated with an immune-poor tumor microenvironmentcancer in both human and mouse tumors. We postulated that high βAlt cancers consist of cancer cells in which loss of TGFβ signaling generates a TGFβ rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, preclinical modeling showed that TGFβ inhibition followed by radiotherapy could convert an immune-poor, high βAlt tumor to an immune-rich, ICB-responsive tumor. Mechanistically, TGFβ inhibition increased activated natural killer (NK) cells, which were required to recruit lymphocytes to respond to ICB in irradiated tumors. NK cell activation signatures were also increased in high βAlt, cold mouse and human tumors that responded to ICB. Conclusions These studies indicate that loss of TGFβ signaling competency and gain of error-prone DNA repair identifies a subset of cold tumors that are responsive to ICB. Our mechanistic studies show that inhibiting TGFβ activity can convert a high βAlt, cold tumor into ICB-responsive tumors via NK cells. A biomarker consisting of combined TGFβ, DNA repair, and immune context signatures is a means to prospectively identify patients whose cancers may be converted from cold to hot with appropriate therapy.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are prototypic cytotoxic innate lymphocytes that can kill target cells, such as tumor cells, in the absence of antigen-restriction. Peripheral NK cells exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity. Here, we set out to broadly assess intrinsic modulators of NK cell degranulation in an unbiased manner. We stimulated human primary blood-borne NK cells pre-treated with different cytokine regimens with the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line and used detection of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1) as an identifier of rapid NK cell degranulation. RNA sequencing of FACS-sorted LAMP1hi NK cells showed CXCR4 and S1PR5 were top down-regulated genes. Using compounds that modulate activity of CXCR4 and S1P receptor family members S1P1 and S1P5, we confirmed they play an important immunosuppressive role in NK cell cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, engagement of CXCR4 and S1P1/5 receptors triggered phosphorylation of p42 and Ca2+ influx. CXCR4 activation promoted S1P5 upregulation and vice versa, and joint activation of both receptors amplified the defect NK cell degranulation. Intriguingly, in tumor samples the expression of both receptors and the synthesis of their ligands themselves appear to be coordinately regulated. Together, these data suggest that specifically and simultaneously targeting CXCR4 and S1P5 activity in the tumor microenvironment (TME) could be a beneficial strategy to unleash full cytotoxic potential of cytotoxic NK effector cells in the tumor.

        <tr id="Humoral immunity is orchestrated by follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which promote cognate B cells to produce high-affinity, protective antibodies. In aged individuals, humoral immunity after vaccination is diminished despite the presence of Tfh cells, suggesting defects after initial Tfh formation. In this study, we utilized both murine and human systems to investigate how aging alters Tfh cell differentiation after influenza vaccination. We found that young Tfh cells underwent progressive differentiation after influenza vaccination, culminating in clonal expansion of effector-like cells in both draining lymph nodes and blood. In aging, early stages of Tfh development occurred normally. However, aging rewired the later stages of development in Tfh cells, resulting in a transcriptional program reflective of cellular senescence, sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and metabolic reprogramming. We investigated the extent to which this rewiring of aged Tfh cells is due to the age-associated inflammatory ("inflammaging") microenvironment and found that this setting was sufficient to both block the transition of Tfh cells to a post-effector resting state and to skew Tfh cells towards the age-rewired state. Together, these data suggest that aging dampens humoral immunity by cytokine-mediated rewiring of late effector Tfh cell differentiation into an activated, yet less functional, cellular state.">

        <tr id="A craniotomy is a neurosurgical procedure performed to access the intracranial space. In 3–5% of cases, infections can develop, most caused by Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation on the skull surface. Medical management of this infection is difficult, as biofilm properties confer immune and antimicrobial recalcitrance to the infection and necessitate additional surgical procedures. Furthermore, treatment failure rates can be appreciably high. These factors, compounded with rapidly expanding rates of antimicrobial resistance, highlight the need to develop alternative treatment strategies to target and reverse the immune dysfunction that occurs during biofilm infection. Our recent work has identified CD4+ Th1 and Th17 cells as potent regulators of innate immune cell activation during craniotomy infection. Here, we report the role of IFN-γ, versus other Th1- and Th17-derived cytokines, in programing the immune response to biofilm infection using both global and cell type-specific IFN-γR1-deficient (Ifngr1−/−) mice. Bacterial burdens were significantly higher in Ifngr1−/− relative to WT animals despite few changes in immune cell abundance. Single-cell transcriptomics identified candidate explanations for this phenotype as alterations in cell death pathways, innate immune cell activation, MHC-II expression, and T cell responses were significantly reduced in Ifngr1−/− mice. While caspase-1 activation in PMNs and macrophage/microglial MHC-II expression were regulated by IFN-γ signaling, no phenotypes were observed with either granulocyte- or macrophage/microglia Ifngr1−/− conditional knockout mice, suggestive of redundancy. Instead, a decreased Th1/Th17 ratio was identified in Ifngr1−/− animals that was corroborated by elevated IL-17 levels and correlated with dysfunctional T cell-innate immune communication. Further, Th17 cells were less effective than Th1 cells in promoting S. aureus bactericidal activity in microglia and macrophages. Collectively, this work identifies a key protective role for IFN-γ during craniotomy infection by enhancing macrophage and microglial antibacterial activity. Therefore, controlled programming of IFN-γ responses may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic craniotomy infections.

        <tr id="Introduction The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, with tumor-associated macrophages significantly influencing immune suppression and tumor growth. Colorectal cancers (CRC) classified as Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) and triple-negative breast cancers subsets are particularly characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype, immune exclusion, and extensive macrophage infiltration. This study aimed to investigate how targeting cancer cell stemness with specific inhibitors could modulate macrophage polarization in CRC in vitro and breast cancer in vivo, potentially shifting the immune balance from pro-tumor M2-like to anti-tumor M1-like macrophages. Methods We used four stemness inhibitors—salinomycin, SB-431542, JIB-04, and napabucasin—each targeting different pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, histone demethylation, and STAT3, respectively), to evaluate their effects on CMS4 CRC cell lines (HCT116 and SW620) and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages in an indirect co-culture model. Results Our results showed that CMS4 CRC cell lines induced distinct macrophage polarization patterns, with HCT116 promoting M2-like macrophages and SW620 leaning toward M1-like profile. Notably, the combination of stemness inhibitors reduced stemness markers (CD133, CD44) in colorectal cancer cells and shifted macrophage polarization toward an M1-like phenotype, particularly in co-culture with HCT116. In vivo studies using the syngeneic immunocompetent EO771 breast cancer mouse model demonstrated that combination of stemness inhibitors increased the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Conclusions Our study highlights the dual potential of stemness inhibitors to target both cancer cells and the immune microenvironment. These findings offer promising strategies for enhancing favorable immunomodulation in mesenchymal-like colorectal tumors.">

        <tr id="Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) encompasses a heterogeneous group of lysosomal storage diseases resulting from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes responsible for the degradation of mucopolysaccharides, also known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Current therapeutic strategies for MPS include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), and symptomatic therapy. This study investigated dynamic changes in MPS type II (MPS-II) through genomic and single-cell sequencing in a patient undergoing ERT. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from one MPS-II patient of 10 year old at different disease stages through scRNA-seq identified various immune cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, NKT cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, CD14 + and CD16 + monocytes, and B cells. Monocytes and macrophages were significantly reduced during the severe stage of MPS-II but increased during the recovery stage following ERT. Notably, monocyte subtype mono3 was exclusively expressed in the severe stage, while mono1_2, a subtype of mono1, was absent during the severe stage and exhibited distinct biological functions. These findings suggest that monocytes and macrophages play critical roles in the pathogenesis of MPS-II and in the response to ERT. Pseudotime, Gene Ontology, and cell-communication analyses revealed unique functions for the different cellular subtypes. Notably, key molecules mediating cellular interactions during ERT in MPS-II included CXCR3, PF4, APP, and C5AR1 in macrophages, RPS19 in T cells, HLA-DPB1 in B cells, ADRB2 in NK cells, and IL1B, C5AR1, RPS19, and TNFSF13B in monocytes. Overall, integrative analysis delineated the expression dynamics of various cell types and identified mutations in MPS-II, providing a comprehensive atlas of transcriptional programs, cellular characterizations, and genomic variation profiles in MPS-II. This dataset, along with advanced integrative analysis, represents a valuable resource for the discovery of drug targets and the improvement of therapeutic strategies for MPS-II.

        <tr id="Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by immune dysregulation that facilitates chronic infection. Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="The absence of signaling pathways related to intrinsic immune activation in tumor cells and the immunosuppressive microenvironment limit lymphocyte infiltration, constitutes an “immune-desert” tumor displaying insensitivity to various immunotherapies. This study investigates strategies to activate intrinsic immune pathways in glioma cells, reverse immunosuppression, and induce tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within the glioma microenvironment (GME) to enhance natural and adaptive immune responses. We successfully induced antigen-presenting cell activation, macrophage/microglia polarization, and TLS formation in GME by intracranial delivery of BafA1@Rexo-SC, which comprises exosomes from irradiated bone marrow-derived stem cells overexpressing CD47 nanobodies and STING, loaded with the autophagy inhibitor BafA1. These exosomes efficiently activated the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to the formation of “lymphoid tissue organizer cells (Lto)” cells, VEGFA release for high endothelial microvessel formation, and chemokine release for T and B cell recruitment. BafA1@Rexo-SC also promoted macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells and enhanced effector T cell function by blocking CD47, while releasing type I interferon. Our findings suggest novel therapeutic approaches for glioma treatment.

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a crucial role in tumor progression and immune regulation. However, the functional heterogeneity of CAFs remains unclear. Here, we identify antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAF), characterized by high MHC II expression, in gastric cancer (GC) tumors and find that apCAFs are preferentially located near tertiary lymphoid structures. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that apCAFs promote T cell activation and enhances its cytotoxic and proliferative capacities, thereby strengthening T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, apCAFs facilitate the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These polarized macrophages, in turn, promote the formation of apCAFs, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies anti-tumor immune responses. Notably, baseline tumors in immunotherapy responders across various cancer types exhibit higher levels of apCAFs infiltration. This study advances the understanding of CAFs heterogeneity in GC and highlights apCAFs as a potential biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in pan-cancer.">

        <tr id="Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is responsible for a wide range of infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. However, the treatment options are limited due to the continuous evolution of drug-resistant and hypervirulent variants. It is crucial to investigate the mechanisms behind the high mortality rate of hypervirulent Kp (hvKp) strains to develop new strategies for preventing hvKp from evading the host’s defenses and improving treatment effectiveness for these fatal infections. In this study, we used a hvKp-induced mouse bacteremia model and performed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the effects of hvKp infection. Our findings demonstrated that hvKp infection led to a decrease in lymphocytes (lymphopenia), attributed to impaired proliferation and apoptosis. The infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the infected lungs was confirmed to suppress T cell proliferation, leading to lymphopenia. We further identified that hvKp promotes tryptophan metabolism in infected lungs, enhancing the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs by inducing the production of the enzyme IDO1. Our ex vivo inhibition experiment revealed that L-kynurenine, a product of tryptophan metabolism, inhibits T-cell proliferation and induces T-cell apoptosis, further suppressing T-cell mediated responses against bacteria. Importantly, when we knocked out the Ido1 gene or inhibited IDO1 expression using a specific inhibitor 1-MT in mice, we observed a significant enhancement in T-cell mediated responses against hvKp. These findings highlight the crucial role of MDSCs in hvKp-induced bacteremia and suggest a promising immunotherapeutic approach by inhibiting IDO1 production to combat infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) including stromal cells that influence resistance to therapy. Recent studies have revealed that stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are heterogeneous in origin, gene expression, and function. Antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), are defined by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression and can activate effector CD4+ T cells that have the potential to contribute to the anti-cancer immune response, but also can induce regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. Whether apCAFs promote or restrain the antitumor response remains uncertain. Using tumor clones of the KPC murine PDAC model differing in sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), we found that immunosensitive (sKPC) tumors were characterized by higher immune cell and apCAF infiltration than resistant (rKPC) tumors. IMC analysis showed proximity of apCAFs and CD4+ T cells in both sKPC and rKPC tumors implicating interaction within the TME. apCAF-depleted sKPC tumor-bearing mice had diminished sensitivity to ICB. apCAFs from both sKPC and rKPC tumors activated tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells and induced Treg differentiation. However, transcriptomic analysis showed that Tregs induced by apCAFs were overexpressed for immunosuppressive genes in rKPCs relative to sKPCs, and that this is associated with differential chemokine signaling from apCAFs depending on tumor origin. Together these data implicate apCAFs as important mediators of the antitumor immune response, modulation of which could facilitate the development of more effective anti-tumor immune based approaches for PDAC patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) substantially limits long-term survival following lung transplantation. To identify potential targets for CLAD prevention, T cells from explanted CLAD lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes, as well as diseased and nondiseased controls were isolated and single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing were performed. TCR sequencing revealed a clonally expanded population of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) with high cytotoxic potential, including upregulation of KLRK1, encoding the co-receptor NKG2D. These cytotoxic CD8+ TRMs accumulated around the CLAD airways and had a 100-fold increase in clonal overlap with lung-draining lymph nodes when compared with non-CLAD lungs. Using a murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation, we confirmed that cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation was due to chronic rejection and not transplantation alone. Furthermore, blocking NKG2D in vivo attenuated the airway remodeling following transplantation and diminished airway accumulation of CD8+ T cells. Our findings support NKG2D as a potential therapeutic target for CLAD, affecting cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor survival rate and limited treatments. Agonistic CD40 antibodies are promising, but clinical trials have shown only modest efficacy and significant hepatotoxicity. We previously reported that IL-1 pathway blockade enhances agonistic CD40 antibody efficacy against melanoma by depleting polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs; CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+). Because PMN-MDSCs also cause liver toxicity, we investigated the impact of IL-1R1 blockade on the efficacy and toxicity of agonistic CD40 antibody therapy in PDAC. Agonistic CD40 antibody therapy induced immune activation and significantly prolonged survival in orthotopic PDAC-bearing mice. IL-1R1 blockade monotherapy downregulated innate and adaptive immune response and exacerbated tumor growth. Although combination therapy upregulated several immune-related pathways and boosted innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-1R1 blockade failed to improve the overall antitumor efficacy of agonistic CD40 antibody therapy and exacerbated liver toxicity. Ly6G+ cell depletion in mice reduced the efficacy of agonistic CD40 antibody therapy, suggesting that Ly6G⁺ immune cells (PMN-MDSCs or neutrophils) exhibit an antitumor rather than immunosuppressive role in PDAC. Our findings underscore the complex role of IL-1 signaling in modulating immune responses in PDAC and caution against pursuing IL-1R1 blockade, either as monotherapy or combined with agonistic CD40 antibodies, in clinical trials for PDAC.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, recently approved by the FDA for melanoma, is an emerging modality for cell-based immunotherapy. However, its application in immunologically “cold” tumors such as glioblastoma remains limited due to sparse T cell infiltration, antigenic heterogeneity, and a suppressive tumor microenvironment. To identify genomic and spatial determinants of TIL expandability, we performed integrated, multimodal profiling of high-grade gliomas using spectral flow cytometry, TCR sequencing, single-cell RNA-seq, Xenium in situ transcriptomics, and CODEX spatial proteomics. Comparative analysis of TIL-generating (TIL⁺) versus non-generating (TIL⁻) tumors revealed that IL7R expression, structured perivascular immune clustering, and tumor-intrinsic metabolic programs such as ACSS3 were associated with successful TIL expansion. In contrast, TIL⁻ tumors were enriched for neuronal lineage signatures, immunosuppressive transcripts including TOX and FERMT1, and tumor-connected macrophages. This study defines spatial and molecular correlates of TIL manufacturing success and establishes a genomics-enabled selection platform for adoptive T cell therapy. The profiling approach is now being prospectively implemented in the GIANT clinical trial (NCT06816927), supporting its translational relevance and scalability across glioblastoma and other immune-excluded cancers.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia remains a major contributor to clinical complications in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, including organ injury, morbidity and mortality. Given their critical role in antiviral defense, CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against CMV. Methods Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional signatures and developmental lineages of CD8+ T cells in eight immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received organs from CMV-seropositive donors. Results were validated in a cohort of 62 KTRs using immunophenotyping. Results Our data revealed a significant influence of CMV serostatus on transcriptional variance of CD8+ memory T cells, associating with the first principal component from a global analysis of CD8+ T cells (p =0.0406), forming a continuum with five principal differentiation trajectories driven by CMV primary infection or reactivation. Following CMV primary infection, CD8+ T cells were hallmarked by restrained effector-memory differentiation. CD8+ T cells during CMV reactivation diverged non-linearly into senescent-like cells with signatures of arrested cell cycle, diminished translational activity and downregulated ZNF683 and longitudinally expanding effector cells with robust cytotoxic potential and upregulated ZNF683, acting as a reservoir for long-lived effector cells supporting long-term protection. Notably, CD28lo KLRG1hi IL-7R (CD127)lo HLA-DRhi CD8+ T cells present prior to the detection of viremia in CMV-seropositive patients emerged as a key feature distinguishing patients who did or did not undergo CMV reactivation after prophylaxis discontinuation (p =0.0163). Frequencies of these cells were also positively correlated with CMV-stimulated secretion of IFN-γ (p =0.0494), TNF-α (p =0.0358), MIP-1α (p =0.0262), MIP-1β (p =0.0043). Discussion These results provide insights into the transcriptional regulation that influences the generation of CD8+ T cell immunity to CMV and may inform strategics for monitoring host immune response to CMV to better identify and introduce therapeutic intervention to patients at risk of developing clinically significant CMV viremia.">

By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2−/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor.

        <tr id="Immune evasion by cancer cells involves reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) via communication with non-malignant cells. However, resistance-promoting interactions during treatment remain lesser known. Here we examine the composition, communication, and phenotypes of tumor-associated cells in serial biopsies from stage II and III high-risk estrogen receptor positive (ER+ ) breast cancers of patients receiving endocrine therapy (letrozole) as single agent or in combination with ribociclib, a CDK4/6-targeting cell cycle inhibitor. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on longitudinally collected samples show that in tumors overcoming the growth suppressive effects of ribociclib, first cancer cells upregulate cytokines and growth factors that stimulate immune-suppressive myeloid differentiation, resulting in reduced myeloid cell- CD8 + T-cell crosstalk via IL-15/18 signaling. Subsequently, tumors growing during treatment show diminished T-cell activation and recruitment. In vitro, ribociclib does not only inhibit cancer cell growth but also T cell proliferation and activation upon co-culturing. Exogenous IL-15 improves CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy by augmenting T-cell proliferation and cancer cell killing by T cells. In summary, response to ribociclib in stage II and III high-risk ER +  breast cancer depends on the composition, activation phenotypes and communication network of immune cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective: Chronic HBV infection disproportionately affects people living with HIV, who are often excluded from functional cure studies. This study investigates CD8+ T cell profiles in HBV mono-infection versus HBV/HIV co-infection, examining the impact of long-term therapy on virus-specific responses with the goal of informing therapeutic strategies for immune restoration. Design: We analysed CD8+ T cell responses in 61 participants (HBV n=20, HBV/HIV n=20, HIV n=21), on suppressive antiviral therapy. We assessed transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, focusing on exhaustion markers alongside virus-specific functional capabilities. Results: Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct signature in co-infection, with upregulation of genes associated with TCR signaling, inhibitory pathways and progenitor-exhausted markers (XCL2, TCF7, PDCD1, IL7R). This gene profile scored highly for a precursor exhausted (Tpex) CD8+ T cell signature, reflecting a "stemness" programme that maintains plasticity despite chronic antigen exposure. Proteomic analysis confirmed higher frequencies of precursor exhausted TCF-1+CD127+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in co-infection, while HBV mono-infection showed predominance of terminally exhausted ToxhighTCF-1-CD127- cells. These differences correlated with more robust, polyfunctional HBV-specific responses in co-infection against surface and core antigens. Lower HBsAg levels and longer treatment duration in co-infection associated positively with Tpex populations and functional responses and inversely with terminal exhaustion. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that individuals with well-controlled HBV/HIV co-infection maintain more robust CD8+ T cell responses with preserved stem-like properties supporting ongoing antiviral function. These results underscore the benefits of early antiretroviral intervention and the need for tailored immune-modulatory therapies to restore antiviral functionality in these diverse patient populations.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease most frequently caused by autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) located at the neuromuscular junction. Thymic follicular hyperplasia is present in most of the patients with early-onset AChR-Ab+ MG (EOMG), but its cellular and molecular drivers and development remain poorly understood. Methods We constructed a single cell-based transcriptional profile of lymphoid cell types in thymi from 11 immunotherapy-naïve patients with EOMG. Multiplex histology and ELISA were used to determine migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels. Results Within EOMG thymi, we consistently observed 6 distinct clusters of B-cell populations maturing toward germinal center (GC)–associated and Ab-secreting cells, featuring prominent GC activity, as indicated by substantial clonal expansions and cycling B-cell subsets. Cell-cell interactome predictions identified strong interactions between T cells and GC-associated and memory B cells, dominated by B-cell prosurvival signaling through the MIF-CD74 axis. Multiplex histology confirmed abundant expression of CD74 in MG thymic B cells. Circulating MIF levels in EOMG correlated with higher disease severity as assessed by Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America status. Discussion Our data not only illustrate and define hyperplastic thymic niches in MG as favorable environments for pathogenic B-cell proliferation, maturation, and persistence but also suggest that the MIF-CD74 axis should be investigated for potential novel therapeutic targeting in EOMG.">

        <tr id="Background Since the emergence of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, the disease has led to widespread acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), who are at increased risk due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. This study aims to explore the differences in immune responses between kidney transplant recipients and non-kidney transplant recipients in COVID-19-induced ARDS to identify potential therapeutic targets for improving outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 108,320 cells derived from peripheral blood samples to construct a global single-cell map of COVID-19 induced ARDS in kidney transplant recipients(ARDSKT), COVID-19 induced ARDS in non transplant recipients(ARDSNKT), and healthy controls. Subsequently, using cellular clustering analysis, we obtained single-cell maps of different cell types. We employed enrichment analysis to determine the pathways involved in different subpopulations and focused on the role of key immune cells such as monocytes, megakaryocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Significant immune differences were observed between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT. In ARDSKT, the S100A9+ MK subpopulation, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, was elevated, promoting inflammation. In contrast, the S100A12+ monocyte subpopulation that activates the chemokine signaling pathway was more abundant in ARDSNKT, reflecting a stronger inflammatory response, while its abundance was reduced in ARDSKT due to immunosuppression. The CXCR4+ B subpopulation, crucial for adaptive immunity, was significantly reduced in ARDSKT. Additionally, the XAF1+ Teff subpopulation, associated with apoptosis, was more abundant in ARDSKT, potentially impairing immune recovery. This study highlights the immune differences between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT, revealing the impact of immunosuppression on immune dysregulation. These findings suggest that targeting specific immune pathways can improve therapeutic strategies for ARDSKT.

        <tr id="Cancer-associated myeloid cells due to their plasticity play dual roles in both promoting and inhibiting tumor progression. Myeloid cells with immunosuppressive properties play a critical role in anti-cancer immune regulation. Cells of different origin, such as tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor associated neutrophils (TANs), myeloid derived suppressor cells (also called MDSCs) and eosinophils are often expanded in cancer patients and significantly influence their survival, but also the outcome of anti-cancer therapies. For this reason, the variety of preclinical and clinical studies to modulate the activity of these cells have been conducted, however without successful outcome to date. In this review, pro-tumor activity of myeloid cells, myeloid cell-specific therapeutic targets, in vivo studies on myeloid cell re-polarization and the impact of myeloid cells on immunotherapies/genetic engineering are addressed. This paper also summarizes ongoing clinical trials and the concept of chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) therapies, and suggests future research perspectives, offering new opportunities in the development of novel clinical treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a unique subset of innate-like T lymphocytes that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. Characterized by their semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) and abundant localization in mucosal tissues, MAIT cells recognize microbial metabolites, primarily derived from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein 1 (MR1). This interaction, along with co-stimulatory signals, triggers rapid immune responses, including cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity, highlighting their importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and combating infections. This review provides an in-depth overview of MAIT cell biology, including development, activation pathways, and functional diversity, highlighting their protective roles in immunity, contributions to diseases like cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and context-dependent dual functions in health and pathology. This review also highlights the emerging therapeutic potential of MAIT cells in immunotherapy. Their unique TCR specificity, abundance, and tissue-homing properties make them ideal candidates for engineering novel therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-MAIT cells, targeting infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases. Challenges like antigen escape, T cell exhaustion, and CAR design optimization must be addressed to enhance clinical efficacy. In summary, MAIT cells are integral to immune function, and their therapeutic potential presents exciting opportunities for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Further research is essential to unlock the full potential of these versatile immune cells.">

        <tr id="Coeliac Disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting 0.5-1% of the general population with a wide geographical distribution. Despite recent efforts to deeply phenotype gluten-specific immune activation at the single cell level, recent clinical studies targeting gluten degradation and other immune tolerance mechanisms have been unsuccessful. To this end, a deeper understanding of immune and non-immune cellular dynamics and interactions are required to characterize tissue-specific mechanisms responsible for CeD pathogenesis, repair, and resolution. Here, we assembled the most comprehensive scRNAseq dataset in Coeliac Disease to date, including 203,555 cells across 21 active CeD and 11 control duodenal samples. Compared to control duodenum, CeD was characterized by single cell differential changes in abundance, gene expression and cell-cell interactions across cellular compartments. In the immune compartments, CeD samples showed expected increases in plasma cell abundance and shifts toward type 1 effector biology (e.g., increase in cycling CD8pos, γδ T cells and IFNG transcriptional shifts) and Tfh-related biology (e.g., increases in IL21 signaling to effector T cells). In addition, activated myeloid subsets, including DC2 and monocytes, were increased in disease and were characterized by increased pro-inflammatory pathway expression, including IL-1β. Non-immune compartments showed increased stem/crypt and secretory enterocytes in CeD samples with a decrease in absorptive enterocytes, reflecting the villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia hallmarks of CeD epithelial dysfunction. Accompanying the epithelial changes, distinct changes in stromal populations were identified, particularly with increases in abundance and transcriptional activity of NRG1 and SMOC2 fibroblasts. Cell-cell interaction analysis across multiple cellular compartments proposed a distinct increased role of fibroblasts to support the epithelial reprogramming of the increased stem/crypt epithelial fraction in CeD, mediated by myeloid derived IL-1β signal and lymphoid-derived IFN-γ. This dataset reveals a previously unknown role for T-myeloid-stromal-epithelial cell communication in CeD, highlighting key mechanisms of the tissue-level cellular dynamics in response to gluten ingestion.">

        <tr id="Overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report that IL-16 administration enhances the polarization of T helper 1 (Th1) cells by inhibiting glutamine catabolism through the downregulation of glutaminase in CD4+ T cells and increases the production of Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ, thus improving anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.">

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alterations of the adaptive immune system have been shown to impact bone healing and may result in impaired healing in some patients. Apart from T cells, B cells are the key drivers of adaptive immunity. Therefore, their role in age-associated impairments of bone healing might be essential to understand delays during the healing process. B cells are essential for bone formation, and their dysfunction has been associated with aging or autoimmune diseases. But whether age-associated changes in B cell phenotypes are involved in bone regeneration is unknown. Methods Here, we aimed to characterize the role of immune aging in B cell phenotypes during the early inflammatory phase of bone healing. By comparing non-immune experienced with young and immune experienced mice we aimed to analyze the effect of gained immune experience on B cells. Our single cell proteo-genomics analysis quantified thousands of transcriptomes of cells that were isolated from post osteotomy hematoma and the proximal and distal bone marrow cavities, and enabled us to evaluate cell proportion, differential gene expression and cell trajectories. Results While the B cell proportion in young and non-immune experienced animals did not significantly change from 2 to 5 days post osteotomy in the hematoma, we found a significant decrease of the B cell proportion in the immune experienced mice, which was accompanied by the decreased expression of B cell specific genes, suggesting a specific response in immune experienced animals. Furthermore, we detected the most extensive B cell differentiation block in immune-experienced mice compared to non-immune experienced and young animals, predominantly in the transition from immature to mature B cells. Discussion Our results suggest that the pronounced impairment of B cell production found in immune experienced animals plays an important role in the initial phase leading to delayed bone healing. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches may be able target the B cell differentiation defect to retain B cell functionality even in the immune experienced setting, which is prone to delayed healing.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="The role of mesenchymal cells during respiratory infection is not well defined, including whether, which, and how the different types of mesenchymal cells respond. We collected all mesenchymal cells from lung single-cell suspensions of mice that were naive (after receiving only saline vehicle), pneumonic (after intratracheal instillation of pneumococcus 24 hours previously), or resolved from infection (after nonlethal pneumococcal infections 6 weeks previously) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing. Cells clustered into 5 well-separated groups based on their transcriptomes: matrix fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and mesothelial cells. Fibroblasts were the most abundant and could be further segregated into Pdgfra+Npnt+Ces1d+Col13a1+ alveolar fibroblasts and Cd9+Pi16+Sca1+Col14a1+ adventitial fibroblasts. The cells from naive and resolved groups overlapped in dimension reduction plots, suggesting the mesenchymal cells returned to baseline transcriptomes after resolution. During pneumonia, all mesenchymal cells responded with altered transcriptomes, revealing a core response that had been conserved across cell types as well as distinct mesenchymal cell type–specific responses. The different subsets of fibroblasts induced similar gene sets, but the alveolar fibroblasts responded more strongly than the adventitial fibroblasts. These data demonstrated diverse and specialized immune activities of lung mesenchymal cells during pneumonia.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Hepatoblastoma (HB) is a common paediatric liver malignancy characterised by significant intratumoral heterogeneity and a complex tumour microenvironment (TME). Using single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), we analysed 43,592 cells from three tumour regions and adjacent normal tissue of an HB patient. Our study revealed distinct cellular compositions and varying degrees of malignancy across different tumour regions, with the T1 region showing the highest malignancy and overexpression of HMGB2 and TOP2A. Survival analysis demonstrated that high HMGB2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased recurrence, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Additionally, we identified a diverse immune microenvironment enriched with regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD8+ effector memory T cells (Tem), indicating potential immune evasion mechanisms. Notably, CTLA‐4 and PD‐1 were highly expressed in Tregs and Tem cells, highlighting their potential as immunotherapy targets. Myeloid cells, including Kupffer cells and dendritic cells, also exhibited distinct functional roles in different tumour regions. This study provides the first comprehensive single‐cell atlas of HB, revealing critical insights into its intratumoral heterogeneity and immune microenvironment. Our findings not only advance the understanding of HB biology but also offer new directions for precision medicine, including the development of targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Tumor dissemination is a key event in tumor progression. During this event, a main role is played by circulating tumor cells (CTCs), immune cells, and their interaction. How the immune system supports the survival and proliferation of CTCs is not fully elucidated. In this study we established an in-vitro co-culture system consisting of immune cells and CTCs from the same patient, which increased the success rate in the establishment of CTC-derived long-term cell cultures. In this system, we characterized the immune cells of successful co-cultures and the signals they exchange with cancer cells, including cytokines and extracellular vesicle (EV) content. Using this protocol, we stabilized four CTC-derived cell lines from patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer, which were cultured for over a year and characterized from a genetic and molecular point of view. The four cell lines harbor shared chromosomal aberrations including the amplification at 8q24.21 containing MYC and deletion 9p21.3 containing CDKN2A/B and the IFN type I cluster. The transcriptomic profile of CTC cell lines is distinct from primary tumors, and we detected the activation of E2F, G2M and MYC pathways and the downregulation of interferon response pathway. Each cell line shows a degree of invasiveness in zebrafish in-vivo, and the most invasive ones share the same mutation in RAB14 gene. In addition, the four cell lines secrete cell-line specific EVs containing microRNAs that target YAP, BRG1-AKT1, TCF8-HDAC pathways. Overall, we highlight how the immune system plays a key role in the proliferation of CTCs through EV signaling, and how CTC cell line genomic and transcriptomic alterations make these cells less visible from the immune system and likely responsible for the survival advantage in sites distant from the microenvironment of origin.">

Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt)-expressing APCs are heterogenous regulators of T cell tolerance but their subtypes and lineage relationships are ill-defined. We report that RORγt+ dendritic cells (DCs) are evolutionarily conserved, exhibit wide tissue distribution and reconcile various RORγt+ APC populations known to promote peripheral T cell tolerance. We show that RORγt+ DCs can sense pathogens, migrate to lymph nodes, activate naïve CD4+ T cells, and accumulate in demyelinating neuroinflammation with a proinflammatory phenotype. Thus, RORγt+ DCs have a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment.

In a human to mouse reverse-engineering approach, a single amino acid substitution adjacent to the C-terminal proline-rich domain created CD28A210P mice with enhanced signaling. CD28A210P mice experienced pro-inflammatory responses to CD28 superagonist antibody, analogous to severe cytokine storm induced in a human clinical trial, with a striking increase of activated CD8 T cells. In acute and chronic viral infections, early activation and expansion of CD28A210P CD8 effector T cells increased, with accelerated exhaustion in chronic infection. Mechanistically, CD28A210P enhanced JunB, IL-2, and inhibitory receptors driven by MEK1/2. Generation of CD28A210P stem-like progenitor (Tpex) cells was enhanced in acute and chronic infections, and further expanded by PD-L1 blockade in chronically-infected mice.

        <tr id="A primary obstacle for HIV elimination is the long-term viral reservoir in lymphoid tissues (LT) that can cause rebound viremia if therapy is stopped. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are critical for control of HIV and SIV viremia; however, CD8+ T cells that migrate to LT are primarily non-cytotoxic, calling into question whether these cells could reduce the viral reservoir on ART or control viral replication when therapy is halted. To determine if CD8+ T cells can inhibit viral replication when retained in lymphoid tissues, we inhibited lymphocyte egress from LTs in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RM) during analytic treatment interruption (ATI) using the S1PR modulator FTY720 alone or in combination with anti-PD1 and the IL-15 receptor superagonist N-803 to increase cytolytic function. FTY720 retained migrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in LT, whereas cytotoxic CD8+ T cells remained in the vasculature. After ATI and viral rebound, activated SIV-specific CD8+ T cells increased in frequency in LT of FTY720-treated RM but failed to become cytotoxic or control plasma viremia compared to controls, even when combined with anti-PD1 and N-803. These findings indicate that LT-localized CD8+ T cells alone are insufficient to delay or prevent plasma viral rebound during ATI. Significance Statement HIV therapeutic and cure strategies have all operated under the assumption that CD8+ T cells can become cytotoxic in lymph nodes to eliminate infected cells from reservoir repositories. Using FTY720 to prevent lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, we demonstrated that lymphoid tissue-restricted CD8+ T cells are insufficient to prevent SIV rebound during antiretroviral treatment interruption, even in the presence of immunomodulators such as IL-15 receptor superagonist and PD-1 blockade. These findings call into question the ability of lymph node CD8+ T cells to control or eliminate SIV/HIV infection from lymphoid tissues without substantial immunomodulation, a notion contrary to current efforts to engage CD8+ T cells for therapeutic elimination of HIV viral reservoirs during ART.">

        <tr id="Although immune therapy has seen significant advances, the majority of breast and other solid tumors do not respond or quickly develop de novo resistance. One factor driving resistance is highly immune suppressive myeloid cells (MCs) such as macrophages. Previous work has established clinical links between cholesterol and cancer outcome, and that MC function can be regulated through disruption in cholesterol metabolism. Thus, we screened for proteins that were expressed in MCs, involved in cholesterol homeostasis and whose expression was associated with survival; we identify the cholesterol efflux protein ABCA1. Preclinical studies revealed that ABCA1 activity resulted in increased anti-cancer functions of macrophages: enhanced tumor infiltration, decreased angiogenic potential, reduced efferocytosis, and improved support of CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, different AKT isoforms are involved, through both PI3K dependent and independent mechanisms. Assessment of human blood and breast tumors revealed correlations between ABCA1 in macrophages and angiogenic potential, VEGFA, and CD8 T cell abundance and activity, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. The culmination of the effects of ABCA1 on MC function were demonstrated through increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice with MC specific knockout of ABCA1. Therefore, modulating ABCA1 activity within MCs may represent a novel approach to immune therapy.">

Although CD4 T-cells are key immune effectors to control TB, early after infection, the innate immune response must play a role in tackling the disease. Here, we performed in-depth analyses of the acute immune response to MTBVAC, a candidate vaccine engineered from Mtb with the aim of protecting adults from pulmonary TB disease, still a major global challenge. scRNA-seq shows expansion of CD4+ and cytotoxic γδ T-cells, data confirmed by flow cytometry. CD4 T-cells exhibited lower HLA-DR and higher L-selectin expression, compared to BCG-stimulation, indicating differential activation or dynamics. Importantly, MTBVAC-activated γδ T-cells had a unique cytotoxic CD16+GZMB+ phenotype, reminiscent of effector cells found in Mtb positive individuals controlling infection. IFN-γ and TNF-α were released in cultures, while IL-17A/F were almost undetectable.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cytotoxic immune cell populations, including CD8+ T cells, play a critical role in anti-tumor immunity, suppressing tumor progression. For this reason, recent therapeutic algorithms include immunotherapeutic agents that target such cell populations for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors. In contrast to solid tumors, such immunotherapeutic strategies failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this reason, the study of immunophenotypic and molecular changes in cytotoxic effector cell populations in patients with such disorders would provide the necessary evidence for the development of novel immunotherapies. In this review, we provide an overview of experimental studies describing the modulation of CD8+ T cell populations in patients with myeloid neoplasms, focusing on whether and how specific cell phenotypes are linked to disease progression and treatment.">

        <tr id="Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment for aggressive hematologic malignancies. However, the risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a significant barrier to allo-HSCT. GVHD is a debilitating condition with high mortality rates and current therapeutic options for GVHD are limited, with corticosteroids being the standard treatment. However, the adverse effects of steroids make prolonged use difficult, necessitating the development of safer therapies. IL-35-producing B-cells (i35-Bregs) have emerged as critical regulators of immunity during autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated whether i35-Bregs immunotherapy can suppress and mitigate GVHD. Methods: We administered a single dose of i35-Bregs (1.5×106) to mice undergoing allo-HSCT and monitored disease severity and survival of GVHD mice over 90 days post-transplantation. We discovered that i35-Bregs secrete exosomes containing membrane-bound IL-35 (i35-Exosomes) and investigated whether ex-vivo generated i35-exosomes can be used as stand-alone immunotherapy for GVHD. i35-Breg-induced expression of cytokines or checkpoint proteins (PD-1, LAG-3, CTLA-4) was analyzed by Flow cytometry, ELISA, and RNA-seq analysis. Characterization of membrane-bound IL-35 was by Proximity ligation assay (PLA), immunohistochemistry/Confocal microscopy and Alpha Fold-Multimer modeling. Results: A single dose of 1.5×106 i35-Breg reduced severity of GVHD and prolonged GVHD survival, with more than 70% i35-Breg-treated mice surviving beyond day-90 post-transplantation while observing 100% mortality among untreated mice by day-45. Contrary to the view that IL-35 is secreted cytokine, we show here that i35-Bregs mitigate GVHD via membrane-bound IL-35 and by secreting i35-exosomes. Furthermore, i35-Bregs or ex-vivo generated i35-exosomes induce alloreactive T-cells to upregulate checkpoint proteins associated with T-cell exhaustion and anergy, inhibiting alloreactive responses and propagating infectious-tolerance mechanisms that suppress GVHD. Importantly, i35-Bregs or i35-exosomes suppresses GVHD by increasing bystander lymphocytes coated with immunosuppressive i35-exosomes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that i35-Bregs and i35-exosomes play a critical role in mitigating GVHD. The combination of i35-Breg and i35-exosome immunotherapy may be an effective strategy for treating GVHD and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, LAG-3, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CXCL13, and LAYN was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients’ survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Invariant Natural Killer T (NKT) cells represent a unique subset of innate-like T cells that express both NK cell and T cell receptors. These cells are rapidly activated by glycolipid antigens presented via CD1d molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages, or through cytokine-dependent mechanisms. Their ability to produce a wide range of cytokines and express costimulatory molecules underscores their critical role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. B cells, traditionally recognized for their role in antibody production, also act as potent APCs due to their high expression of CD1d, enabling direct interactions with iNKT cells. This interaction has significant implications for humoral immunity, influencing B cell activation, class-switch recombination (CSR), germinal center formation, and memory B cell differentiation, thus expanding the conventional paradigm of T cell–B cell interactions. While the influence of iNKT cells on B cell biology and humoral responses is well-supported, many aspects of their interaction remain unresolved. Key questions include the roles of different iNKT cell subsets, the diversity of APCs, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these interactions, especially during early activation, and the potential for distinct glycolipid ligands to modulate immune outcomes. Understanding these factors could provide valuable insights into how iNKT cells regulate B cell-mediated immunity and offer opportunities to harness these interactions in immunotherapeutic applications, such as vaccine development. In this review, we examine these unresolved aspects and propose a novel perspective on the regulatory potential of iNKT cells in humoral immunity, emphasizing their promise as a target for innovative vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="B cells are essential components of the immune response, primarily recognized for their ability to produce antibodies. However, emerging research reveals their important roles in regulating immune responses and influencing tumor development, independent of antibodies. The connection between tumor progression and alterations in the tumor microenvironment is well-established, as immune infiltrating cells can enhance the survival of tumor cells by modifying their surroundings. Despite this, the majority of studies have focused on T cells and macrophages, creating a gap in our understanding of B cells. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) represent a crucial subpopulation that plays a significant role in maintaining immune balance. They may have a substantial impact on tumor immunity by negatively regulating tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This paper reviews the existing literature on Bregs, examining their development, phenotypes, functions, and the mechanisms through which they exert their regulatory effects. Furthermore, we highlight their potential interventional roles and prognostic significance in cancer therapy. By addressing the current gaps in knowledge regarding Bregs within tumors, we hope to inspire further research that could lead to innovative cancer treatments and improved outcomes for patients.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

        <tr id="Regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a key homeostatic regulator of immune cells, has been implicated in multiple diseases associated with aging and chronic inflammation including Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Interestingly, subjects with idiopathic PD display reduced levels of RGS10 in subsets of peripheral immune cells. Additionally, individuals with PD have been shown to have increased activated peripheral immune cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to age-matched healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether peripheral immune cells in the CSF of individuals with PD also exhibit decreased levels of RGS10. Utilizing the Michael J. Fox Foundation Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study we found that RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF of individuals with PD compared to healthy controls and prodromal individuals. As RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF and circulating peripheral immune cells of individuals with PD, we hypothesized that RGS10 regulates peripheral immune cell responses to chronic systemic inflammation (CSI) prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. To test this, we induced CSI for 6 weeks in C57BL6/J mice and RGS10 KO mice to assess circulating and CNS-associated immune cell responses. We found that RGS10 deficiency synergizes with CSI to induce a bias for inflammatory and cytotoxic cell populations, a reduction in antigen presentation machinery in peripheral blood immune cells, as well as in and around the brain that is most notable in males. These results highlight RGS10 as an important regulator of the systemic immune response to CSI and implicate RGS10 as a potential contributor to the development of immune dysregulation in PD.

        <tr id="Abstract Persistent systemic inflammation is associated with an elevated risk of cardiometabolic diseases. However, the characteristics of the innate and adaptive immune systems in individuals who develop these conditions remain poorly defined. Doublets, or cell-cell complexes, are routinely eliminated from flow cytometric and other immune phenotyping analyses, which limits our understanding of their relationship to disease states. Using well-characterized clinical cohorts, including participants with controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a model for chronic inflammation and increased immune cell interactions, we show that circulating CD14+ monocytes complexed to CD3+ T cells are dynamic, biologically relevant, and increased in individuals with diabetes after adjusting for confounding factors. The complexes form functional immune synapses with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and greater glucose utilization. Furthermore, in persons with HIV, the CD3+ T cell: CD14+ monocyte complexes had more HIV copies compared to matched CD14+ monocytes or CD4+ T cells alone. Our results demonstrate that circulating CD3+ T-cell: CD14+ monocyte pairs represent dynamic cellular interactions that may contribute to inflammation and cardiometabolic disease pathogenesis. CD3+ T-cell: CD14+ monocyte complexes may originate or be maintained, in part, by chronic viral infections. These findings provide a foundation for future studies investigating mechanisms linking T cell-monocyte cell-cell complexes to developing immune-mediated diseases, including HIV and diabetes.">

        <tr id="Neuroblastoma (NB) is an immunologically “cold” tumor with poor or no inflamed substrates as most of solid pediatric tumors (SPT). Consistent data indicate that NB tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by myeloid cells, with little (but variable) T cell infiltration. The obstacles to lymphocyte infiltration and to their anti-tumor activity are due to different tumor immune evasion strategies, including loss of HLA Class I molecules, high expression of immune checkpoint molecular ligands leading to exhaustion of T effector (and NK) cells, induction of T regulatory, myeloid and stromal cells and secretion of immunosuppressive mediators. In odds with adult solid tumors, NB displays weak immunogenicity caused by intrinsic low mutational burden and scant expression of neoepitopes in the context of MHC-class I antigens which, in turn, are particularly poorly expressed on NB cells, thus inducing low anti-tumor T cell responses. In addition, NB is generated from embryonal cells and is the result of transcriptional abnormalities and not of the accumulation of genetic mutations over time, thus further explaining the low immunogenicity. The poor expression of immunogenic molecules on tumor cells is associated with the high production of immunosuppressive factors which further downregulate lymphocyte infiltration and activity, thus explaining the limited efficacy of new drugs in NB, as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review is focused on examining the role of T effector and regulatory cells infiltrating TME of NB, taking into account their repertoire, phenotype, function, plasticity and, importantly, predictive value for defining novel targets for therapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Efficient tumor T-cell infiltration is crucial for the effectiveness of T-cell-based therapies against solid tumors. Eosinophils play crucial roles in recruiting T cells in solid tumors. Our group has previously generated induced eosinophils (iEOs) from human pluripotent stem cells and exhibited synergistic efficacy with CAR-T cells in solid tumor inhibition. However, administrated eosinophils might influx into inflammatory lungs, posing a potential safety risk. Mitigating the safety concern and enhancing efficacy is a promising development direction for further application of eosinophils.


METHODS
We developed a new approach to generate eosinophils with enhanced potency from human chemically reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (hCiPSCs) with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 signaling agonist R848.


RESULTS
R848-activated iEOs (R-iEOs) showed significantly decreased influx to the inflamed lungs, indicating a lower risk of causing airway disorders. Furthermore, these R-iEOs had enhanced anti-tumor functions, preferably accumulated at tumor sites, and further increased T-cell infiltration. The combination of R-iEOs and CAR-T cells suppressed tumor growth in mice. Moreover, the chemo-trafficking signaling increased in R-iEOs, which may contribute to the decreased lung influx of R-iEOs and the increased tumor recruitment of T cells.


CONCLUSION
Our study provides a novel approach to alleviate the potential safety concerns associated with eosinophils while increasing T-cell infiltration in solid tumors. This finding offers a prospective strategy for incorporating eosinophils to improve CAR-T-cell immunotherapy for solid tumors in the future.">

        <tr id="In the last two decades, novel and promising cell-based therapies have populated the treatment landscape for haematological tumors. However, commonly exploited T and NK cell-based therapies show limited applicability to solid tumors. This is mainly given by the impaired tumor trafficking capability and limited effector activity of these cells within a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Myeloid cells spontaneously home to tumors and can thus be reprogrammed and/or engineered to directly attack tumor cells or locally and selectively deliver therapeutically relevant payloads that may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against difficult-to-access solid tumors. In the context of myeloid cell-based therapies, adoptive transfer of monocytes has often been overshadowed by infusion of differentiated macrophages or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite their promising therapeutic potential. Here, we summarize the recent improvements and benefits of using monocytes for the treatment of solid tumors, their current clinical applications and the challenges of their use as well as some possible strategies to overcome them.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (Mφ) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective Mφ depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by Mφ in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood. Methods The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of Mφ was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay. Results ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by Mφ. Mφ depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy. Conclusions Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving Mφ reprogramming rather than their depletion.">

Mechanistically, HLH / MAS are driven by persistent activation of lymphoid and myeloid cells, but our understanding of the pathogenic cell populations remains incomplete. Main body In this Perspectives article, we provide an overview of the biology of HLH / MAS and the critical role of interferon-g in disease pathogenesis. We discuss the recent discovery of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS marked by expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, which are primary producers of IFN-γ. The expansion of cycling lymphocytes correlates with disease activity and helps to distinguish HLH / MAS from clinical mimics. We demonstrate an approach to quantify CD38+HLA-DR+ cycling lymphocytes and evaluate their utility as a diagnostic biomarker for HLH / MAS. Lastly, we discuss the treatment of MAS, including potential therapeutic options to target these pathogenic lymphocytes. Conclusion Understanding of biology of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to overcome these fatal hyperinflammatory disorders.">

Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model.

 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical treatment for hematologic disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and specific immune deficiencies. Despite its efficacy, challenges such as engraftment failure and delayed neutrophil regeneration remain significant barriers. These complications lead to prolonged cytopenia, increased risks of infections and other complications, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to play essential roles in supporting hematopoiesis, the precise mechanisms and interactions between MSCs and other cellular components in HSCT require further investigation. Methods To address these challenges, we explored the combined infusion of allotype-cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and activated T cells from the same donor along with third-party MSCs. The study assessed the effects of this triple-cell therapy on neutrophil differentiation and function ex vivo and in vivo. Using a respiratory infection model, we evaluated the accumulation of human neutrophils, cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IL-8), bacterial clearance, and overall survival compared to control groups. Results The triple-cell therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the differentiation of human HSCs into neutrophils both in ex vivo and in vivo. In the respiratory infection model, this approach resulted in enhanced accumulation of human neutrophils, increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, superior bacterial clearance, and reduced mortality rates compared to the control group. These findings highlight the synergistic interplay between allo-HSCs, MSCs, and activated T cells in promoting neutrophil production and function. Conclusions Our study presents a novel therapeutic strategy combining allo-HSCs, activated T cells, and third-party MSCs to enhance neutrophil production and functionality post-transplantation. This approach not only accelerates neutrophil regeneration but also improves resistance to infections, offering a promising avenue to overcome engraftment challenges in HSCT.">

        <tr id="Introduction Hematogenous disseminated tuberculosis (DTB) has an unclear etiology that likely involves multiple factors. Understanding the underlying immunological characteristics of DTB is crucial for elucidating its pathogenesis. Methods We conducted single-cell RNA transcriptome and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on samples from seven DTB patients. Additionally, we integrated and analyzed data from two published profiles of latent TB infection, three active TB cases, and two healthy controls. Results Our analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of inflammatory immune cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) in DTB patients, along with a notably lower abundance of various lymphocytes (including T cells, B cells, and plasma cells), suggesting that lymphopenia is a prominent feature of the disease. T cell pseudotime analysis indicated a decrease in the expression of most hypervariable genes over time, pointing to T cell functional exhaustion. Furthermore, a marked absence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells was observed in the peripheral blood of DTB patients. In the TCR repertoire, specific polymorphisms (TRAV9-2, TRAV13-1, TRBV20-1, and TRBV5-1) and dominant clones (TRAJ49, TRBJ2-7, and TRBJ2-1) were identified. Analysis of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) showed that the most frequent combination was TRAV1-2/TRAJ33, with the motif “CAAMD” being significantly reduced in DTB patients. Discussion These findings suggest that lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion, along with unique TCR signatures, may play critical roles in DTB pathogenesis. The reduced “CAAMD” motif and altered TCR clonotypes provide novel insights into the complex cellular dynamics associated with the disease, potentially offering new avenues for targeted immunological interventions.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="Introduction The immunological profiles of CD4+ T lymphocytes (TLs) from patients with hematological malignancies differ between patients who have and have not received transfusions. There may be several reasons for these differences, including the presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from plasma membrane budding and present in the platelet concentrates. Indeed, EVs can modulate the immune system through interactions with many immune cells, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Methods We therefore investigated how interactions with CD41a+ EVs cause immune cells to change phenotype and function. CD41a+ EVs were cultured with TLs, B lymphocytes, and monocytes. Given the potential involvement of monocytes in leukemia progression, we performed a new original multi-omics study to confirm the protein changes and gene activation observed following interaction with CD41a+ EVs Results The CD41a+ EVs had immunomodulatory effects on all these cell types but this effect depended on the numbers of EVs. CD4+ TLs required large numbers of CD41a+ EVs for activation, whereas monocytes were the most sensitive. With the new multi-omics technique, we confirmed the direct effects of CD41a+ EVs on protein phenotype and gene activation. Conclusion Transfusion EVs should be considered during the immunological follow-up of patients after transfusion to detect immunological effects on malignant hemopathies, and during the development of new immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe condition characterized by extensive lung inflammation and increased alveolar-capillary permeability, often triggered by infections or systemic inflammatory responses. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based therapy holds promise for treating ARDS, as MSCs manifest immunomodulatory and regenerative properties that mitigate inflammation and enhance tissue repair. Primed MSCs, modified to augment specific functionalities, demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy in targeted therapies compared to naive MSCs. This study explored the immunomodulatory potential of MSCs using mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays and co-culture experiments with M1/M2 macrophages. Additionally, RNA sequencing was employed to identify alterations in immune and inflammation-related factors in primed MSCs. The therapeutic effects of primed MSCs were assessed in an LPS-induced ARDS mouse model, and the underlying mechanisms were investigated through spatial transcriptomics analysis. The study revealed that MSCs primed with IFN-γ and IL-1β significantly enhanced the suppression of T cell activity compared to naive MSCs, concurrently inhibiting TNF-α while increasing IL-10 production in macrophages. Notably, combined treatment with these two cytokines resulted in a significant upregulation of immune and inflammation-regulating factors. Furthermore, our analyses elucidated the mechanisms behind the therapeutic effects of primed MSCs, including the inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and enhancement of elastin fiber formation. Signaling pathway analysis confirmed that efficacy could be enhanced by modulating NFκB and TNF-α signaling. In conclusion, in early-phase ARDS, primed MSCs displayed enhanced homing capabilities, improved lung function, and reduced inflammation.">

        <tr id="Parasitic infections are a major worldwide health burden, yet most studies of CD8 T cell differentiation focus on acute viral and bacterial infections. To understand effector and memory CD8 T cell responses during erythrocytic malaria infection in mice, we utilized transgenic OT-I T cells and compared CD8 T cell responses between infection with OVA-expressing strains of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). We find that CD8 T cells expand vigorously during both infections. However, in contrast to Lm infection, PbA infection induces T cells that are heavily biased toward an IL-7Ra-deficient and KLRG1+ short-lived effector cell (SLEC) phenotype at the expense of memory precursor effector cell (MPECs) formation. PbA-induced inflammation, including IFNγ, is partially responsible for this outcome. Following treatment with antimalarial drugs and T cell contraction, PbA-primed memory T cells are rarely found in the blood and peripheral tissues but do maintain a low presence in the spleen and bone marrow. Despite these poor numbers, PbA memory T cells robustly expand upon vaccination or viral infection, control pathogen burden, and form secondary memory pools. Thus, despite PbA enforced SLEC formation and limited memory, effective secondary responses can still proceed.">

        <tr id="Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical condition. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKI have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatment options remain limited. Studies have shown that immune cells play a critical role in AKI, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) being one of the most important immunosuppressive lymphocytes. Tregs proliferation can attenuate AKI, whereas depletion exacerbates kidney injury. Given that endothelial cells (ECs) are the initial cells that interact with immune cells when they invade the tissue parenchyma, ECs are closely associated with immune reactions. Methods and results In this study, P-selectin binding peptide-extracellular vesicles (PBP-EVs) that target and repair ECs are engineered. Transcriptome sequencing reveals that PBP-EVs reduce the expression of inflammatory genes in AKI mice. Using high-resolution intravital two-photon microscopy (TPM), an increased recruitment of Tregs in the kidneys of AKI Foxp3-EGFP transgenic mice following PBP-EVs treatment is observed, as well as significant Lgr5+ renal stem cell proliferation in AKI Lgr5-CreERT2; R26mTmG mice. Additionally, PBP-EVs treatment result in reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, pathological damage and fibrosis of AKI mice. Upon depletion of Tregs in Foxp3-DTR transgenic mice, we observe diminished therapeutic effect of PBP-EVs on AKI. Conclusions The experimental results indicate that PBP-EVs can promote the repair and regeneration of AKI by mitigating endothelial cell damage and subsequently modulating Tregs and the immune microenvironment. These findings provide novel insights and strategies for the treatment of AKI. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-025-06268-x.">

        <tr id="The body’s innate immune system plays a pivotal role in identifying and eliminating cancer cells. However, as the immune system ages, its functionality can deteriorate, becoming dysfunctional, inefficient, or even inactive—a condition referred to as immunosenescence. This decline significantly increases the risk of malignancies. While the pro-cancer effects of T-cell aging have been widely explored, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the impact of aging on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. This review seeks to address this gap, with emphasis on these cell types. Furthermore, although certain cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of cancers, elderly patients are less likely to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. In some cases, they may even experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While senolytic strategies have shown promise in exerting anti-cancer effects, their adverse reactions and potential off-target effects present significant challenges. This review aims to elucidate the pro-cancer effects of immunosenescence, its implications for the efficacy and safety of ICIs, and potential anti-aging treatment strategies. In addition, optimizing anti-aging therapies to minimize adverse reactions and enhance therapeutic outcomes remains a critical focus for future research endeavors.">

        <tr id="Tumors often arise in chronically inflamed, and thus immunologically highly active niches. While immune cells are able to recognize and remove transformed cells, tumors eventually escape the control of the immune system by shaping their immediate microenvironment. In this context, macrophages are of major importance, as they initially exert anti-tumor functions before they adopt a tumor-associated phenotype that instead inhibits anti-tumor immune responses and even allows for sustaining a smoldering inflammatory, growth promoting tumor microenvironment (TME). Type I interferons (IFNs) are well established modulators of inflammatory reactions. While they have been shown to directly inhibit tumor growth, there is accumulating evidence that they also play an important role in altering immune cell functions within the TME. In the present review, we focus on the impact of type I IFNs on anti-tumor responses, driven by monocytes and macrophages. Specifically, we will provide an overview of tumor-intrinsic factors, which impinge on IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, like the presence of nucleic acids, metabolites, or hypoxia. We will further summarize the current understanding of the consequences of altered IFN responses on macrophage phenotypes, i.e., differentiation, polarization, and functions. For the latter, we will focus on macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing and phagocytosis, as well as on how macrophages affect their environment by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with immune cells. Finally, we will discuss how type I IFN responses in macrophages might affect and should be considered for current and future tumor therapies.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial constituents of innate immunity, playing a vital role in the early defense against viral infections and cancer. Their antiviral capabilities stem from direct cytotoxic activity against infected cells and immunoregulatory functions that modulate adaptive immune responses. In the context of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), NK cells contribute to controlling viral replication and limiting excessive inflammatory responses.



 This review highlights the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity, focusing on their interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). We discuss potential sources of NK cells for adoptive transfer therapy, critical factors influencing their therapeutic efficacy, and considerations for clinical translation in COVID-19 treatment.



 Various NK cell sources for adoptive therapy are discussed, including peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetically engineered NK cells. Key factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NK cell-based therapies are analyzed, including cytokine modulation, NK cell subset selection, and delivery methods.



 Understanding the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity and the factors that influence the success of adoptive NK cell therapy can inform the design of more effective immunotherapies for COVID-19 patients. Strategies for improving NK cell function, such as genetic modification and optimizing therapy protocols, are highlighted to enhance therapeutic outcomes.



 NK cells neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by releasing cytotoxic granules, inhibiting replication, and modulating inflammation. They originate from peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetic engineering. Therapeutic strategies include adoptive transfer, cytokine modulation, and optimized delivery. Inflammation is controlled, reducing excessive immune responses.

        <tr id="Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) initiates secondary injuries that worsen neurological damage and hinder recovery. While peripheral immune responses play a key role in stroke outcomes, clinical results from immunotherapy have been suboptimal, with limited focus on T-cell dynamics. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) offer therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. They can regulate immune responses and reduce neuroinflammation, potentially enhancing recovery by fostering a pro-regenerative peripheral immune environment. However, the effect of UMSCs on T-cell dynamics in AIS remains underexplored. This study investigates T-cell dynamics following AIS and examines how UMSCs may mitigate immune dysregulation to develop better treatment strategies. Methods AIS patients (NIHSS scores 0–15) were recruited within 72 h of stroke onset, with peripheral blood samples collected on Day 0 (enrollment) and Day 7. T-cell compartments were identified by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine levels were quantified using a cytometric bead array (CBA). Mitochondria in UMSCs were labeled with MitoTracker. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were isolated, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cocultured with UMSCs in both direct contact and Transwell systems. Flow cytometry, CBA, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect T-cell compartments, gene expression markers for helper T (Th) cell differentiation, cytokine profiles, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA in UMSCs was depleted. The effects of UMSCs and mitochondria-depleted UMSCs on ischemic stroke mice were compared through behavioral assessments and analysis of the peripheral immune microenvironment. Results In AIS, T-cell compartments underwent a phenotypic shift from naïve to effector or memory states, with a specific increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells, leading to alterations in T-cell-mediated immune functions. In an ex vivo co-culture system, LPS stimulation further amplified these disparities, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in T cells. Notably, UMSCs restored mitochondrial function and reversed the shift in T-cell compartments through mitochondrial transfer. Critically, UMSC treatment significantly improved both neurological deficits and peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke mice, whereas mitochondria-depleted UMSCs failed to produce this effect. Conclusions Our comprehensive insights into the key attributes of T-cell compartments in acute ischemic stroke and the immune regulatory mechanisms of UMSCs provide a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke and the therapeutic potential of UMSC treatment.

        <tr id="Abstract Checkpoint inhibitors have led to remarkable benefits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet response rates remain below expectations. High-dimensional analysis and mechanistic experiments in clinical samples and relevant NSCLC models uncovered the immune composition of lung cancer tissues, providing invaluable insights into the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating T cells and myeloid cells. Among myeloid cells, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) stand out for their unique ability to induce effector CD8 T cells against neoantigens and coordinate antitumoral immunity. Notably, lung resident cDC1 are particularly abundant and long-lived and express a unique tissue-specific gene program, underscoring their central role in lung immunity. Here, we discuss recent insights on the induction and regulation of antitumoral T cell responses in lung cancer, separating it from the tissue-agnostic knowledge generated from heterogeneous tumor models. We focus on the most recent studies dissecting functional states and spatial distribution of lung cDC1 across tumor stages and their impact on T cell responses to neoantigens. Finally, we highlight relevant gaps and emerging strategies to harness lung cDC1 immunostimulatory potential.">

        <tr id="Background Arginine metabolism in tumors is often shunted into the pathway producing pro-tumor and immune suppressive polyamines (PAs), while downmodulating the alternative nitric oxide (NO) synthesis pathway. Aiming to correct arginine metabolism in tumors, arginine deprivation therapy and inhibitors of PA synthesis have been developed. Despite some therapeutic advantages, these approaches have often yielded severe side effects, making it necessary to explore an alternative strategy. We previously reported that supplementing sepiapterin (SEP), the endogenous precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, the essential NO synthase cofactor), could correct arginine metabolism in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and induce their metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming. We saw that oral SEP treatment effectively suppressed the growth of HER2-positive mammary tumors in animals. SEP also has no reported dose-dependent toxicity in clinical trials for metabolic disorders. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that a long-term administration of SEP to individuals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumor would protect them against tumor occurrence. Methods We administered SEP, in comparison to control DMSO, to MMTV-neu mice susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors for 8 months starting at their pre-pubertal stage. We monitored tumor onsets to determine the rate of tumor-free survival. After 8 months of treatment, we grouped animals into DMSO treatment with or without tumors and SEP treatment with or without tumors. We analyzed blood metabolites, PBMC, and bone marrow of DMSO vs. SEP treated animals. Results We found that a long-term use of SEP in animals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors effectively suppressed tumor occurrence. These SEP-treated animals had undergone reprogramming of the systemic metabolism and immunity, elevating total T cell counts in the circulation and bone marrow. Given that bone marrow-resident T cells are mostly memory T cells, it is plausible that chronic SEP treatment promoted memory T cell formation, leading to a potent tumor prevention. Conclusions These findings suggest the possible roles of the SEP/BH4/NO axis in promoting memory T cell formation and its potential therapeutic utility for preventing HER2-positive breast cancer.

        <tr id="Recent studies on the pathogenesis of leukemia have led to remarkable advances in disease treatment. Numerous studies have shown the potential and viability of immune responses against leukemia. In the classical pathway, this process is often initiated by the upstream activity of CD39, which hydrolyzes extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to AMP. Subsequently, CD73 acts on AMP to generate adenosine, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, CD73 can also utilize substrates derived from other molecules through the non-canonical NAD+ pathway, specifically via the CD38/CD203a/CD73 axis, further enhancing adenosine production and facilitating immune escape. Targeting CD73 has shown potential in disrupting these immunosuppressive pathways, thereby enhancing anti-leukemic immune responses and improving patient outcomes. Inhibiting CD73 not only reduces the levels of immunosuppressive adenosine but also increases the efficacy of existing immunotherapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, making it a versatile therapeutic target in leukemia treatment. This review discusses the potential of CD73 as a therapeutic target and emphasizes its unique position in the immune escape mechanism of leukemia. Moreover, this review provides an overview of the current research progress and future trends, emphasizing the clinical significance of targeting CD73 and other potential therapeutic strategies in leukemia.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) play a key role in controlling tumor dissemination by mediating cytotoxicity towards cancer cells without the need of education. These cells are pivotal in eliminating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the bloodstream, thus limiting cancer spread and metastasis. However, aggressive CTCs can evade NK cell surveillance, facilitating tumor growth at distant sites. In this review, we first discuss the biology of NK cells, focusing on their functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the lymphatic system, and circulation. We then examine the immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells to inhibit NK cell activity, including the upregulation of inhibitory receptors. Finally, we explore the clinical implications of monitoring circulating biomarkers, such as NK cells and CTCs, for therapeutic decision-making and emphasize the need to enhance NK cell-based therapies by overcoming immune escape mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Objectives To explore the phenotype and role of gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Methods Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR were employed to analyze γδ T cell subsets, chemokine receptor expression, cytokine production, pro-fibrotic gene expression, and transcription factor profiles. Immunofluorescence assessed Vδ2 T cell infiltration in affected tissues. Chemotaxis assays and co-culture experiments investigated Vδ2 T cell migration and their influence on B cell differentiation. The impact of IL-21 stimulation and JAK/STAT3 inhibitors on γδ T cell was also evaluated. Results Patients with IgG4-RD exhibited decreased peripheral Vδ2 T cells displaying a Th2-like phenotype characterized by elevated Th2 cytokine production and activated IL-21—STAT3—Blimp-1—GATA3 pathway. Vδ2 T cells accumulated in affected tissues through CCR7 upregulation, and co-localizing with B cells. Both Vδ2 T cells and culture supernatants from IgG4-RD patients promoted B cell differentiation. IL-21 stimulation augmented pSTAT3, Blimp-1, and GATA3 expression in Vδ2 T cells, while JAK and STAT3 inhibitors attenuated these effects. IgG4-RD patients exhibited increased TGF-β and pro-fibrotic gene expression in γδ T cells. Conclusion Within the IL-21-rich microenvironment of IgG4-RD, peripheral Vδ2 T cells acquire a Th2-like phenotype via the IL-21—STAT3—Blimp-1—GATA3 pathway. Targeting JAK/STAT3 inhibitors holds therapeutic potential for IgG4-RD.">

        <tr id="Brain metastases (BMs) are a relatively common and severe complication in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly affecting patient prognosis. Metastatic tumor cells can alter the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote an immunosuppressive state, characterized by reduced infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), diminished expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and changes in other proinflammatory factors and immune cell populations. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, play a pivotal role in modulating the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment through interactions with metastatic cancer cells, astrocytes, and infiltrating T cells. The M2 phenotype of microglia contributes to immunosuppression in BM via the activation of signaling pathways such as STAT3 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of the immune landscape of BMs in NSCLC, particularly regarding immune evasion within the CNS. Current immunotherapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise for NSCLC patients with BM, demonstrating intracranial activity and manageable safety profiles. Future research is warranted to further explore the molecular and immune mechanisms underlying BM, aiming to develop more effective treatments.">

        <tr id="Background Ageing-associated remodeling of the murine B cell system is accompanied with a reduction of CD19+ B cells such as follicular B cells (FOB) and an accumulation of age-associated B cells (ABC) or activated B cell subsets. This remodeling is thought to confer an attenuated antibody response, such as to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) vaccines in both aged mice and humans. To gain insight into the de novo development and function of an old B cell system, we reconstituted young and old immune systems by transferring hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from immune-competent young (2–3 months) CD45.1+ donors (DY-HSC) or old (20–24 months) donors (DO-HSC) into T and B cell-deficient young recipient CD45.2+ RAG1−/− mice, followed by protein-based vaccination. Results In the same environment of young RAG1−/− mice, transplanted DO-HSCs compared to DY-HSCs reconstituted lower numbers of CD19+ B cells and CD45.1+ cells, though the engraftment of donor-derived HSCs in the young bone marrow (BM) was very similar. Furthermore, indicative for youthful and unchallenged B cell systems, and in contrast to aged mice, very low levels of antigen-experienced memory B cells or age-associated B cells (ABC) developed in both DY-HSC and DO-HSC hosts. The commercially available recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) induced lower IgG+ S-antibody titers and pseudovirus neutralization activity in old compared to young mice. In contrast, very similar high IgG+ S-antibody titers were induced in DO-HSC and DY-HSC hosts, and pseudovirus neutralization activity was even enhanced in DO-HSC compared with DY-HSC hosts. Conclusions Both DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs established in the young recipient BM to a similar extend, suggesting that the concomitant reduction in the de novo reconstitution of CD19+ B cells in DO-HSC vs. DY-HSC transplanted animals is specifically related to old HSCs. DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs reconstitute very similar unchallenged B cell systems that efficiently elicit antigen-specific IgG antibodies by protein-based vaccination. Old HSCs thus retain competence to reconstitute a youthful and functional B cell system, at least in the young environment of transplanted RAG1−/− mice. This suggests that it is primarily age-related factors, and not HSCs per se, that influence the composition and functionality of the old B cell system.

        <tr id="Myeloid cells are a major component of immune cells infiltrating tumors, interacting with each other, with tumor cells and other stromal cells, and demonstrating a prominent plasticity. Neutrophils, as a population of such cells, contribute to cancer progression via multiple mechanisms, including stimulation of angiogenesis and the regulation of adaptive immune responses. Importantly, neutrophils were demonstrated to be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with different kinds of cancer, including head and neck cancer, renal cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma or melanoma. Enrichment of neutrophils was also associated with metastases in various tumor entities. 
Activity of neutrophils strongly depends on the cytokines or growth factors present in the microenvironment. Since these cells are highly plastic and their functionality can be easily altered, they are ideal target for anti-tumor therapies. Since we observe that elevated STAT3 is associated with pro-tumoral activity of neutrophils, we tested here the approach to functionally reprogram these cells by the inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway. We could show that such STAT3 inhibition solely in neutrophils led to decreased tumor growth and metastasis in cancer, which was accompanied by a significant expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Comprehensive multiparameter analyses of tumors and TDLNs revealed a significant enrichment of CD8+ T cell subsets with strongly cytotoxic activity, which effectively killed cancer cells in vitro. These findings provide novel insights in therapeutic avenues and suggest neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition as a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health concern due to its poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options, particularly in advanced stages. Tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), plays a key role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. TAMs exhibit plasticity, shifting between pro-inflammatory M1 and immunosuppressive M2 phenotypes, with the latter predominating in GC and contributing to poor outcomes. Recent therapeutic advancements focus on targeting TAMs, including inhibiting M2 polarization, reprogramming TAMs to M1 phenotypes, and combining TAM-targeted approaches with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Innovations in nanotechnology, metabolic reprogramming, and targeting key pathways such as interleukin-6 and C-C motif ligand 2/C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 further enhance these strategies. However, challenges remain, including the spatial and functional heterogeneity of TAMs within the TME and the need for selective targeting to avoid disrupting immune homeostasis. Ongoing research on TAM origins, functions, and interactions within the TME is crucial for developing precise and effective therapies. These advances hold promise not only for improving outcomes in GC but also for addressing other cancers with similarly complex microenvironments.">

        <tr id="Relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a challenging disease with a dismal prognosis. Despite the revolutionary impact of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19)-T cell therapy, >50% of patients relapse within a year. Both leukemia cell-intrinsic factors favoring immune escape and poor CAR-T cell persistence contribute significantly to clinical failure. Moreover, the expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and their ligands within the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may contribute to leukemia progression and therapy resistance. Here, we comprehensively characterized the expression of ICRs and their ligands in leukemic blasts, T cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from B-ALL BM samples at diagnosis (n=47) and relapse (n=38), comparing them with age-matched healthy BM controls. Our findings reveal a significant upregulated expression of TIM-3 in T cells, and its ligand galectin-9 in both blasts and MSCs throughout disease progression. The expression levels of galectin-9 in B-ALL blasts and TIM-3 in CAR19-T cells negatively correlate with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that galectin-9 impairs CAR19-T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Notably, an engineered TIM-3-Fc decoy receptor, delivered either by primary T cells co-administered with CAR19-T cells or via a bicistronic all-in-one CAR19-TIM-3-Fc construct, improved the anti-leukemia efficacy and persistence of CAR19-T cells in B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, CAR19-TIM-3-Fc-T cell treatment promotes the in vivo expansion of both transduced and bystander effector and memory T cells, as determined by spectral flow cytometry. Collectively, these potent and persistent TIM-3-Fc decoy-armored CAR19-T cells offer a promising therapeutic strategy for R/R B-ALL patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation in autoimmunity is driven by T cell hyperactivation. This unregulated response to self is fuelled by heightened metabolic programmes, which offers a promising new direction to uncover novel treatment strategies. α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH), and its expression in CD4+ T cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T cell metabolism and function – and thus, the downstream implication for autoimmunity – is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using a murine model of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T cell-mediated autoimmunity. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with dysregulated/chronic inflammation. The immune system has multiple roles including beneficial effects such as clearing alpha synuclein aggregates. However, peripheral immune cells entering the brain may also contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. To identify which cells might have a negative impact and could be potential therapeutic targets, we compared immune signatures of patients and healthy controls.


METHODS
Multicolor flow cytometry was used to determine the frequencies of major immune cell subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD patients and controls. Because of the major impact of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the distribution of immune cell subsets, particularly cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T-cells, all participants were tested for CMV seropositivity.


RESULTS
Although the cohort of 35 PD patients exhibited the well-established T-cell differentiation signature driven by CMV infection, there were no differences in the frequencies of differentiated or pro-inflammatory T-cells, B-cells or natural killer cells (NK-cells) attributable to the disease. However, percentages of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were higher in PD patients than controls. Moreover, percentages of CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) monocytes expressing the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) correlated with disease severity assessed by the Movement Disorder Society's revised version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score and disease duration.


CONCLUSIONS
A comprehensive evaluation of the major subsets of circulating immune cells in PD patients revealed differences in myeloid cells between PD and healthy controls and some correlation of monocyte abundance with disease severity.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a specialized subset of memory T cells that permanently reside in non-lymphoid tissues, providing localized and long-lasting immune protection. In the urinary tract, TRM cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of TRM cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging TRM cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of TRM cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.">

        <tr id="γδT cells represent a unique and versatile subset of T cells characterized by the expression of T-cell receptors (TCRs) composed of γ and δ chains. Unlike conventional αβT cells, γδT cells do not require major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent antigen presentation for activation, enabling them to recognize and respond to a wide array of antigens, including phosphoantigens, stress-induced ligands, and tumor-associated antigens. While γδT cells are relatively rare in peripheral blood, they are enriched in peripheral tissues such as the skin, intestine, and lung. These cells play a crucial role in tumor immunotherapy by exerting direct cytotoxicity through the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-17 (IL-17)) and cytotoxic molecules (e.g., perforin and granzyme). Recent advances in γδT cell research have elucidated their mechanisms of tumor recognition, including the detection of phosphoantigens and stress-induced ligands like MICA (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A), MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B), and ULBP (UL16-binding protein). Furthermore, various strategies to enhance γδT cell-based tumor immunotherapy have been developed, such as in vitro expansion using phosphoantigen-based therapies, cytokine stimulation, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδT cell engineering. These advancements have shown promising results in both preclinical and clinical settings, paving the way for γδT cells to become a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy. This review highlights the key mechanisms, functions, and strategies to harness the potential of γδT cells for effective tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a complex immune response triggered by brain injury or pathological stimuli, and is highly exacerbated in neurodegenerative diseases. It plays a dual role in the central nervous system, promoting repair in acute stages while aggravating disease progression by contributing to neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, and glial dysregulation in chronic phases. Inflammatory responses are mainly orchestrated by microglia and infiltrated monocytes, which, when dysregulated, not only harm existing neurons, but also impair the survival and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells in the affected brain regions. Modulating neuroinflammation is crucial for harnessing its protective functions while minimizing its detrimental effects. Current therapeutic strategies focus on fine-tuning inflammatory responses through pharmacological agents, bioactive molecules, and stem cell-based therapies. These approaches aim to restore immune homeostasis, support neuroprotection, and promote regeneration in various neurological disorders. However, animal models sometimes fail to reproduce human-specific inflammatory responses in the brain. In this context, stem-cell-derived models provide a powerful tool to study neuroinflammatory mechanisms in a patient-specific and physiologically relevant context. These models facilitate high-throughput screening, personalized medicine, and the development of targeted therapies while addressing the limitations of traditional animal models, paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments.">

        <tr id="Significant advancements have been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of type 2 immunity in allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), food and drug allergies, and atopic dermatitis (AD). Type 2 immunity has evolved to protect against parasitic diseases and toxins, plays a role in the expulsion of parasites and larvae from inner tissues to the lumen and outside the body, maintains microbe-rich skin and mucosal epithelial barriers and counterbalances the type 1 immune response and its destructive effects. During the development of a type 2 immune response, an innate immune response initiates starting from epithelial cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including dendritic cells and macrophages, and translates to adaptive T and B-cell immunity, particularly IgE antibody production. Eosinophils, mast cells and basophils have effects on effector functions. Cytokines from ILC2s and CD4+ helper type 2 (Th2) cells, CD8 + T cells, and NK-T cells, along with myeloid cells, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, initiate and sustain allergic inflammation via T cell cells, eosinophils, and ILC2s; promote IgE class switching; and open the epithelial barrier. Epithelial cell activation, alarmin release and barrier dysfunction are key in the development of not only allergic diseases but also many other systemic diseases. Recent biologics targeting the pathways and effector functions of IL4/IL13, IL-5, and IgE have shown promising results for almost all ages, although some patients with severe allergic diseases do not respond to these therapies, highlighting the unmet need for a more detailed and personalized approach.">

        <tr id="Background In addition to serving as the primary effector cells against infections, neutrophils have been implicated in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of neutrophils in the regulation of the immune system under physiological conditions. Methods The in vivo effect of neutrophils on the immune system was examined using neutropenic mice. The interaction between neutrophils and γδ T cells was investigated using an in vitro co-culture system. Findings Unexpectedly, we observed an accumulation of γδ T cells in the cervical lymph nodes of neutropenic mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that these γδ T cells exhibited unique expression profiles of cell surface molecules and genes involved in defense responses. Further characterization indicated that the accumulated γδ T cells were IL-17 producing CD44+CD62L−CD27− memory cells. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that neutrophils could inhibit the function of IL-17A producing γδ T cells by inducing cell death in a contact-dependent manner. Conclusion This present study demonstrates that neutrophils negatively regulate IL-17 producing γδ T cells under physiological conditions. Given that IL-17A is a critical cytokine for the recruitment of neutrophils to peripheral tissues, our study suggests that the crosstalk between neutrophils and IL-17A producing γδ T cells is a crucial mechanism for maintaining immune homeostasis under physiological conditions.">

        <tr id="In the realm of oncology, the tumor microenvironment (TME)—comprising extracellular matrix components, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells—plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to therapeutic interventions. Initially, the TME exhibits tumor-suppressive properties that can inhibit malignant transformation. However, as the tumor progresses, various factors induce immune tolerance, resulting in TME behaving in a state that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in later stages. This state of immunosuppression is crucial as it enables TME to change from a role of killing tumor cells to a role of promoting tumor progression. Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with an alarmingly high mortality rate. While chemotherapy has historically been the cornerstone of treatment, its efficacy in prolonging survival remains limited. The emergence of immunotherapy has opened new therapeutic pathways, yet the challenge of immune tolerance driven by the gastric cancer microenvironment complicates these efforts. This review aims to elucidate the intricate role of the TME in mediating immune tolerance in gastric cancer and to spotlight innovative strategies and clinical trials designed to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. By providing a comprehensive theoretical framework, this review seeks to advance the understanding and application of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.">

The TME plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulating processes such as cancer cell migration, proliferation, tumor vascularization, and the modulation of anti-cancer immune responses. 2 Effects of the TME are partially mediated by secreted factors, including exosomes, metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and a remodeled extracellular matrix produced by CAFs, which profoundly in ﬂ uence cancer progression. 2 Numerous studies revealed that the TME plays a pivotal role in modulating anti-cancer immune responses, either promoting or suppressing these processes in a manner that appears highly context-dependent. 3 Effective immune responses against cancer cells basically involve three different key mechanisms.

        <tr id="CAR T cells therapies have demonstrated success in treating hematologic malignancies, but have proven less effective in eradicating solid tumors. While suppressive immune cells may contribute to reduced CAR T cell efficacies in malignant masses, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are also believed to facilitate tumor survival by secreting growth factors, immunosuppressive cytokines, and extracellular matrix components that inhibit drug and immune cell filtration and facilitate metastasis. In an effort to eliminate both CAFs and cancer cells simultaneously, we have employed a universal CAR T cell that can attack both cell types when supplemented with appropriate bispecific adapters. We show here that tumor regression is indeed enhanced when CAR T cells are directed to concurrently kill both cancer cells and CAFs. We further demonstrate that simultaneous targeting of both cell types enhances CAR T cell proliferation, activation, tumor infiltration, and tumor distribution relative to targeting only a single cell type. Because all of these benefits are achieved in both cold and hot tumors without significant toxicity, we conclude that use of a universal CAR T cell in combination with multiple bispecific adapters can provide a safe, potent, cost-effective, and scalable alternative to the treatment of solid tumors with conventional CAR T cells.">

        <tr id="The potential of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination against cancer is not fully achieved. Little is known about the precise nature of the anti-cancer immune response triggered by different natural DC subsets and their relevance in preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. Here, we use mouse splenic conventional DC1s (cDC1s) or cDC2s pulsed with tumor cell lysates to generate DC vaccines. cDC1-based vaccination induces a stronger effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ anti-tumor T cell response, leading to a better control of tumors treated either therapeutically or prophylactically. Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4+ tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8+ memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4+ Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma. Our findings suggest that cDC1-based vaccination excels at immune memory induction and prevention of cancer recurrence.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease with an unknown etiology and complex pathophysiology that are not fully understood. The disease involves intricate cellular interplay, particularly among various immune cells. Currently, there is no treatment capable of reversing the fibrotic process or aiding lung regeneration. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has demonstrated antifibrotic properties, whereas the adoptive transfer of modified T cells is a well‐established treatment for various malignancies. We aimed to understand the dynamics of T cells in the progression of lung fibrosis and to study the therapeutic benefit of adoptive T cell transfer in a bleomycin‐injured mouse lung (BLM) model. Methods T cells were isolated from the spleen of naïve mice and transfected in vitro with mouse HGF plasmid and were administered intratracheally to the mice lungs 7 days post‐bleomycin injury to the lung. Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage were collected and analyzed using flow cytometry, histology, qRT‐PCR, ELISA, and hydroxyproline assay. Results Our findings demonstrate the successful T cell therapy of bleomycin‐induced lung injury through the adoptive transfer of HGF‐transfected T cells in mice. This treatment resulted in decreased collagen deposition and a balancing of immune cell exhaustion and cytokine homeostasis compared with untreated controls. In vitro testing showed enhanced apoptosis in myofibroblasts induced by HGF‐overexpressing T cells. Conclusions Taken together, our data highlight the great potential of adoptive T cell transfer as an emerging therapy to counteract lung fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) constitute a distinct population of non-circulating memory T cells1–5 vastly exceeding the number of circulating T cells5, and play a pivotal role in protective immunity against pathogens6–8. How to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm remains an important challenge. Whether Trm contribute also to immune control of tumors or just correlate with an unrelated process linked to clinical outcome has not been unequivocally established9,10, and phenotypic markers such as co-expression of CD69 and CD103 or CD49a integrins commonly used to monitor tumor infiltrating Trm do not unambiguously define this subset. Here we tested the hypothesis that transient downregulation of KLF2, the most conserved feature of Trm ontogeny4,11,12, will promote the differentiation of vaccine activated CD8+ T cells into Trm and enhance antitumor immunity. We show that 4-1BB antibody targeted delivery of a KLF2 siRNA to tumor bearing mice led to the downregulation of KLF2 in vaccine activated CD8+ T cells and the accumulation of phenotypically defined intratumoral CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD49a+ CD8+ T cells which correlated with enhanced control of tumor growth. This study could serve as the foundation of a broadly applicable and clinically useful way to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm and provides direct evidence that intratumoral CD8+CD69+CD103+ and CD8+CD69+CD49a+ cells are indeed Trm and that Trm contribute to tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Lactate has emerged as a key regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing both tumor progression and immune dynamics. As a byproduct of aerobic glycolysis, lactate satisfies the metabolic needs of proliferating tumor cells while reshaping the TME to facilitate immune evasion. Elevated lactate levels inhibit effector immune cells such as CD8+ T and natural killer cells, while supporting immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thus fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Lactate promotes epigenetic reprogramming, stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and activates nuclear factor kappa B, leading to further immunological dysfunction. In this review, we examined the role of lactate in metabolic reprogramming, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism, including lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors, and TME neutralization methods, all of which can restore immune function and enhance immunotherapy outcomes. By highlighting recent advances, this review provides a theoretical foundation for integrating lactate-targeted therapies into clinical practice. We also highlight the potential synergy between these therapies and current immunotherapeutic strategies, providing new avenues for addressing TME-related challenges and improving outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, necessitating innovative treatments. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are primary immunosuppressive effectors that foster tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. They are broadly categorized into proinflammatory M1 and tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes, with elevated M2 infiltration correlating with poor prognosis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting TAM recruitment, depleting TAMs, or reprogramming M2 to M1 are therefore highly promising. Key signaling pathways, such as CSF-1/CSF-1R, IL-4/IL-13–STAT6, TLRs, and CD47-SIRPα, regulate TAM polarization. Additionally, macrophage-based drug delivery systems permit targeted agent transport to hypoxic regions, enhancing therapy. Preclinical studies combining TAM-targeted therapies with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded improved responses and prolonged survival. Several clinical trials have also reported benefits in previously unresponsive patients. Future work should clarify the roles of macrophage-derived exosomes, cytokines, and additional mediators in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These insights will inform the design of next-generation drug carriers and optimize combination immunotherapies within precision medicine frameworks. Elucidating TAM phenotypes and their regulatory molecules remains central to developing novel strategies that curb tumor progression and ultimately improve outcomes in lung cancer. Importantly, macrophage-based immunomodulation may offer expanded treatment avenues.">

        <tr id="Introduction Burn-induced sepsis is a critical clinical challenge marked by systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and high mortality. Macrophage-driven inflammatory pathways are central to sepsis pathogenesis, while immune cell metabolic reprogramming plays a key role in both sepsis and cancer progression. Methods Bioinformatics analyses using GEO, TCGA, and GTEx datasets identified MLIP-modulated genes linked to immune responses and prognosis. In vitro, LPS-stimulated HUVEC cells were used to study MLIP’s effects on inflammation and macrophage function through cell viability, ROS levels, cytokine expression, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays. Results MLIP-modulated genes were associated with immune-related metabolic pathways in both sepsis and cancer. Epigenetic analysis showed MLIP expression is regulated by promoter methylation and chromatin accessibility. Prognostic analyses revealed MLIP’s impact on survival outcomes across cancer types. In vitro, MLIP reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and macrophage hyperactivation. Conclusions MLIP regulates immune-metabolic dynamics in burn-induced sepsis, influencing macrophage activity and oxidative stress. Its role in metabolic reprogramming suggests MLIP as a potential therapeutic target linking immune modulation and cancer progression. Further research on MLIP’s role in immune evasion and tumor metabolism may inform novel therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction The interactions between T-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (T-CLPD) tumor cells and the bystander immune cells may play a critical role in the failure of immune surveillance and disease progression, but the altered blood immune profiles of T-CLPD remain unknown. Methods Here we analyzed the distribution of residual non-tumoral immune cells in blood of 47 T-CLPD patients -14 T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), 7 Sézary syndrome/mycosis fungoides (SS/MF) and 26 T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL)-, as tumor models of neoplastic T-cells that resemble naive/central memory (N/CM), memory and terminal effector T-cells, respectively, compared to 110 age- and sex-matched healthy donors, using spectral flow cytometry. Results Overall, our results showed deeply altered immune cell profiles in T-PLL, characterized by significantly increased counts of monocytes, dendritic cells, B-cells, NK-cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC) -particularly ILC3-, together with reduced normal T-cells. In contrast, SS/MF showed neutrophilia, associated with decreased numbers of dendritic cells and NK-cells, potentially reflecting their increased migration from blood to the skin. In turn, T-LGLL displayed the mildest immune impairment, dependent on the TCD4+ vs. TCD8+ nature of the clonal T-cells and presence of STAT3 mutations among TαβCD8+ T-LGLL cases. Further dissection of the normal T-cell compartment showed a significant reduction of the earliest T-cell maturation compartments (N/CM) in T-PLL and SS/MF, whereas T-cells remained within normal ranges in T-LGLL, with only a minor reduction of N/CM T-cells. Conclusion These findings point out the existence of differentially altered innate and adaptive immune cell profiles in the distinct diagnostic subtypes of T-CLPD, with progressively less pronounced alterations from T-PLL and SS/MF to T-LGLL.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were first recognized over twenty years ago as a key immunomodulatory cell population. Since their initial identification, a growing body of literature points to the importance of MDSC as a heterogeneous, immunosuppressive cell population and as a therapeutic target in adults with cancer. MDSC are potent suppressors of T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells and can be helpful or harmful to the host depending on the pathophysiology. For example, MDSC are beneficial in pregnancy and prevent spontaneous abortion by promoting maternal-fetal tolerance. Increased MDSC are also associated with improved outcomes in patients with graft vs. host disease by decreasing T cell-driven inflammation. However, MDSC can also be harmful and are known to be pathologic in adults with cancer and chronic infections by promoting tumor escape and impairing pathogen clearance, respectively. Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of MDSC and their immune suppression effects in adults, much less is known regarding the role of MDSC in children. Research investigating MDSC in children lags significantly behind adult studies. In fact, while over 5,000 publications on PubMed discuss MDSC in immune regulation, fewer than 50 of these publications focus specifically on their role in children. This review aims to summarize the existing literature on the role of MDSC in children and identify important directions for future research, including targeting these cells in the pediatric population to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors. Among the pivotal pathways implicated in CRC tumorigenesis, the Notch signaling pathway is instrumental in governing cell fate decisions, tissue renewal, homeostasis, and immune cell development. As a highly conserved mechanism, Notch signaling not only modulates tumor cell behavior but also shapes the immune landscape within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Aberrant Notch signaling in CRC fosters immune evasion and tumor progression through its effects on the balance and functionality of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Elevated Notch pathway activation correlates with advanced clinicopathological features and poorer clinical outcomes, highlighting its relevance as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target. Therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting the Notch pathway, such as γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in combination with other therapies, have demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings. This review examines the impact of Notch signaling on CRC immunity, elucidating its regulatory mechanisms within immune cells and its role in promoting tumor progression. Additionally, this review discusses therapeutic strategies targeting Notch signaling, including GSIs, mAbs, and potential combination therapies designed to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. By elucidating the multifaceted role of Notch within the CRC TME, this review underscores its potential as a target for innovative therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="High grade gliomas (HGG) are incurable brain cancers, where inevitable disease recurrence is driven by tumour-initiating glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs survive and expand in the brain after surgery, radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, amidst weak immune and natural killer (NK) cell surveillance. The present study was designed to understand how to enhance the contribution of innate immunity to post TMZ disease control. Strikingly, molecular subtypes of HGG impacted the repertoire of NK cell sensitivity markers across human HGG transcriptomes, and in a panel of GSCs with either proneural (PN-GSC) or mesenchymal (MES-GSC) phenotypes. Indeed, only MES-GSCs (but not PN-GSCs) were enriched for NK cell ligands and sensitive to NK-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. While NK cells alone had no effect on HGG progression in vivo, the post-chemotherapy (TMZ) recurrence of MES-GSC-driven xenografts was aborted by timed intracranial injection of live or irradiated NK (NK92MI) cells, resulting in long term survival of animals. This curative effect declined when NK cell administration was delayed relative to TMZ exposure pointing to limits of the immune control over resurging residual tumour stem cell populations that survived chemotherapy. Overall, these results suggest that chemotherapy-dependent tumour depopulation may create a unique window of opportunity for NK-mediated intervention with curative effects restricted to a subset of HGGs driven by mesenchymal brain tumour initiating cells.

        <tr id="Inflammation, a hallmark of cancer, has been associated with tumor progression, transition into malignant phenotype and efficacy of anticancer treatments in cancer. It affects all stages of cancer, from the initiation of carcinogenesis to metastasis. Chronic inflammation induces immunosup-pression, providing an environment conducive to carcinogenesis, whereas acute inflammation induces an antitumor immune response, leading to tumor suppression. Solid tumors have an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) containing cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and soluble molecules, which plays a key role in tumor progression and therapy response. Both cancer cells and stromal cells in the TME are highly plastic and constantly change their phenotypic and functional properties. Cancer-associated inflammation, the majority of which consists of innate immune cells, plays an important role in cancer cell plasticity, cancer progression and the development of anticancer drug resistance. Today, with the combined used of advanced technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial molecular imaging analysis, the pathways linking chronic inflammation to cancer have been largely elucidated. In this review article, we highlighted the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cancer-associated inflammation and its effects on cancer progression and treatment response.

        <tr id="Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy of the small intestine triggered by gluten ingestion. Although the small bowel is the main organ affected, peripheral blood cell alterations have also been described in CD. We aimed to investigate immunological cell patterns in the blood of treated CD patients and in response to a 3-day gluten challenge (GC). Blood samples were collected from 10 patients with CD and 8 healthy controls on a gluten-free diet at baseline and 6 days after initiating the GC. All the samples were analyzed by spectral flow cytometry using a 34-marker panel. We found that patients with CD displayed a lower proportion of memory B cells compared to healthy controls, both at baseline and post-GC. Additionally, we observed the previously reported activated gut-homing CD4+, CD8+, and TCRγδ+ T lymphocytes on day 6 post-GC, and found the CD8+ subpopulation to be the most readily identifiable by flow cytometry. Importantly, the CCR9 marker proved effective in enhancing the selection of these gluten-responsive T cells, offering the potential for increased diagnostic accuracy. Spectral flow cytometry involves a complex data analysis, but it offers valuable insights into previously unexplored immunological responses and enables in-depth cell characterization.">

        <tr id="The spleen, the largest lymphatic organ, comprises a diverse array of immunocytes in approximately one quarter of the body, including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells (such as dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and macrophages). These immune cells undergo dynamic transitions and mobilization, enabling the spleen to execute a wide range of immunological functions. The spleen's structural organization and multicellular composition, along with its reservoir of lymphocytes, facilitate the capture and clearance of blood-borne antigens while also orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, the spleen plays critical roles in hematopoiesis and the removal of aged or damaged red blood cells. Despite being innervated by sympathetic (catecholaminergic) nerve fibers, the spleen lacks parasympathetic (vagal or cholinergic) innervation. The neuroimmune axis, particularly the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system immune circuits, significantly influences disease onset and progression. Extensive research employing physical, genetic, and pharmacological approaches has sought to directly modulate splenic immunocytes and activate neuroimmune interactions to restore immune homeostasis and counteract disease. Two primary mechanisms underlie these immunomodulatory interventions: (1) the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, wherein norepinephrine released by splenic catecholaminergic fibers binds to β2-adrenergic receptors on CD4⁺ T cells, triggering acetylcholine secretion, which in turn suppresses inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, and (2) direct immunomodulation of splenic immunocytes, which regulates key genes and signaling pathways, alters cytokine secretion, and modulates ion flux to influence cellular functions. Among various therapeutic strategies, physical methods, particularly electrical stimulation and splenic ultrasound stimulation, have demonstrated the greatest promise for clinical applications in splenic immunomodulation and disease management.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer immunotherapy has shown promising results in the clinic, but it faces great challenges such as low response rates and low efficacy in solid tumors. c-Rel, a member of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB family, is a newly described immune checkpoint for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which contribute to the formation of immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. How to selectively target myeloid c-Rel for the treatment of cancer is not well established. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of knocking down myeloid c-Rel with siRNA-loaded peptide-based nanoparticles as a new cancer immunotherapy strategy. Methods The knockdown of c-Rel gene by the siRNA-loaded peptide nanoparticles was confirmed on MDSCs in vitro and in vivo. The effects of c-Rel silencing on cell number and immune suppressive function of the murine bone marrow-derived MDSCs were then investigated. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the c-Rel siRNA loaded nanoparticles, female C57BL/6 mice with subcutaneous B16 tumor were treated with PBS, c-Rel siRNA loaded nanoparticles, control siRNA loaded nanoparticles or empty nanoparticles. The tumor growth and body weight of mice were monitored, and the numbers and immune activities of tumor infiltrated immune cells in different groups were analyzed at the end of the experiment. The immune function of MDSCs isolated from tumor bearing mice received different treatments were further investigated ex vivo by T cell proliferation assays. Results The c-Rel siRNA nanoparticles significantly reduced c-Rel expression in MDSCs, diminished both the number and immune suppressive function of MDSCs, and enhanced intratumor CD8+ T cell responses. Significantly reduced tumor growth was observed in mice treated with the c-Rel siRNA nanoparticles compared to control mice. Conclusion Our data indicates that peptide-based nanoparticles can be successfully utilized to target the myeloid immune checkpoint c-Rel for the treatment of cancer.">

Aging diminishes naive T cells, reducing potential diversity and leading to lymph node contraction. Here, we revealed that this decline occurs earlier in males, resulting in significant sex differences in immunity during middle age. Earlier in life, naive CD8 T cells in males become virtual memory cells prone to premature senescence. Due to androgen-driven thymic atrophy in males, naïve CD8 T cells are insufficiently replenished. Therapeutic thymus rejuvenation via testosterone ablation restored naive CD8 T cells in lymph nodes of middle-aged male mice, leading to enhanced tumor recognition. These findings show the crucial role of sex and age on lymph node T cell repertoires and suggest potential strategies to restore immune function in males during aging.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial disease involving genetic and environmental factors, including viral infection. We investigated the impact of interferon alpha (IFN-α), a cytokine produced during the immune response to viral infection or the presence of un-edited endogenous double-stranded RNAs, on human β-cell physiology. Intravital microscopy on transplanted human islets using a β-cell-selective reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor (RIP1-GRX1-roGFP2), revealed a subset of human β-cells that acutely produce ROS in response to IFN-α. Comparison to Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP) phenotypic data revealed that healthier donors had more ROS accumulating cells. In vitro IFN-α treatment of human islets similarly elicited a heterogenous increase in superoxide production that originated in the mitochondria. To determine the unique molecular signature predisposing cells to IFN-α stimulated ROS production, we flow sorted human islets treated with IFN-α. RNA sequencing identified genes involved in inflammatory and immune response in the ROS-producing cells. Comparison with single cell RNA-Seq datasets available through the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) showed that genes upregulated in ROS-producing cells are enriched in control β-cells rather than T1D donors. Combined, these data suggest that IFN-α stimulates mitochondrial ROS production in healthy human β-cells, potentially predicting a more efficient antiviral response.">

        <tr id="Understanding how different contributors within the tumor microenvironment (TME) function and communicate is essential for effective cancer detection and treatment. The TME encompasses all the surroundings of a tumor such as blood vessels, fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, exosomes, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Subsequently, effective cancer therapy relies on addressing TME alterations, known drivers of tumor progression, immune evasion, and metastasis. Immune cells and other cell types act differently under cancerous conditions, either driving or hindering cancer progression. For instance, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) include lymphocytes of B and T cell types that can invade malignancies, bringing in and enhancing the ability of immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Therefore, TILs display a promising approach to tackling the TME alterations and have the capability to significantly hinder cancer progression. Similarly, exosomes and inflammasomes exhibit a dual effect, resulting in either tumor progression or inhibition depending on the origin of exosomes, type of inflammasome and tumor. This review will explore how cells function in the presence of a tumor, the communication between cancer cells and immune cells, and the role of TILs, exosomes and inflammasomes within the TME. The efforts in this review are aimed at garnering interest in safer and durable therapies for cancer, in addition to providing a promising avenue for advancing cancer therapy and consequently improving survival rates.">

        <tr id="Anti-tumor immunity, including innate and adaptive immunity is critical in inhibiting tumorigenesis and development of tumor. The adaptive immunity needs specific lymph organs such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which are highly correlated with improved survival outcomes in many cancers. In recent years, with increasing attention on the TLS in tumor microenvironment, TLSs have emerged as a novel target for anti-tumor therapy. Excitingly, studies have shown the contribution of TLSs to the adaptive immune responses. However, it is unclear how TLSs to form and how to more effectively defense against tumor through TLS formation. Recent studies have shown that the inflammation plays a critical role in TLS formation. Interestingly, studies have also found that gut microbiota can regulate the occurrence and development of inflammation. Therefore, we here summarize the potential effects of gut microbiota- mediated inflammation or immunosuppression on the TLS formation in tumor environments. Meanwhile, this review also explores how to manipulate mature TLS formation through regulating gut microbiota/metabolites or gut microbiota associated signal pathways for anti-tumor immunity, which potentially lead to a next-generation cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Colon cancer (CC) remains a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, driven by difficulties in early diagnosis and constrained therapeutic options. Recent studies underscore the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in fostering malignancy progression and therapy resistance. Through their inherent plasticity, TAMs facilitate immunosuppression, angiogenic processes, metastatic spread, and drug tolerance. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which promote inflammatory and tumoricidal responses, M2 macrophages support tumor expansion and dissemination by exerting immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic influences. Consequently, manipulating TAMs has emerged as a potential avenue to enhance treatment effectiveness. This review outlines the origins, polarization states, and functions of TAMs in CC, highlights their role in driving tumor advancement, and surveys ongoing efforts to target these cells for better patient outcomes. Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating TAM functions - including depletion strategies, reprogramming approaches that shift M2-polarized TAMs toward an M1 phenotype, and inhibition of key signaling pathways sustaining TAM-mediated immunosuppression-are currently under active investigation. These approaches hold promise in overcoming TAM - induced resistance and improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in CC.">

However, their distribution varies among patients and different preclinical models of IBD. The expansion and activation of MDSCs are likely driven by various stimuli during intestinal inflammation, but the in-depth mechanisms remain poorly understood. The role of MDSCs in the pathogenesis of IBD appears to be paradoxical. In addition to intestinal inflammation, suppressive MDSCs may promote colitis-to-colon cancer transition.

        <tr id="Rationale: Advances in cancer therapies have significantly improved patient survival; however, tumors enriched in cancer stem cells (CSCs) have poor treatment responses. CSCs are a key source of tumor heterogeneity, contributing to therapeutic resistance and unfavorable patient outcomes. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), cell-in-cell (CIC) structures, where one cell engulfs another, have been identified as markers of poor prognosis. Despite their clinical relevance, the mechanisms underlying CIC formation across different tumor cell subpopulations remain largely unknown. Elucidating these processes could provide novel insights and therapeutic opportunities to address aggressive, treatment-resistant cancers. Method: Fluorescent mCherry-carrying colorectal cancer stem cells (CRCSCs) were expanded as spheroids in serum-free media and cocultured with either parental cancer cell-expressing Venus fluorescent protein or CFSE dye-stained immune cells (T cells, M1/M2 macrophages, neutrophils, and NK cells) or treated with EGFR- or PD-L1-targeting antibodies to assess the formation of CIC structures. Genes potentially crucial for the formation of CIC structures were knocked down or overexpressed, and their effects on CIC formation were evaluated. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings was confirmed through analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens. Results: CRCSCs have a strong predilection for serving as the outer cell in a CIC structure and forming homotypic CIC structures predominantly with parental CRC cells. The frequency of CIC structure formation increased when the cells were exposed to anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment. Both the outer CRCSC in a CIC structure and CRCSCs released from a homotypic CIC structure showed enhanced resistance to the cytotoxicity of NK-92MI cells. Restoration of Stathmin1 (STMN1) expression but not RAC1 knockdown in CRCSCs reduced the homotypic CIC frequency, disrupted the outer cell fate in CIC structures, and increased cell susceptibility to NK-92MI cytotoxicity. In CRC patients, CIC structures are associated with poor tumor differentiation, negative STMN1 expression, and poor prognosis. Conclusion: CSCs play a crucial role in informing CIC structures in CRC. CIC structure formation partially depends on low STMN1 expression and confers a survival advantage under NK cytotoxicity. Targeting this pathway may significantly improve immunotherapy's efficacy for CRC patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia stands as a significant factor that modulates immune responses, especially those driven by T cells. As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.


METHODS
To generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we used mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.


RESULTS
We made three specific observations: (1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 µm from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. (2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared with normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. (3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Despite recent advancements, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a therapeutic challenge. While monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) leveraging natural killer (NK) cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity show great potential, none have gained clinical approval for AML. Immunocytokines have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the limited efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. IL-15 stimulates activation, proliferation cytotoxic activity of NK cells, but its clinical use is prevented by short half-life, poor accumulation in the tumor, and toxicity due to systemic off-target immune activation. Here we report on the generation and preclinical characterization of modified immunocytokines consisting of an Fc-optimized CLEC12A (CLL-1) antibody fused to an IL-15 moiety with E46K mutation. The mutation abrogates binding to IL-15Rα, thereby enabling substitution of physiological trans-presentation by target binding and thus conditional IL-15Rβ/γ stimulation to reduce systemic toxicity. An optimal CLEC12A binder was selected from a range of murine mAbs, based on analysis of AML cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. This antibody was then used to construct an immunocytokine (MIC12) that subsequently was characterized functionally. Analysis of NK cell activation, cytokine release, proliferation and anti-leukemia reactivity demonstrated that MIC12 induced superior target cell killing and NK cell expansion compared to Fc-optimized CLEC12A antibody, with efficacy being dependent on target antigen binding. Our results show that novel immunocytokines with conditional IL-15 activity are capable of inducing potent NK cell responses against AML cells and identify MIC12 as promising therapeutic candidate for leukemia treatment.">

Their activation influences the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity by modulating immune cell recruitment, cytokine secretion, and T-cell differentiation. While inflammasomes can contribute to tumor growth and metastasis through chronic inflammation, their components also present novel therapeutic targets. Several inhibitors targeting inflammasome components- such as sensor proteins (e.g., NLRP3, AIM2), adaptor proteins (e.g., ASC), caspase-1, and downstream cytokines- are being explored to modulate inflammasome activity. These therapeutic strategies aim to modulate inflammasome activity to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes. Understanding the role of inflammasomes in cancer immunity is crucial for developing interventions that effectively bridge innate and adaptive immune responses for better therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8+ T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8+ T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, our data suggests that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction In type 2 diabetes (T2D), beta cell failure is often associated with islet inflammation driven by the innate immune response, with macrophages playing a significant role. However, the composition and phenotype of lymphoid immune cells in the islets of individuals with T2D have not been extensively studied. This study aims to characterize and compare the presence, phenotype, and frequency of islet-associated lymphocytes—specifically T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells—in patients with T2D and non-diabetic organ donors. Research design and methods Multicolor flow cytometry was employed to detect NK, B, and T cells in dissociated pancreatic islets from 13 T2D and 44 non-diabetic donors. The frequencies and phenotypes of T cell subsets were determined using markers for memory differentiation status and tissue-resident T cells. The frequencies of alpha and beta cells were assessed by flow cytometry, and the insulin secretion level was measured by ELISA. Results In both T2D and non-diabetic islets, CD3(+) T cells were the predominant lymphocytes, mainly central and effector memory phenotypes, with a bias toward CD8(+) T cells expressing canonical residency markers (CD69 and CD103). The frequencies of CD19(+) B cells and CD3(−) CD16(+) CD56(+) NK cells were low in both groups. The proportions of these immune and beta cells were similar between T2D and non-diabetic donors. However, T2D donors had a higher proportion of glucagon-producing alpha cells and significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared with non-diabetic individuals. Conclusions In T2D islets, resident CD8(+) T cells with a central memory phenotype dominate the lymphoid immune cell population, similar to non-diabetic donors. These findings provide the first insights into the memory T cell composition in human pancreatic islets in T2D, suggesting that the diabetic condition does not significantly alter the lymphoid landscape of pancreatic islets.">

        <tr id="The tumor-immune response is mobilized to suppress tumorigenesis, while the immune microenvironment and lymph node microenvironment are formed gradually during tumor progression. In fact, tumor surface antigens are not easily recognized by antigen-presenting cells. So it is hard for the immune system to kill the newly formed tumor cells effectively. In a normal immune environment, immune function is always suppressed to maintain the stability of the body, and regulatory T cells play an important role in maintaining immune suppression. However, during tumorigenesis, the suppression of regulatory T cell immune functions is more likely to contribute to tumor cell proliferation and migration leading directly to tumor progression. Therefore, focusing on the role of regulatory T cells in tumor immunity could improve tumor immunotherapy outcomes in the clinic. Regulatory T cells are more mature in hematologic system tumors than in solid tumors. However, there are continuing efforts to apply regulatory T cells for immunotherapy in solid tumors. This review describes the role of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy from the perspective of prognosis, immune microenvironment remodeling, and current clinical applications. This summary could help us better understand the mechanisms of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy and further expand their clinical application.">

        <tr id="Tumor-specific CD8+ T cells play a pivotal role in anti-tumor immunity. Here, we review the heterogeneity of CD8+ T cell subsets during tumor progression. While both acute and chronic viral infections induce distinct CD8+ T cell responses, chronic responses are also observed during tumor development. Chronic immune responses have traditionally been considered to represent a dysfunctional state of CD8+ T cells, whereas the identification of TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells has highlighted their importance in anti-tumor immunity. During tumor progression, TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells differentiate into cytotoxic Tim-3+ terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. We recently identified CD69 as an important regulator of chronic CD8+ T cell responses and showed that blocking CD69 function, either through the administration of anti-CD69 antibody (Ab) or genetic knockout, enhanced the generation of cytotoxic Tim-3+ terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells in both tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby enhancing the anti-tumor immune response. These findings suggest that CD69 is an attractive therapeutic target that controls the chronic anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response.">

        <tr id="Background Allergic asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by an allergic response and altered immune tolerance. CD4+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are crucial in the chronic and relapsing pathogenesis of asthma. Furthermore, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is an essential transcription factor involved in asthmatic tolerance and has been implicated in the regulation of CD4+CD44+ memory T cells. However, the role of CD4+ TRM cells in asthmatic tolerance, as well as their potential modulation by PLZF, remain unclear. Therefore, in the current study, we explore the role of CD4+ TRM cells in asthmatic immune tolerance and as well as the regulatory role of PLZF in this process. Methods To elucidate the role of CD4+ TRM cells in immune tolerance, asthma memory mouse models were treated with the immunomodulator FTY720. Subsequently, CD4+ T cells were isolated from the lungs and spleens and transferred to oral tolerance mouse models. To explore the regulation of PLZF in CD4+ TRM cells, asthma and oral tolerance were established in Zbtb16flox/flox CD4Cre and wild-type mice. Flow cytometry, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements were performed to characterize the immune response. The regulatory activity of PLZF on CD4+ TRM cells was analyzed through quantitative proteomics and verified in vitro and vivo. Results The CD4+ TRM cell proportion positively correlated with the pathological phenotypes and molecular characteristics of asthma. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ TRM cells induced asthmatic phenotypes. This suggested that CD4+ TRM cells contributed to the pathogenesis of asthma. Conditional knockout of PLZF substantially reduced the proportion of CD4+ TRM cells, relieved asthmatic symptoms, and suppressed the interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15Rα signaling pathway. Furthermore, exposure to the IL-15Rα agonist restored asthma-related Th2 inflammation, accompanied by a markedly increased proportion of CD4+ TRM cells. Meanwhile, IL-15 and ovalbumin(OVA)-primed Beas2b supernatant co-stimulation in vitro enhanced the differentiation of pulmonary PLZF-expressing CD4+ T cells into CD4+ TRM cells. Conclusions This study identified CD4+ TRM cells as key mediators of immune tolerance in asthma. This process is regulated by the transcription factor PLZF in CD4+ T cells through IL-15/IL-15Rα signaling. Thus, targeting PLZF or the IL-15/IL-15Rα pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating asthma.

        <tr id="Abstract Dysregulated innate immune responses contribute to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), characterized by gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, and/or cardiovascular injury occurring weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To investigate innate immune functions, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in fully convalescent children months after MIS-C recovery. When we investigated the genetic background of patients in relation to TLR responsiveness, we found that cells from MIS-C children carrying rare heterozygous variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Moreover, these rare LYST variant heterozygous carriers tended to exhibit unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation, including more profound lymphopenia. The results of our observational study have several implications. First, TLR hyporesponsiveness may be associated with hyperinflammation and/or excessive or prolonged stimulation with gut-originated TLR ligands. Second, TLR hyporesponsiveness during MIS-C may be protective, since LYST variant heterozygous carriers exhibited reduced TLR hyporesponsiveness and unfavorable clinical laboratory indicators of inflammation. Thus, links may exist between genetic background, ability to establish a refractory immune state, and MIS-C clinical spectrum. Third, the possibility exists that prolonged TLR hyporesponsiveness is one of the mechanisms driving long coronavirus disease (COVID), which highlights the need to monitor long-term consequences of MIS-C.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated disorders are a broad range of diseases, arising as consequence of immune defects, exaggerated/misguided immune response or a mixture of both conditions. Their frequency is on a rise in the developed societies and they pose a significant challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Traditional pharmacological, monoclonal antibody-based or polyclonal antibody replacement-based therapies aiming at modulation of the immune responses give very often dissatisfactory results and/or are burdened with unacceptable adverse effects. In recent years, a new group of treatment modalities has emerged, utilizing cells as living drugs, especially with the use of the up-to-date genetic engineering. These modern cellular therapies are designed to offer a high potential for more targeted, safe, durable, and personalized treatment options. This work briefly reviews the latest advances in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, mainly those related to exaggeration of the immune response, with such cellular therapies as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and others. We highlight the main features of these therapies as new treatment options for taming the dysregulated immune system. Undoubtfully, in near future such therapies can provide lasting remissions in a range of immune-mediated disorders with reduced treatment burden and improved quality of life for the patients.">

        <tr id="Proinflammatory signaling is a hallmark of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Several studies have shown that monocytes are a major source of proinflammatory cytokines and monocyte-derived fibrocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of myelofibrosis (MF). To further explore the role of monocytes in MF, we generated inducible NrasG12D/+Jak2V617F/+(NJ) mice. Recipients transplanted with NJ bone marrow cells developed MF with an early onset of anemia and monocytosis. In vitro, NJ recipients’ bone marrow nucleated cells exhibited increased quantity of CD45+CollagenI+ fibrocytes, which were mainly derived from the Ly6chigh monocytes. RNA sequencing identified a significant elevated expression of CD38 (a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+ hydrolase) in Ly6chigh monocytes from NJ mice, which results in pronounced lower level of NAD+. In humans, CD14+ monocytes from MF patients showed significantly higher expression of CD38 than controls and monocytes from polycythemia vera (PV) patients with grade 1 fibrosis had higher CD38 expression than those without fibrosis. Finally, we tested that boosting NAD+ via pharmacological CD38 targeting or NAD+ precursor supplementation inhibited the differentiation of fibrocytes in vitro and observed that targeting CD38 can effectively prevent the onset of fibrosis in vivo. Collectively, our findings shed light on the role of CD38 in monocytes and suggest potential clinical applications such as use of CD38 as a biomarker of fibrotic progression and potential clinical utility of CD38 inhibition in patients with MF. Key Points CD38-overexpressing monocytes are increased in MF murine models and MPN patients progressing to fibrotic-phase disease. Restoring intracellular NAD+ levels using the CD38 inhibitor 78c prevented the development of fibrotic-phase disease in MPN murine models.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

Evidence indicates that dynamic changes in TME during TKI treatment are associated with the development of resistance. Research has focused on identifying how each component of the TME interacts with tumors and TKIs to understand therapeutic targets that could address TKI resistance. In this review, we describe how TME components, such as immune cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, immune checkpoint proteins, and cytokines, interact with EGFR-mutant tumors and how they can promote resistance to TKIs.

        <tr id="Introduction. Immune memory is a tool of the adaptive immune system that allows it responding quickly and effectively to repeated contact with an antigen. The role of memory cell populations in the recurrence and progression of immune-dependent diseases is shown. 
Aim. To determine the trend in memory T-cell populations depending on the effectiveness of biological therapy (BT) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis (PS). 
Materials and methods. Four hundred fifty children with immunosuppressive diseases (ISD) were examined during different periods of administration of biological drugs: IBD — 162 children (infliximab /adalimumab), MS — 116 children (interferon β1α — IFNβ1α), PS — 172 children (adalimumab). The effectiveness of BT was assessed using clinical activity indices and functional methods. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry to determine populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell: central (TCM), effector (TEM), and terminally differentiated (TEMRA). Statistical data processing was carried out in the Statistica 16.0 program, using the Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05). In the SPSS version 25 software, ROC analysis was performed in the efficiency–inefficiency separation model. 
Results. In all forms of pathology, changes in the content of memory T-cells have been established depending on the activity of inflammation. In IBD and PS patients, with an increase in the indices of disease activity, a decrease in the levels of CD4+ naive T-cells (TNAIVE) and an increase of TCM were detected. In MS patients with active foci, an MRI scan showed a decrease in the percentage of naive CD8+ T-cells (TcytNAIVE) and an increase in the population of CD8+ TEM. The content of TNAIVE populations decreased with age, and memory T-cells increased in patients with all the studied forms of pathology. In patients with BT efficacy, a high content of TNAIVE populations and a low content of TCM were found compared with the levels in patients with insufficient BT efficacy. Thresholds have been determined for IBD, MS, and PS patients, which make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT. An increase in the levels of TNAIVE and TcytNAIVE makes it possible to predict the presence of a BT effect, an increase in the levels of TCM, CD4+ TEM, and CD8+ ТEMRA make it possible to predict the absence or insufficient effect of BT. 
Conclusion. The activity of the inflammatory process is reflected in the differentiation of populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. With the effectiveness of BT, the number of TNAIVE increases with a decrease in the number of TCM and TEM in patients with immune-dependent diseases, regardless of the form of pathology and the drug used. Threshold values for memory T-cells populations make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-17 receptor A (IL17RA) is a critical mediator of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and a key immune checkpoint in autoimmune diseases. While monoclonal antibodies targeting IL17RA have demonstrated clinical efficacy, their high costs, complexity in production, and lack of oral bioavailability present significant limitations. In response to these challenges, we developed AL-8(0), a novel peptide specifically designed to inhibit the IL17A-IL17RA signaling pathway. AL-8(0) was synthesized with high purity and systematically evaluated for its binding affinity and anti-inflammatory activity. Biophysical and cellular assays confirmed the peptide’s strong affinity for IL17RA and its ability to inhibit inflammatory cytokine production in IL17RA-expressing monocyte-macrophages and keratinocytes. Moreover, its anti-inflammatory effects were com-parable to IL17RA-targeting monoclonal antibodies and were dependent on IL17RA expression, as demonstrated by experiments using IL17RA-deficient cells. These results underscore AL-8(0)’s potential as a targeted therapeutic for autoimmune diseases, offering a peptide-based alternative with lower antigenicity, improved scalability, and potential for oral administration. This study lays the groundwork for further development of AL-8(0) and similar peptides as innovative treatments for inflammatory disorders driven by the IL17A-IL17RA pathway.

        <tr id="In the initial phase of infections, prior to the development of the follicular antibody response, an extrafollicular B cell response develops in lymphoid organs, with activation of cells displaying B cell receptors with low affinity to the different epitopes of the invading pathogen. To evaluate if this response allows early protection in the murine host, we investigated its role during infection with Sylvio X10/4 (a low virulence Trypanosoma cruzi parasite) of CD28KO mice, a mouse strain that does not develop a follicular antibody response, in parallel with infected C57BL/6 mice (used as control). We observed that T. cruzi infection allowed CD28KO mice to survive for a long period of time, ranging from a few weeks to almost a year. However, the CD28KO mice showed higher levels of subpatent parasitemia than C57BL/6 mice, as well as more intense and long-lasting inflammatory infiltrates in the heart. Following the CD28KO mice throughout the infection, we found a significant reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but not CD4+ T cells, as well as a strong fluctuation in the number of B cells. Meanwhile, although the production of IFN-γ in the spleen was not affected by CD28 deficiency, a reduction in IL-2 production was observed in anti-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T cells from infected CD28KO mice. Regarding the humoral response, after confirming that the T follicular helper (TFH) cells and germinal center B cells (GC-B) were absent in the infected CD28KO mice, we demonstrated that the extrafollicular antibodies, present in CD28KO infected mice, allowed an early protection in the murine host, since the transfer of serum from chronic CD28KO mice to naïve CD28KO mice, which were infected with T. cruzi 24 hours later, promoted a significant reduction in parasitemia. These results demonstrate that low-affinity anti-T cruzi extrafollicular antibodies contribute to the control of circulating parasites, allowing Sylvio X10/4-infected CD28KO mice to survive for a long time.

        <tr id="TRIMELVax is an innovative immunotherapeutic vaccine for malignant melanoma, which combines heat shock-conditioned human melanoma cell lysates with a mollusk hemocyanin as an adjuvant. Preclinical studies demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in mice with melanoma and colorectal tumors. However, the precise immunological mechanisms behind its anti-tumor effects have remained unclear. We focused on understanding how TRIMELVax induces inflammation at the injection site, recruits innate immune cells, triggers DC migration to draining lymph nodes, and affects tumor microenvironment and growth. To achieve this, C57BL/6 mice were injected in the footpad with TRIMELVax, PBS, or control vaccines, and then the skin and the popliteal lymph node were harvested for qPCR or FACS analysis. Results showed that TRIMELVax rapidly induced a specific pattern of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a differential acute innate immune response in the injection site. Neutrophils, type 1 macrophages, monocytes, cDC1, Langerhans cells, and monocyte derived-DCs were recruited to the footpad, while type 2 macrophages decreased. This early inflammation facilitated a superior migration of cDC1 and a new subtype of antigen-presenting neutrophils to the draining lymph node compared to controls. Depleting neutrophils before vaccination reduced DC migration, especially cDC1, to the draining lymph node and suppressed TRIMELVax's ability to control tumor growth, demonstrating that vaccine-induced neutrophils play a fundamental role in TRIMELVax's mechanism of action. At the tumor microenvironment level, it was observed that TRIMELVax induces a more intense infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes than controls, with a low level of exhaustiveness and greater cytotoxic capacity. A phase I clinical trial in twenty nivolumab-refractory patients showed that TRIMELVax is well tolerated with no grade 3-5 side effects and induces a Delayed-Type hypersensitivity reaction against melanoma antigens after four doses of the vaccine with an impact on disease stability and patient survival. In summary, TRIMELVax triggers a rapid and potent activation of the innate immune system, which seems crucial for a more effective adaptive immune response against aggressive melanoma tumors. These results underscore the promise of TRIMELVax as a potential immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease displaying heterogeneous symptoms. However, the association between the clinical heterogeneity of PsA and disease immunopathogenesis remains poorly understood complicating diagnostic precision. A knowledge gap remains on whether it is possible to distinguish the clinical PsA phenotypes on the immune cellular level. The primary aim of the study was to explore the differences in gene expression profiles comparing PsA patients without cutaneous psoriasis (PsA-only) and PsA patients with cutaneous psoriasis (PsA/PsC). The secondary aim was to describe the transcriptional patterns in PsA patients compared with healthy controls. Methods The study applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using the BD Rhapsody™ Single-Cell Analysis System to evaluate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 70 PsA patients and 10 healthy controls. Differential expression (DE) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were applied to evaluate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched signaling pathways, respectively. Results The DE analysis and GSEA comparing PsA-only and PsA/PsC patients with healthy controls, respectively, revealed divergent results involving both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, which might be associated with differences in the clinical phenotype. No DEGs were discovered in the direct comparison of PsA-only and PsA/PsC patients. Discussion The single-cell transcriptome profiling provided insight into the heterogeneity of PsA patients as the discovered DEGs and the GSEA did demonstrate differences in signaling associated with inflammation comparing PsA patients with and without cutaneous psoriasis.">

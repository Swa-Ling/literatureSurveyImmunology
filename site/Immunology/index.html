        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play pivotal roles in modulating therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. While B cells have traditionally been viewed as bystanders in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests they may actively influence anti-tumor immunity, albeit with conflicting reports regarding their pro-tumor or anti-tumor roles. This study explores the crucial roles played by B cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping melanoma responses to ICB therapy. We show a significant enrichment of B cells in ICB therapy responders compared to non-responders, pre-treatment, through retrospective analyses of melanoma patient tumors. Functional assays demonstrate that B cell depletion impairs T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, underscoring the importance of B cells in anti-tumor responses. To investigate the clinical relevance, EVs were isolated from melanoma patient tumors, and fractioned into tumor and immune subpopulations. MiRNA profiling of CD19+ EVs identifies miR-99a-5p as a top candidate, among several others, upregulated in responders. Functional assays show that miR-99a-5p silencing in B cells diminishes T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity, suggesting its role in promoting B cell-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p influences B cell maturation within the TME by mediating class-switch recombination. Our findings highlight the important role of B cells and their derived EVs in shaping the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell-related pathways.

        <tr id="Signal transduction downstream of activating stimuli controls CD8+ T cell biology, however these external inputs can become uncoupled from transcriptional regulation in Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders (PIRD). Gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 amplify cytokine signaling and cause a severe PIRD characterized by early onset autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections, and immune dysregulation. In both primary human and mouse models of STAT3 GOF, CD8+ T cells have been implicated as pathogenic drivers of autoimmunity. The molecular mechanisms by which STAT3 GOF variants drive this pathology remain unclear. We found that naïve CD8+ T cells have an increased capacity for IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion. Given this dysregulation of CD8+ T cell function, we evaluated changes in immunoregulatory pathways and found evidence of dysregulated purinergic signaling via high dimensional immune profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional assessment. Specifically, while expression of CD39, which transforms ATP to AMP, was increased on CD8+ T cells from patients with STAT3 GOF, downstream purinergic family members, CD73 and the adenosine receptor, A2AR, were downregulated, impairing the potential to produce or sense inhibitory adenosine. Patients with STAT3 GOF can be clinically treated with JAK inhibitors and this partially normalized naïve CD8+ T cell dysregulation, including aberrant cytokine production. The extent of normalization of cytokine secretion scaled with normalization of CD73 and A2AR. This suggests that a dysregulated purinergic signaling axis plays an important role in CD8+ T cell dysregulation in STAT3 GOF, which may have implications for other inflammatory disorders with amplified STAT signaling. One Sentence Summary Amplified STAT3 signaling in CD8+ T cells from STAT3 GOF patients alters purinergic signaling and dysregulates CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="The significance of endogenous immune surveillance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains controversial. Using clinical B-ALL samples and a novel mouse model, we show that neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells are induced to adopt type-1 regulatory (Tr1) function in the leukemia microenvironment. Tr1s then inhibit cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, preventing effective leukemia clearance. Leukemic cells induce Tr1s by phenocopying hematopoietic stem cells, which normally are subject to effective surveillance by this CD4+ subset. This mechanism effectively redirects Tr1 cells from a role in preventing cancer to maladaptively promoting clinical relapse. In mouse models, inhibition of Tr1 expansion with IL10 receptor (IL10R) blockade is insufficient to improve leukemia control. In contrast, combined therapy with a cytotoxic agent and anti-PDL1 blockade eradicated measurable residual disease. This correlates with polarization of the neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cell population from Tr1 towards Th1 states. Our findings uncover a mechanism that enables leukemic relapse and resolves existing controversies on the role of immune surveillance towards this cancer type. Therapeutic polarization of neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells towards Th1 states may improve contemporary immune therapies by reshaping the immune microenvironment towards states permissive for cytotoxic attack of residual leukemia. Key Points B-ALL induces neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells to adopt Type-1 regulatory states, which protect leukemic cells from immune pressure. Repolarizing neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cells towards Th1 states eradicates measurable residual disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction Our aim was to investigate the insufficiently understood differences in the immune system between anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive (ACPA+) and ACPA-negative (ACPA-) early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) patients. Methods We performed multiple cytokine assays using sera from drug-naïve ACPA+ and ACPA- eRA patients. Additionally, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45+ cells from peripheral blood samples to analyze and compare the distribution and functional characteristics of the cell subsets based on the ACPA status. Results Serum concentrations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-12 were higher in ACPA+ eRA than in ACPA- eRA. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of 37,318 cells identified 17 distinct cell types and revealed the expansion of IL1B+ proinflammatory monocytes, IL7R+ T cells, and CD8+ CCL4+ T cells in ACPA+ eRA. Furthermore, we observed an enrichment of IFN-γ response genes in nearly all monocytes and T cells of ACPA+ eRA subsets. Heightened interactions between IFN-γ and IFN-γ receptors were observed in ACPA+ eRA, particularly between monocytes and T cells. We examined IFITM2 and IFITM3 as potential key markers in ACPA+ eRA given their pronounced upregulation and association with the IFN response. Specifically, the expression of these genes was elevated in IL1B+ proinflammatory monocytes (likely M1 monocytes), correlating with serum IFN-γ levels. Discussion Compared to ACPA- eRA, ACPA+ eRA showed higher serum IFN-γ and IL-12 levels, upregulated IFN-γ response genes, and enhanced IFN-γ-driven monocyte-T cell interactions. These distinct immune features of the peripheral circulation in ACPA+ eRA suggest a role for type 1 helper T cell-related immunity in its pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR-T cell treatment remains incompletely understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analyses of bone marrow-resident immune cells from B-ALL patients before and after CAR T-cell treatment. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation, including an increase in myeloid cells. Significant induction of the IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells. PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response in the cohort of patients analyzed. Further, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell dysfunction. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells led to increased accumulation of human MDSCs, exacerbation of a hypoxic environment and T-cell exhaustion in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. In conclusion, CAR T-cell-mediated myeloid activation is associated with pathways of immune dysregulation that may antagonize the effects of therapy. Key points The tumor immune context post-treatment affects CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling result in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromise CAR T-cell efficacy.">

        <tr id="Single naive B cells amplify and diversify their responses when activated by cognate antigen, via Myc-dependent clonal expansion, immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), phenotypic variation, and somatic hypermutation (SHM). Whether these mechanisms act combinatorially in vivo to diversify clonal responses to a single complex pathogen remains unclear. Since diversity in the antigenic targets, functional classes, and production kinetics of parasite-specific antibodies influences immunity to malaria, we test here whether individual B cell clones diversify over time during Plasmodium infection and treatment. During the first week of infection, amid widespread Type I Interferon (IFN)-mediated, bystander activation, CSR initiates soon after Myc up-regulation. CSR then overlaps with clonal expansion, resulting in isotype variegation amongst certain clones. In the second week of infection, expanded clones seeding germinal centres (GC) both bifurcate into extra-follicular plasmablasts and exhibit isotype variegation, revealing substantial intra-clonal diversification. Over the following month, GC clones undergo SHM at approximately four mutations per week, with IgG mutational diversity and IgM+ cells preserved in GCs over time. Anti-malarial intervention does not impede SHM, but instead exerts quantitative limits on GC size, plasma cell emergence and circulating antibody titres. Finally, we reveal a contemporaneous B cell developmental pathway that relocates from bone marrow to the spleen during infection and treatment. Thus, multiple temporally overlapping mechanisms combine in vivo to amplify, diversify, and safeguard humoral immune responses. Graphical abstract Highlights Early temporal overlap of CSR with clonal expansion leads to isotype variegation in clones. Clones seeding GCs bifurcate into plasmablasts and exhibit isotype variegation. GC B cells accrue mutations at rates unaffected by anti-malarials. Plasmodium infection triggers antigen-independent Type I IFN-mediated bystander activation. B cell development is preserved in malaria by shifting from bone marrow to spleen.">

        <tr id="Host immunity in sepsis has features of hyperinflammation together with progressive immunosuppression, particularly among CD4 T cells, that can predispose to secondary infections and ineffectual organ recovery. Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

        <tr id="The success of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies targeting solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate that endowing CAR T cells with ectopic interleukin-9 (IL-9) signaling by co-expressing an IL-9 receptor, rewires CAR T cell fate under antigen stress to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. In preclinical solid tumor models, IL-9-signaling CAR T cells exhibit increased expansion, persistence, and tumor infiltration, resulting in superior tumor control at significantly lower doses than conventional products. Trajectory and RNA velocity analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that IL-9 signaling alters CAR T cell differentiation under antigen stress away from dysfunction, favoring a multipotent transition toward CD8+ cell memory and effector states, and promoting a CD4+ cell proliferative state. Interrogation of transcription factor pathways indicates that IL-9-mediated activation of STAT1 and STAT4 drives the superior phenotype of IL-9-signaling CAR T cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting solid cancers.">

        <tr id="Cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly monocytes and macrophages, play a key role in HIV infection by contributing to viral replication, immune response, and maintaining immune balance during suppressive therapy. We hypothesized that metabolic reprogramming and altered chemokine signaling in people living with HIV (PWH) on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) affect monocyte transport and polarization due to ongoing inflammation. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the mechanism of impaired monocyte/macrophage function in PWH on well-treated ART that can lead to clinical intervention strategies to improve health. Single-cell RNA sequencing, immune-phenotyping, and metabolic modeling identified altered expression of chemokine and metabolite receptors and altered metabolic flux in PWH monocytes that decreased monocyte migration. The plasma secretome revealed a nonclassical inflammatory microenvironment in PWH. Integrative multi-omics and single-cell proteomics of differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) detected metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by α-ketoglutarate (AKG) that affected macrophage function and HIV infection. Increased levels of AKG in plasma were shown to occur in PWH under ART. Therefore, when differentiating MDM with serum from PWH or AKG, macrophage function was found polarized towards an M2-like state. AKG alone was shown to increase CCR5 levels and increase HIV-1 infection in MDM. Here, we utilize systems biology-driven identification and ex vivo assays to show impaired macrophage polarization, due to metabolic training, can leads to a low-grade nonclassical inflammatory environment in well-treated PWH.">

        <tr id="Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized immune cell aggregates that arise in chronic inflammatory conditions. In cancer, TLS are associated with better prognosis and enhanced response to immunotherapy, making these structures attractive therapeutic targets. However, the mechanisms regulating TLS formation and maintenance in cancer are incompletely understood. Using spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging across various human tumors, we found an enrichment of mature dendritic cells (DC) expressing high levels of CCR7 in TLS, prompting us to investigate the role of DC in the formation and maintenance of TLS in solid tumors. To address this, we developed a novel murine model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that forms mature TLS, containing B cell follicles with germinal centers and T cell zones with T follicular helper cells (TFH) and TCF1+PD-1+ progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tpex). Here we show that, during the early stages of tumor development, TLS formation relies on IFNγ-driven maturation of the conventional DC type 1 (cDC1) subset, their migration to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLN), and recruitment of activated T cells to the tumor site. As tumors progress, TLS maintenance becomes independent of T cell egress from tdLN, coinciding with a significant reduction of cDC1 migration to tdLN. Instead, mature cDC1 accumulate within intratumoral CCR7 ligand-enriched stromal hubs. Notably, timed depletion of cDC1 or disruption of their migration to these stromal hubs after TLS are formed alters TLS maintenance. Importantly, we found that cDC1-mediated antigen presentation to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and intact CD40 signaling, is critical for the maintenance of TLS, the preservation of the TFH cell pool, the formation of germinal center and the production of tumor-specific IgG antibodies. These findings underscore the key role of mature cDC1 in establishing and maintaining functional TLS within tumor lesions and highlight the potential for cDC1-targeting therapies as a promising strategy to enhance TLS function and improve anti-tumor immunity in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="While CD20 was initially characterized as a B cell-specific marker, its expression on memory T cells has expanded our understanding of this molecule’s distribution and function. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized CD20-expressing NK cell population and demonstrate its functional significance. CD56+CD20+ NK cells exhibit hallmarks of cellular activation, including elevated NKp46, CD69, and CD137 expression, enhanced proliferative capacity, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-10). Functional analyses revealed enhanced cytotoxicity against K562 targets, correlating with increased expression of cytolytic mediators including granzymes A, B, and K, perforin, FASL, and TRAIL. Single-cell transcriptional profiling demonstrated that MS4A1-expressing NK cells possess a distinct molecular signature characterized by elevated granzyme K expression and memory-like features. These cells preferentially localize to secondary lymphoid organs and accumulate in inflammatory tissues. Notably, CD56+CD20+ NK cells are enriched in multiple inflammatory conditions, including multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. Treatment with rituximab depletes this population, suggesting potential therapeutic implications. Our findings establish CD20+ NK cells as a functionally distinct lymphocyte subset with enhanced effector capabilities and tissue-homing properties, providing new insights into immune regulation in inflammatory diseases.

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical for immunosurveillance yet become dysfunctional in contexts such as chronic stimulation by viral infections or cancer. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Tumor clearance by T cells is impaired by insufficient tumor antigen recognition, insufficient tumor infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance by these T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promises to reverse T cell suppression in the TME and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. CPIs require the target pathway of inhibition to be active in the TME to elicit a therapeutic response. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of serial killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function against HR+ cancers. Our model provides a means to optimize targets for CPIs used in combination with BATs in clinical strategies. What is already known on this topic Bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapies are adoptive T cell therapies that can effectively reroute T cell cytotoxicity toward cancerous cells, but lack consistent and durable anti-tumor responses. Checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of activated T cells dampen immune responses and can be overstimulated in solid tumors to hamper tumor clearance by T cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs can improve T cell anti-tumor response by blocking checkpoint protein signaling but are only effective if the targeted checkpoint protein is expressed on the T cell and activated in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an opportunity to enhance BAT efficacy by combining treatment with synergistic CPI. What this study adds This study characterizes dynamic, time-resolved patterns in checkpoint protein expression by breast cancer-targeting adoptive T cells and predicts the significance of high-prevalence checkpoint proteins on T cell function. It also demonstrates the use of multivariate statistic and mathematical modeling toward rational design of targets and timing strategies for synergistic combination therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy The output of this study provides justification for therapeutic strategies combining adoptive T cell therapies with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting TIGIT and LAG3 as a means of improving patient responses in HER2-/HR+ breast cancers.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for over a million deaths annually. Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-γ timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-γ exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced anti-mycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial clearance. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function. Author Summary Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a major global health threat. While most people exposed to MTB successfully fight off the infection, some individuals develop active disease. Understanding how the bacteria evade immune defenses is key to developing better treatments. In this study, we identify a new role for c-Myc, a protein well-known in cancer research, in suppressing the ability of immune cells called macrophages to fight MTB. Macrophages are responsible for engulfing and killing bacteria, but we found that c-Myc interferes with this process, allowing MTB to survive. Using a small peptide inhibitor called Omomyc, we were able to block c-Myc activity, which restored macrophages’ ability to kill MTB. This effect is linked to changes in cellular metabolism, leading to the increased production of molecules essential for bacterial destruction. We also discovered that high c-Myc levels are associated with persistent MTB infection in both mouse models and human tissues. This suggests that c-Myc helps the bacteria evade immune attack, contributing to long-term infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism exploited by MTB to survive in the body and suggest that targeting c-Myc could be a promising approach to enhancing immune defenses against TB. By bridging insights from cancer biology and infectious disease research, our work provides a new perspective on tackling TB and highlights c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for boosting immunity against this deadly infection.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are critical regulators of HIV immunity, but the mechanisms behind their expansion and value as a therapeutic target remain unclear. We investigated MDSC function in HIV using a humanized mouse model. Acute HIV-1 infection triggered the systemic expansion of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), with their frequency correlating positively with plasma viral load. Notably, PMN-MDSC expansion increased further when natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were depleted, suggesting these immune cells restrain MDSC proliferation. We identified Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis as a regulatory mechanism, as MDSCs expressed high levels of TRAIL receptor 2 (R2), while NK cells and CTLs upregulated TRAIL expression during HIV infection. Treating HIV-1-infected mice with a TRAIL-R2 agonist significantly reduced MDSC levels to those of uninfected mice and significantly improved NK cell and CTL immune function. Crucially, in viremic humanized mice, the treatment prevented CD4+ T cell loss, a hallmark of HIV-1 pathogenesis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting MDSC apoptosis to mitigate CD4+ T cell depletion and enhance HIV-specific immunity, offering a new clinical target to prevent AIDS and insights into MDSC– NK/CTL cross-regulation during HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Crosstalk between autophagy, host cell death, and inflammatory host responses to bacterial pathogens enables effective innate immune responses that limit bacterial growth while minimizing coincidental host damage. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) thwarts innate immune defense mechanisms in alveolar macrophages (AMs) during the initial stages of infection and in recruited bone marrow-derived cells during later stages of infection. However, how protective inflammatory responses are achieved during Mtb infection and the variation of the response in different macrophage subtypes remain obscure. Here, we show that the autophagy receptor Tax1bp1 plays a critical role in enhancing inflammatory cytokine production and increasing the susceptibility of mice to Mtb infection. Surprisingly, although Tax1bp1 restricts Mtb growth during infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Budzik et al. 2020) and terminates cytokine production in response to cytokine stimulation or viral infection, Tax1bp1 instead promotes Mtb growth in AMs, neutrophils, and a subset of recruited monocyte-derived cells from the bone marrow. Tax1bp1 also leads to increases in bacterial growth and inflammatory responses during infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular pathogen that is not effectively targeted to canonical autophagy. In Mtb-infected AMs but not BMDMs, Tax1bp1 enhances necrotic-like cell death early after infection, reprogramming the mode of host cell death to favor Mtb replication in AMs. Tax1bp1’s impact on host cell death is a mechanism that explains Tax1bp1’s cell type-specific role in the control of Mtb growth. Similar to Tax1bp1-deficiency in AMs, the expression of phosphosite-deficient Tax1bp1 restricts Mtb growth. Together, these results show that Tax1bp1 plays a crucial role in linking the regulation of autophagy, cell death, and pro-inflammatory host responses and enhancing susceptibility to bacterial infection. Author Summary Although macrophages are the first innate immune cells to encounter Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection, M. tuberculosis has evolved the ability to persist in them. Recent studies highlight that some types of macrophages are more permissive to M. tuberculosis replication and survival than others, but the mechanisms for cell type-specific differences in M. tuberculosis growth are only beginning to be understood. We found that the host factor, Tax1bp1 (Tax-1 binding protein 1), supports M. tuberculosis growth during animal infection and in specific subsets of innate immune cells, including alveolar macrophages while restricting M. tuberculosis in bone marrow-derived macrophages. We also found that Tax1bp1 has a similar phenotype in enhancing the pathogenesis of another intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes. Compared to bone marrow-derived macrophages, in alveolar macrophages, Tax1bp1 enhances the release of inflammatory mediators and leads to necrotic-like host cell death, which is known to enhance M. tuberculosis growth. Phosphorylation of Tax1bp1 in alveolar macrophages promotes M. tuberculosis growth. Our research highlights that Tax1bp1 is a host target for host-directed therapy against M. tuberculosis and controls host responses to M. tuberculosis in a cell type-specific manner.">

This highlights the needs to develop novel therapy for HIV-1 related diseases in PWH. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of CD24-Fc, a fusion protein with anti-inflammatory properties that interacts with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and siglec-10, in chronic HIV-1 infection model using humanized mice undergoing suppressive cART. Our findings show that CD24-Fc treatment significantly reduced inflammation and immune hyperactivation in vivo when combined with cART. CD24-Fc mediated resolution of inflammation was associated with improved recovery of CD4 T cells, reduced immune activation, restored central memory T cells and reversal of immune cell exhaustion phenotype. Notably, CD24-Fc treatment rescued CXCR5+ CD8 central memory T cell (TCM) which correlated with increased polyfunctionality in HIV-specific T cells in humanized mice and in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWH. This restoration of CXCR5+ memory CD8 T cells was associated with HIV replication inhibition, delayed viral rebound and reduced HIV-1 pathogenesis upon cART cessation. This study suggests that CD24-Fc treatment could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for managing chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH. Author summary Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) cannot block viral gene expression from activated HIV proviral DNA in reservoir cells, contributing to chronic immune activation and inflammation associated diseases in people with HIV (PWH).

Thus, CD24-Fc could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells, unstimulated or ex vivo stimulated with Mtb, for 7 PWH who were TST & IGRA positive (called LTBI) and 6 who were persistently TST & IGRA negative (called resisters). Alveolar macrophages (AM) from resisters displayed a baseline M1 macrophage phenotype while AM from LTBI did not. Resisters displayed alveolar lymphocytosis, with enrichment of all T cell subpopulations including IFNG-expressing cells. In both groups, mycobactericidal granulysin was expressed almost exclusively by a T cell subtype that co-expressed granzyme B, perforin and NK cell receptors. These poly-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) over-expressed activating NK cell receptors and were increased in resister BAL. Following challenge with Mtb, only Intraepithelial Lymphocytes-like cells from LTBI participants responded with increased transcription of IFNG. AM from resisters responded with a stronger TNF signature at 6h post-infection while at 24h post-infection AM from LTBI displayed a stronger IFN-γ signature. Conversely, at 24h post-infection only AM from resisters displayed a significant upregulation of MICA transcripts which encode an activating ligand for poly-CTL. These results suggest that poly-CTL and AM mediate the resister phenotype in PWH.">

        <tr id="Abstract Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune condition which causes significant morbidity in children and young adults and is more severe in its presentation than adult-onset SLE. While many aspects of immune dysfunction have been studied extensively in adult-onset SLE, there is limited and contradictory evidence of how cytotoxic CD8+ T cells contribute to disease pathogenesis and studies exploring cytotoxicity in JSLE are virtually non-existent. Here, we report that CD8+ T cell cytotoxic capacity is reduced in JSLE versus healthy controls, irrespective of treatment or disease activity. Transcriptomic and serum metabolomic analysis identified that this reduction in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in JSLE was associated with upregulated type I interferon (IFN) signalling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances when compared to controls. Greater interrogation of the influence of these pathways on altered cytotoxic CD8+ T cell function demonstrated that JSLE CD8+ T cells had enlarged mitochondria and enhanced sensitivity to IFN-α leading to selective apoptosis of effector memory (EM) CD8+ T cells, which are enriched for cytotoxic mediator-expressing cells. This process ultimately contributes to the observed reduction in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity in JSLE, reinforcing the growing evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathogenic factor affecting multiple immune cell populations in type I IFN-driven rheumatic diseases.">

        <tr id="Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that in humans can be broadly classified into two main subtypes based on their unique TCRδ chain, Vδ1 and Vδ2. Both subsets have potent anti-tumor properties and the presence of Vδ1 cells in the tumor is often associated with positive prognosis. Herein, we investigated the molecular interplay between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), IC blockade (ICB) therapy and γδ T cells. We show that ICRs display differential expression and regulation by the JAK-STAT pathway in circulating Vδ1 and Vδ2 cells and identify constitutive (e.g. TIGIT, PD-1) and inducible (e.g. TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4) ICRs. In melanoma, Vδ1 cells, especially in patients who did not respond to ICB or required combination therapy, expressed high levels of ICR, TOX and inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) transcripts, reminiscent of an exhaustion transcriptional signature. At the same time all γδ T cells had a prominent downregulation in AP-1 transcription factors. Patient derived cells were functionally competent, although induction of LAG-3 and CTLA-4 was impaired. In the context of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Vδ1 cells specifically bound high levels of therapeutic antibody but only in patients who responded to treatment, revealing a potential new prognostic marker for evaluating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Finally, expression of KIR genes in Vδ1 cells was downregulated in response to successful ICB therapy. Collectively, our data indicate an intricate relationship between ICRs, putatively also KIRs, and γδ T cells and reveal novel approaches by which these cells can be harnessed in order to discern or improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Viral vectors have successfully modified T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), leading to clinical approvals. However, their high cost and regulatory challenges hinder rapid and broad clinical translation. Here, we demonstrate that our lentivirally (LV) manufactured R110-CAR T cells, targeting a leukemia neoepitope, can also be engineered using non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition with minimal-sized DNA vectors. Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing was used to compare the two production modes using healthy donor and CLL patient-derived T cells and a CD19-CAR T cell control. SB products were shifted towards CD8+ subsets with expression of activation/co-inhibition markers (CD69, LAG-3, TIM-3) despite their naïve-like phenotype and lack of antigenic challenge. The CAR binding moiety modulated these patterns with R110-CAR T cells showing more aberrant phenotypes. Moreover, SB engineering resulted in inflammatory signatures along with RIG-I-like and TOLL-like nucleotide sensing potentially resulting from the transfection procedure. Patient-derived products showed significantly fewer CAR-expressing cells, reduced proliferation clusters, and lower T cell diversity, particularly with SB manufacturing, pointing at potential challenges with this method when engineering CLL T cells. Together, our data suggest that the engineering mode may substantially influence T cell properties and that these are further modulated by the CAR binding moiety and the type of T cell donor.">

        <tr id="Radiation is used to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the locally-advanced setting. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), in particular, has shown improved outcomes against conventional RT in a number of clinical trials. One key cell type involved in the response to RT are neutrophils. These innate immune cells are the first responders to tissue damage and infiltrate irradiated tumors in high numbers to rectify injury. Neutrophils typically possess an immunosuppressive, wound healing phenotype in this scenario, which allows the tumor to recover and actively suppress immunological efforts to eradicate the disease. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of neutrophils in a murine model of PDAC treated with SBRT. Mice harboring PDAC tumors were treated with targeted SBRT and neutrophils were determined to be significantly increased in the tissue when compared to unirradiated controls. Additionally, phenotypic analysis determined that these cells were largely immunosuppressive and depletion studies confirmed they played a key role in acquired radioresistance in our model. In order to establish whether these infiltrating cells could be re-wired to contribute to anti-tumor immunity, we utilized a novel combination therapy consisting of SBRT and microspheres containing recombinant IL-12 to attempt to repolarize these cells. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed intratumoral neutrophils underwent considerable changes indicative of an immunostimulatory, anti-tumor phenotype following treatment. Moreover, depleting these cells resulted in a loss of treatment efficacy, suggesting that neutrophil re-wiring was vital for the therapeutic outcome. This study highlights neutrophils as key players in SBRT and IL-12 treatment and confirms they can act as a double-edged sword depending on the treatment employed.">

        <tr id="Patients with cancer often receive chemotherapy to control tumor progression and reduce disease symptoms. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents not only kill rapidly growing cancer cells but also reduce normal cells including myeloid cells, the main innate immune population involved in fighting infections and repairing tissue damages. Rapid loss of myeloid cells caused by chemotherapy triggers myelopoiesis, a process in which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow regenerate myeloid cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, to reconstitute the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported that chemotherapy with an alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice leads to repopulation of myeloid cells that acquire immunosuppressive activities within the monocyte subset. However, detailed information on the cellular composition and molecular identity of these chemotherapy- induced immunosuppressive monocytes is lacking. Here, we investigated how the various myeloid cell subsets in the bone marrow of mice respond to CTX chemotherapy through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq). We found that myeloid progenitor cells and monocytes were reduced 2 days after chemotherapy but rebounded and surpassed their pretreatment levels by day 7. Further scRNAseq analysis of pre-enriched monocytes revealed that the monocyte population was heterogenous, and that chemotherapy tilted myelopoiesis towards the production of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo). We identified Cxcr4 and Cx3cr1 as suitable markers for isolation of chemotherapy-induced NeuMo and demonstrated that these cells were suppressive to T cells. Together with the evidence that CTX-induced monocytes can promote breast cancer metastasis in mice, our data reveal the heterogeneity of the monocytes reemerging after chemotherapy and identify the NeuMo subset as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer.">

We herein studied tumor progression and response to treatment using an immunocompetent murine model. scRNAseq analysis revealed that paclitaxel treatment altered tumor cell phenotypes, favoring tumor cells with a gene expression signature indicative of active NF-κB pathway with secretory phenotype. Treatment coincidently reduced IFN-I signature cells during tumor progression. The resulting secretory shift correlated with neutrophil recruitment to the tumor, particularly CXCR2+ neutrophils, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 receptor by navarixin reactivated antitumor immunity, enhancing NK cell infiltration and tumor cytotoxicity. Navarixin combination with paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor volume and metastasis. Targeting the NF-κB-driven secretory phenotype, in particular through neutrophil modulation, holds promise for improving TNBC treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune cells determine the role of the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression, either suppressing tumor formation or promoting tumorigenesis. We analyzed the profile of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of control mouse skins and skin tumors at the single-cell level. We identified 15 CD45+ immune cell clusters, which broadly represent the most functionally characterized immune cell types including macrophages, Langerhans cells (LC), conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2), migratory/mature dendritic cells (mDC), dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC), dermal γδ T cells (γδT), T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer cells (NK), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), neutrophils (Neu), mast cells (Mast), and two proliferating populations (Prolif.1 and Prolif.2). Skin tumor progression reprogramed immune cells and led to a marked increase in the relative percentages of macrophages, cDC2, mDC, Tregs, and Neu. Macrophages, the largest cell cluster of immune cells in skin tumors. In addition, macrophages emerged as the predominant communication ‘hub’ in skin tumors, highlighting the importance of macrophages during skin tumor progression. In contrast, other immune cell clusters decreased during skin tumor progression, including DETC, γδT, ILC2, and LC. In addition, skin tumor progression dramatically upregulated Jak2/Stat3 expression and the interferon response across various immune cell clusters. Further, skin tumor progression activated T cells and NK cells indicated by elevated expression of IFN-γ and Granzyme B in skin tumors. Meanwhile, a pronounced infiltration of M2-macrophages and Tregs in skin tumors created an immunosuppressive microenvironment, consistent with the elevated expression of the Stat3 pathway in skin tumors. In summary, our study elucidates the immune cell landscape of epidermal neoplasms, offering a comprehensive understanding of the immune response during skin tumor progression and providing new insights into cancer immune evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Relapsed and refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (rrDLBCL) presents a significant challenge in hematology-oncology, with approximately 30-40% of DLBCL patients experiencing relapse or resistance to treatment. This underscores the urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms governing therapeutic resistance. Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 6 (STAT6) has been previously identified as a gene with recurrent D419 gain-of-function mutations in rrDLCBL. When STAT6D419 mutations are present in DLBCL tumour cells, we have demonstrated that transcription of the chemokine CCL17 (aka TARC) is increased, and tumours have increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells. However, the significance of increased T cell infiltration had not been determined. In the present study, we developed a mouse model of STAT6D419N mutant DLBCL, that recapitulates the critical features of human STAT6D419 mutant DLBCL, including increased expression of phospho-STAT6, increased CD4+ T cell invasion, and resistance to doxorubicin treatment. With this model, we found CD4+ T cells in STAT6D419N tumours have higher expression of the receptor for CCL17, CCR4. Using ex vivo functional assays we demonstrate that STAT6D419N tumour cells are directly chemoattractive to CCR4+ CD4+ T cells, and when CCR4 is inhibited using a small molecule antagonist, CD4+ T cells in STAT6D419N tumours are reduced and STAT6D419N tumours regain therapeutic sensitivity to doxorubicin. Using PhenoCycler imaging of human rrDLBCL samples, we find that STAT6D419 tumours indeed have increased expression of phospho-STAT6+ and increased cellular interactions between phospho-STAT6+ tumour cells and CD4+/ CCR4+ CD4+ T cells. Thus, our data identify CCR4 as an attractive therapeutic target in STAT6D419 mutant rrDLBCL.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) rarely respond to ICB. Accumulating evidence indicates that the complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacts the efficacy of ICB therapy. Therefore, investigating how TME components in MM influence ICB treatment is urgent. Methods We employed two well-established murine myeloma models, 5TGM1 and Vk*MYC, by intravenously injecting 5TGM1 or Vk*MYC cells into mice, respectively, to determine ICB therapeutic efficacy in MM. Total mouse IgG or Ig2b ELISA or QuickGel split beta SPE kits and in vivo bioluminescent imaging were used to monitor MM tumor burden. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) was used to quantify MM TME components. T cell proliferation and function were detected using flow cytometry. Peptide-Fc fusion proteins were used to deplete myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MMDTR, Foxp3DTR, CD4 KO and CD8 KO mice were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Gene expression levels in human MM were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus public datasets. Results We found that programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody treatment had a therapeutic effect in 5TGM1 mice; it was ineffective in Vk*MYC mice. CyTOF indicated that the bone marrow (BM) of both models was inflamed, suggesting that immune suppressive cells might be inhibiting the reactivation of T cells in the BM. We observed higher numbers of MDSCs, regulatory T (Treg) cells, and tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) in myeloma BM compared with that of tumor-free mice. Specifically, depleting MDSCs, but not Treg cells or TAMs, sensitized Vk*MYC mice and enhanced the response of 5TGM1 mice to PD-1 ICB, which was dependent on CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells. MDSCs, especially M-MDSCs and CD84+ MDSCs, significantly inhibited the activation and cytotoxic cytokine production of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Moreover, database profiling of patient BM revealed a negative correlation between MDSCs signature genes and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell signature genes, with post-maintenance patients with myeloma displaying a higher ratio of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell to MDSCs signature genes compared with pretreated patients. Conclusion Our study highlights the potential of MDSCs depletion in enhancing the sensitivity of patients with myeloma to PD-1 ICB therapy.">

        <tr id="While most people contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, some individuals develop active disease, usually within two years of infection. Why immunity fails after initially controlling infection is unknown. C57BL/6 mice control Mycobacterium tuberculosis for up to a year but ultimately succumb to disease. We hypothesize that the development of CD4 T cell dysfunction permits bacterial recrudescence. We developed a reductionist model to assess antigen-specific T cells during chronic infection and found evidence of CD4 T cell senescence and exhaustion. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 T cells upregulate coinhibitory receptors and lose effector cytokine production. Single cell RNAseq shows that only a small number of CD4 T cells in the lungs of chronically infected mice are polyfunctional. While the origin and causal relationship between T- cell dysfunction and recrudescence remains uncertain, we propose T cell dysfunction leads to a feed-forward loop that causes increased bacillary numbers, greater T cell dysfunction, and progressive disease.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cell senescence has been linked to repeated antigen stimulation. However, how different types of chronic antigenic exposures impact T cell differentiation and function remains incompletely understood. Using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) as models for persistent stimulation in autoimmunity and chronic viral infection, we performed high-dimensional mass cytometry analyses to examine their effects on CD4+ T cell differentiation. We found that CMV seropositive adults have a significant population of highly differentiated CD27-CD28-CD4+ T cells that exhibited common features of senescence, including CD57 and cytotoxic granule expression. In contrast, CD27-CD28-CD4+ T cells were rare in RA patients and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or Herpes simplex virus (HSV) seropositive individuals. The few that were present exhibited a predominantly non-cytotoxic profile, with higher expression of TCF1, CD127, and Ki67. Among CMV seropositive individuals, RA was associated with reduced degranulation of cytotoxic granules and lower cytokine production by senescent CD4+ T cells. We did not find an association with age, sex, clinical characteristics, or medication usage by univariate linear regression analyses. However, in vitro tofacitinib treatment reduced T cell functional activity, suggesting contributions from both the disease and RA treatment. These data uncovered distinct influences from CMV and RA, and their combined impact on senescent CD4+ T cell differentiation and function.">

        <tr id="Ly49+ CD8 T cells are memory-phenotype (MP) cells expressing Ly49 family inhibitory receptors, that control autoimmune diseases development through the regulation of follicular CD4 T cells. During viral infection, their number increases, suggesting an involvement in antiviral responses. These cells do not derive from naive cells and are thought to develop in the thymus. This study identified two subsets of Ly49+ CD8 T cells, based on CD8β expression, in mice and humans. Lineage tracing and reliance on the transcription factor Zeb1 indicate a thymic origin via agonist selection. scRNAseq analysis revealed that a small fraction of CD8αβ-Ly49+ cells acquired an effector profile during vaccinia virus infection. Moreover, the majority of Ly49+ CD8 T cells seems to respond to cytokine-driven bystander signals. In vitro, these signals promoted the expression of effector molecules such as IFNγ and granzyme B, as well as the homing chemokine receptor CXCR5, potentially driving their recruitment to germinal centers. Summary This study shows that Ly49+ CD8 T cells comprises two subsets that develop in the thymus through agonist selection. In viral infection, both subsets respond to bystander stimuli that could drive their regulatory activity. Furthermore, some CD8αβ-expressing Ly49+ cells exert TCR-mediated antiviral response.">

This selects for latently infected cells, but also potentially for cells that express HIV but possess intrinsic CTL resistance. We demonstrate that such resistance exists in HIV-infected CD4+ T-cells that survive rigorous CTL attack and map CTL susceptibility to cell identities and states defined by single-cell multi-omics and functional metabolic profiling. Cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells were prominently overrepresented amongst survivors, as were cells with quiescent metabolic profiles and low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The induction of ROS production by treatment with deferoxamine sensitized these cells to CTL-mediated elimination. Reservoir-harboring cells from clinical samples share the above transcriptional features, being enriched for quiescent states. Our results provide an atlas for elucidating features of CTL resistance in HIV reservoirs, and identify oxidative stress as a therapeutic target to facilitate reservoir elimination.">

The immense potential MSC-EVs hold as tumour-targeted therapeutics warrants an understanding of potential adverse events to support clinical translation. This study aimed to determine whether MSC-EVs would elicit an immune response following administration in tumour-bearing immunocompetent animals. Secreted EVs were isolated from both human and murine bone marrow derived MSCs and characterized. hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs were administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour-bearing Balb/c mice or healthy controls. Tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and flow cytometry performed targeting T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The 4T1 model immune profile was first determined by comparing the spleen of tumour-bearing animals to healthy controls. T cells were increased in tumour-bearing animals (CD4+/CD25+ p=0.041; CD8+/CD25+ p=0.02). A significant elevation of GR-1+ MDSCs (p=0.002), CD11b+ macrophages (p=0.023) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (p=0.001) was also observed. In contrast, CD27+ NK cells were significantly decreased compared to the spleen of healthy animals (p=0.006). Collectively this data validated the immune profile and supported the determination of any changes in response to hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs administration. No significant activation of CD4+ (p=0.20) or CD8+ (p=0.57) T cells were seen in tumour tissue in both groups. The percentage of GR-1+ MDSCs (28% vs 27%, p=0.92), CD11b+, CD11c+ and CD27+ cells were similar regardless of EV origin. No significant changes in T cells, MDSCs, macrophages, dendritic or NK cells were observed in the lymph node or spleen of animals that received hMSC-EV versus mMSC-EVs. In conclusion, human MSC-EVs elicited no discernible immune response in mice, supporting the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune privilege of the secretory cell. This reinforces the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a critical role in suppressing anti-tumor immunity, often resulting in unfavorable clinical outcomes across numerous cancers. However, systemic Treg depletion, while augmenting anti-tumor responses, also triggers detrimental autoimmune disorders. Thus, dissecting the mechanisms by which Treg cells navigate and exert their functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is pivotal for devising innovative Treg-centric cancer therapies. Our study highlights the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARδ), a nuclear hormone receptor involved in fatty acid metabolism. Remarkably, PPARδ ablation in Treg escalated tumor growth and augmented the immunosuppressive characteristics of the TME. This absence of PPARδ spurred an increased expression of genes central to antigen presentation, notably CIITA and MHC II. Our results showcase a novel association where the absence of CIITA in PPARδ-deficient Treg bolsters anti-tumor responses, casting CIITA as a pivotal downstream regulator of PPARδ within Treg. In vitro assays demonstrated that elevated CIITA levels enhance the suppressive capacity of Treg, facilitated by an antigen-independent interaction between Treg-MHC II and Tconv-TCR/CD4/Lag3. A significant revelation was the role of type 1 interferon as a TME signal that promotes the genesis of MHC II+ Treg; PPARδ deficiency intensifies this phenomenon by amplifying type 1 interferon signaling, mediated by a notable upsurge in JAK3 transcription and an increase of pSTAT1-Y701. In conclusion, the co-regulation between TME cues and PPARδ signaling shapes the adaptive and suppressive roles of Treg cells through the CIITA-MHC II pathway. Strategically targeting the potent MHC II+ Treg population could open a new avenue for cancer therapies by boosting anti-tumor defenses while curbing autoimmune threats. Highlights PPARδ Treg conditional knockout mice show accelerated tumor growth due to increased expression of CIITA-MHC II. Type I interferon signal regulates Treg CIITA-MHC II axis in vitro and in vivo. PPARδ attenuates Type I interferon response and restrains CIITA-MHC II expression in Treg cells. Treg suppressive function is enhanced by Treg MHC II’s direct interaction with TCR/CD4/Lag3 on Teff cells.">

        <tr id="Persistent alloantigens derived from allograft tissues can be recognized by the host’s alloreactive immune system. This process enables cognate B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, which secrete donor-specific antibodies that are key drivers of antibody-mediated allograft rejection. A subset of these plasma cells can survive for extended periods in a suitable survival niche and mature into long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), which are a cellular component of humoral memory. The current understanding of LLPCs is limited due to their scarcity, heterogeneity, and absence of unique markers. However, accumulating evidence indicates that LLPCs, unlike conventional short-lived plasma cells, can respond to extrinsic signals from their survival niches and can resist cell death associated with intracellular stress through cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Notably, they are refractory to traditional immunosuppressants and B cell depletion therapies. This resistance, coupled with their longevity, may explain why current treatments targeting antibody-mediated rejection are often ineffective. This review offers insights into the biology of LLPCs and discusses ongoing therapeutic trials that target LLPCs in the context of antibody-mediated allograft rejection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immunotherapy that targets immune checkpoints has achieved revolutionary success, but its application in solid tumors remains limited, highlighting the need for reliable enhancement of the efficacy of immunotherapy. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a Golgi membrane protein, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including immune regulation. Recent studies suggested that GP73 may play a role in modulating the immune response in patients with cancer. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which GP73 regulates T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment. Methods We used T-cell specific GP73 knockout mice to establish MC38 and B16 tumor models to investigate the impact of GP73-deficient T cells on tumor growth. Single-cell sequencing was subsequently employed to classify tumor-infiltrating immune cells and assess changes in cytokines and metabolic genes. Through RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, seahorse analysis, glucose uptake, and L-lactic acid secretion assays, we explored how GP73 regulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) to influence T-cell antitumor functionality. Furthermore, we established adoptive transfer experiments to study the ability of GP73-overexpressing T cells to combat tumors. Blood samples of patient with clinical tumor were collected to assess the relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and T-cell GP73 levels. Results In this study, the absence of GP73 in mouse T cells promoted tumor growth and metastasis, accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+T cell subsets infiltrating the tumor and an increase in exhausted CD8+ T-cell subsets. Further analysis revealed that the effector function of CD8+T cells in tumors relies on glycolysis regulated by HIF-1α rather than immune checkpoints. GP73-deficient T cells exhibit severely impaired glycolysis in hypoxic environments, whereas ectopic GP73 expression restores HIF-1α levels. In adoptive immunotherapy, overexpression of GP73 in T cells inhibits tumor growth. In cytotoxicity assays, knockdown of GP73 affected the ability of CD8+T cells to kill target cells. Clinically, tumor immunotherapy partial response patients present significantly elevated levels of GP73 expression in T cells. Conclusions These findings reveal the role of GP73 in regulating T-cell glycolysis and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the prognosis and treatment of clinical tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Ovarian cancer (OC) is the sixth most common malignancy in women and the poor 5-year survival emphasises the need for novel therapies. NK cells play an important role in the control of malignant disease but the nature of tumour-infiltrating and peripheral NK cells in OC remains unclear. Methods Using flow cytometric analysis, we studied the phenotype and function of NK cells in blood, primary tumour and metastatic tissue in 80 women with OC. The cell type contexture of metastatic OC tissue was explored utilising scRNAseq analysis, with a focus on portraying an immunogenic tumour microenvironment and determining the characteristics of a dysfunctional NK cell population. Results The proportion of peripheral NK cells was markedly elevated with a highly activated profile and increased cytotoxicity. In contrast, NK cell numbers in primary tumour and metastasis were substantially reduced, with downregulation of activatory receptors together with elevated PD-1 expression. scRNA-Seq identified 5 NK cell subpopulations along with increased exhausted and immature NK cells within tumour tissue compared to normal tissue. These features were attenuated following chemotherapy where higher levels of activated and cytotoxic NK cells associated with improved disease-free survival. Correlation of NK cell phenotype with clinical outcomes revealed high levels of DNAM-1 expression on tissue-localised and peripheral NK cells to be associated with reduced survival. Expression of PVR, the DNAM-1 ligand, was significantly increased on tumours and DNAM-1 mediated NK cell lysis of primary tumour tissue was observed in vitro. Discussion These findings reveal profound modulation of the tumour tissue and systemic profile of NK cells which likely contributes to the high rates of local progression and metastasis seen with OC. Immunotherapeutic approaches that overcome local immune suppression and enhance DNAM-1-targeted lysis of OC offer the potential to improve disease control.">

        <tr id="The discovery of immune checkpoints and the rapid growth of immuno-oncology (IO) have sparked tremendous efforts to utilize the immune system to treat a wide range of cancer types/subtypes. While the major focus of IO over the past decades has been to manipulate the adaptive immune system, recent attention has been given to manipulating the innate immune system to treat cancer and/or to enhance adaptive responses. In this work we detail the intracellular protein, Dual Specificity Phosphatase 11 (DUSP11), as an innate immune checkpoint (iIC) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of this atypical phosphatase is correlated with patient survival for multiple cancer types, and we show here that its activity is important for the viability of lung cancer cells in vitro. Specifically, we demonstrate that DUSP11 knockdown in LUAD cells induces apoptosis and an innate immune response capable of activating other cells in vitro, and we provide evidence that these phenotypes are primarily mediated by the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). Finally, we show that expression of DUSP11 is important for tumor engraftment and growth of human LUAD in mice. Overall, these data are the first to establish DUSP11 as an immunosuppressive, pro-neoplastic, and potentially targetable protein in LUAD. In addition, our data suggests that the anti-cancer mechanisms induced by diminishing the activity of DUSP11 are likely to be generalizable to other cancer types such as breast cancer, warranting future investigation and therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="T cells play an important role in anti-tumor immunity. Its subset that contains the surface receptor CD8, also called cytotoxic T cells, functions to facilitate tumor cell elimination. Chronic exposure of CD8+ T cells to antigens and inflammation can cause the T cells to lose their functions as well as changes in their surface expressions, named T cell exhaustion (Tex). This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of this cellular process and the influence of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on it. This article focuses on the mechanism of action of the four major upregulated immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) and introduces ICB therapies targeting each ICP. Based on these mechanisms, scientists have suggested various interventions to reverse T-cell exhaustion. Recent clinical data show that although ICB therapy has significant efficacy in some patients, its limitations in patient selection limit the popularization of the treatment effect. ICB which curbs Tex by blocking the signal pathways that suppress T cell functions, summarizes the current understandings and progress, and identifies the gaps on this topic.">

        <tr id="Antibody production is central to protection against new pathogens and cancers, as well as to certain forms of autoimmunity. Antibodies often originate in the lymph node (LN), specifically at the extrafollicular border of B cell follicles, where T and B lymphocytes physically interact to drive B cell maturation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts. In vitro models of this process are sorely needed to predict aspects of the human immune response. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) offer the opportunity to approximate the lymphoid environment, but so far have focused primarily on memory recall responses to antigens previously encountered by donor cells. To date, no 3D culture system has replicated the engagement between T cells and B cells (T—B interaction) that leads to antibody production when starting with naïve cells. Here, we developed a LN-MPS to model early T—B interactions at the extrafollicular border built from primary, naïve human lymphocytes encapsulated within a collagen-based 3D matrix. Within the MPS, naïve T cells exhibited CCL21-dependent chemotaxis and chemokinesis as predicted. Naïve T and B cells were successfully skewed on chip to an early T follicular helper (pre-Tfh) and activated state, respectively, and co-culture of the latter cells led to CD38+ plasmablast cells and T cell dependent production of IgM. These responses required differentiation of the T cells into pre-Tfhs, physical cell-cell contact, and were sensitive to the ratio at which pre-Tfh and activated B cells were seeded on-chip. Dependence on T cell engagement was greatest at a 1:5 T:B ratio, while cell proliferation and CD38+ signal was greatest at a 1:1 T:B ratio. Furthermore, plasmablast formation was established starting from naïve T and B cells on-chip. We envision that this MPS model of primary lymphocyte physiology will enable new mechanistic analyses of human humoral immunity in vitro.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally, with an increased death rate despite recent advancements in research and therapeutic options. Different molecular subtypes of GC have distinct interactions with the immune system, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME), prognosis, and reaction to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME are crucial for preventing tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by research showing that patients with GC who have a significant density of TILs have better survival rates. But cancer cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, both sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) playing a pivotal role in the development of an immunosuppressive TME. They prevent T cell activation and proliferation resulting in a decrease in the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. These immune checkpoint molecules function via different but complementary mechanisms, the expression of Siglec-15 being mutually exclusive with PD-L1 and, therefore, providing a different therapeutic approach. The review explores how TILs affect tumor growth and patient outcomes in GC, with particular emphasis on their interactions within the TME and potential targeting of the PD-L1 and Siglec-15 pathways for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="While the majority of ovarian cancer (OC) patients respond to front-line carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy and surgical debulking, nearly all patients will develop platinum-resistance and recur. Our study investigates how tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) affect chemotherapy outcomes using OC patient-derived organoids and humanized patient-derived xenografts (huPDX). In vitro macrophage migration assays demonstrate the selective recruitment of M2 polarized macrophages to OC organoids. M2 macrophages, but not M1 macrophages, increase OC organoid viability and reduce their sensitivity to paclitaxel in co-culture assays. Furthermore, we identified BMS777607, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that is capable of repolarizing M2 macrophages in vitro and reduces organoid viability by a macrophage-dependent mechanism. In a platinum-sensitive humanized patient-derived xenograft (huPDX) model, the presence of human immune cells increased between-mouse variability in response to paclitaxel with two of four mice demonstrating tumor regrowth after two weeks of treatment. A TAM-targeted CSF-1R inhibitor, BLZ945 significantly reduced the total number of human immune cells within the ascites fluid of huPDX3 mice, but did not reduce tumor burden. However BLZ945 in combination with paclitaxel reduced tumor burden with no sign of regrowth. Our study demonstrates that patient-derived OC organoids and huPDX, are useful for evaluating the immunomodulatory effects of therapies and the influence of TAMs on response. huPDX models could serve as a robust platform for preclinical testing of novel anti-cancer treatments, providing insights into the complex interplay between immune cells and cancer therapeutics.">

How interactions of these two systems influence tumor development and clinical outcomes remains incompletely understood. To address this challenge, we developed the multi-omics analysis framework PACIFIC to systematically integrate genetic cancer drivers and infiltration profiles of immune cells with clinical information. In an analysis of 8500 cancer samples, we report 34 immunogenomic interactions (IGXs) in 13 cancer types in which context-specific combinations of genomic alterations and immune cell activities associate with disease outcomes. Risk associations of IGXs are potentially explained by tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental metrics of immunogenicity and differential expression of therapeutic targets. In luminal-A breast cancer, MEN1 deletion combined with reduced neutrophils is associated with poor prognosis and deregulation of immune signalling pathways. These findings help elucidate how cancer drivers interact with TME to contribute to tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.">

        <tr id="Peritoneal tissue-resident macrophages, also referred to as large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs), play an important role as gatekeepers of peritoneal homeostasis by providing a first line of defense against pathogenic threats. About a third of the LPMs express the surface receptor V-set and Immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4), but it is unclear to what extent these cells differ from their VSIG4-negative counterparts and perform dedicated functions. Here, we demonstrate that VSIG4+ LPMs, in contrast to VSIG4- LPMs, are in majority derived from embryonal precursors and their occurrence is to a large extent independent from sex and microbiota. Although their transcriptome and surface proteome are indistinguishable from VSIG4- LPMs at steady-state, VSIG4+ LPMs are superior in phagocytosing Gram-positive bacteria and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. In-house generated anti-VSIG4 nanobody constructs that are antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enabled allowed a selective elimination of the VSIG4+ LPM subset without affecting the overall LPM content of the peritoneal cavity. This strategy uncovered a role for VSIG4+ LPMs in lowering the first peak of parasitemia in a Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection model and in reducing the outgrowth of CRC cells in the peritoneal cavity, a prime metastatic site in CRC patients. Altogether, our data uncover a protective role for VSIG4+ LPMs in infectious and oncological diseases in the peritoneal cavity.">

        <tr id="PARP inhibitors sensitize pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to radiation by inducing DNA damage and replication stress. These mechanisms also have the potential to enhance radiation-induced type I interferon (T1IFN)-mediated antitumoral immune responses. We hypothesized that the PARP inhibitor olaparib would also potentiate radiation-induced T1IFN to promote antitumor immune responses and sensitization of otherwise resistant PDAC to immunotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of olaparib and radiation on T1IFN production and sensitivity to αPD-L1 immunotherapy, as well as on the tumor microenvironment by single-cell RNA sequencing. We found that olaparib enhanced T1IFN production after radiation and had superior therapeutic efficacy in immunocompetent models. Olaparib and radiation treatment sensitized PDAC tumors to αPD-L1, resulting in decreased tumor burden and a 33% complete response rate. Combination treatment provided durable immune responses as shown by tumor rejection upon tumor rechallenge of previously cured mice. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that combination treatment induced an immunogenic tumor microenvironment characterized by interferon (IFN) responses in both PDAC and myeloid cell populations, macrophage polarization, and increased CD8+ terminal effector T-cell frequency and activity, findings which were confirmed by IHC and flow cytometry. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells and T1IFN signaling were required for therapeutic efficacy as host depletion of CD8+ T cells or the T1IFN receptor diminished treatment responses. Overall, our results indicate that olaparib enhances radiation-induced T1IFN-mediated immune signaling and subsequently an adaptive immune response, thus sensitizing pancreatic cancer to αPD-L1 therapy, supporting an ongoing clinical trial of this therapy in patients with PDAC.">

        <tr id="Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) is a host-restriction factor that plays multiple roles in the antiviral defense of innate immune responses, including the inhibition of viral particle release from virus-infected cells. BST2 may also be involved in the endothelial adhesion and migration of monocytes, but its importance in the immune system is still unclear. Immune cell adhesion and migration are closely related to the initiation of immune responses. In this study, we found that the expressions of the lymph node homing marker chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and an adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were associated with BST2 expression. Interestingly, Bst2−/− cDCs showed lower chemotactic ability, including velocity and accumulative distance toward chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19) gradient in vitro, compared to wild-type cDCs. Bst2−/− cDCs also showed reduced migration and reduced retention capacity in draining lymph nodes in vivo. As a result, Bst2−/− cDCs as antigen-presenting cells induced lower antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses compared to Bst2+/+ cDCs. Notably, mice administered the influenza vaccine via Bst2−/− cDCs exhibited substantially inefficient virus clearance compared to mice administered the Bst2+/+ cDCs vaccine. Therefore, we propose that BST2, which plays a critical role in the effective migration and retention of cDCs, is involved in the development of optimal immunological effects in draining lymph nodes.">

        <tr id="Feedback control of erythropoiesis exemplifies conflicting goals in tissue homeostasis: maintaining fast reactivity to stress while minimizing proliferative burden on progenitors in the steady state. Here we show that these conflicting goals are tuned through the combinatorial action of cytokines. We find that IL-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, mediates striking synergism with the negative feedback signal erythropoietin (Epo) in vivo, accelerating the erythropoietic response to hypoxia. A model of erythropoietic control shows increased reactivity may occur through two cell circuit designs, with one having far lower constitutive progenitor burden in normoxia. IL-17A acts through this optimal design by sensitizing progenitors to Epo, a model supported by multiple experimental observations. We suggest that IL-17A signals impending hypoxia during infections, tuning erythropoiesis in favor of a faster stress response. Our study highlights IL-17A as a potential erythropoietic therapeutic agent and serves as a model of homeostatic tuning in stem and progenitor cell circuits.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Adaptive immune resistance in cancer describes the various mechanisms by which tumors adapt to evade anti-tumor immune responses. IFN-γ induction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was the first defined and validated adaptive immune resistance mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to adaptive immune resistance as immune modulatory secreted and integral membrane proteins are dependent on ER. Sigma1 is a unique ligand-regulated integral membrane scaffolding protein enriched in the ER of cancer cells. PD-L1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is translated into the ER and processed through the cellular secretory pathway. At the cell surface, PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint molecule that binds PD-1 on activated T-cells and blocks anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 can also be incorporated into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), and EV-associated PD-L1 can inactivate T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that a selective small molecule inhibitor of Sigma1 can block IFN-γ mediated adaptive immune resistance in part by altering the incorporation of PD-L1 into cancer cell-derived EVs. Sigma1 inhibition blocked post-translational maturation of PD-L1 downstream of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling. Subsequently, EVs released in response to IFN-γ stimulation were significantly less potent suppressors of T-cell activation. These results suggest that by reducing tumor derived immune suppressive EVs, Sigma1 inhibition may promote antitumor immunity. Sigma1 modulation presents a novel approach to regulating the tumor immune microenvironment by altering the content and production of EVs. Altogether, these data support the notion that Sigma1 may play a role in adaptive immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that develops in the bone marrow (BM) and the second-most-common blood cancer. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are emerging cytolytic immune effectors showing potent antitumor activity. In MM patients, ILC2s from peripheral blood possessed a cytotoxic arsenal, enabling them to kill MM cells via DNAM-1. In contrast, ILC2 resident in BM did not exert anti-myeloma activity, and instead became more susceptible to apoptosis. Specifically, MM cells led to ILC2 cell death by inducing and engaging the inhibitory receptor TIGIT. Collectively, ILC2s from MM patients displayed an imbalance in the DNAM-1/TIGIT axis, resulting in the conversion from a cytolytic to an exhausted profile. These findings support the employment of anti-TIGIT mAb to restore the survival and antitumor effects of ILC2s in MM.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Oligodendrocytes (OL) and their myelin-forming processes are targeted and lost during the disease course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), targeted by infiltrating leukocytes and their effector cytokines. Myelin repair is considered to be dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The basis of failure of re-myelination during the disease course of MS remains to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor ⍰ (TNF⍰) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the differentiation of human OPCs. Methods We generated human OPCs from induced pluripotent stem cells with a reporter gene under the OL-specific transcription factor SOX10. We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes in human, and heterogeneous neutrophils have been increasingly recognized as important players in tumor progression. They play double “edge-sward” by either supporting or suppressing the tumor growth, including driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling to promote tumor growth, participating in antitumor adaptive immunity, or killing tumor cells directly to inhibit the tumor growth. The complex role of neutrophils in various tumors depends on the tumor microenvironment (TME) they are located, and emerging evidence has suggested that neutrophils may determine the success of tumor immunotherapy in the context of the immune checkpoint blockade, innate immune training, or drug-loaded extracellular microvesicles therapy, which makes them become an exciting target for tumor immunotherapy, but still with challenges. Here, we summarize the latest insights on how to activate neutrophils in antitumor immunity and discuss the advances of neutrophil-targeted immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids. SUMMARY The neurotropic Usutu virus can cause encephalitis driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, microglia activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which are inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment.">

In vitro, exposure to hypoxia or genetic HIF2α activation promoted Th2 cell differentiation, even under non-polarizing conditions. In mice, HIF2α activation in CD4+ T cells promoted intestinal Th2 cell accumulation in the absence of infection, and HIF2α-deficiency impaired CD4+ T cell-mediated host immunity to intestinal helminth infection.

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents significant clinical challenges due to its limited treatment options and aggressive behavior, often associated with poor prognosis. This study focuses on Kindlin-2, an adaptor protein, and its role in TNBC progression, particularly in hematopoiesis-mediated immune evasion. TNBC tumors expressing high levels of Kindlin-2 induce a notable reshaping of hematopoiesis, promoting expansion of myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. This shift correlated with increased levels of neutrophils and monocytes in tumor-bearing mice over time. Conversely, genetic knockout of Kindlin-2 mitigated this myeloid bias and fostered T cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, indicating Kindlin-2's pivotal role in immune modulation. Further investigations revealed that Kindlin-2 deficiency led to reduced expression of PD-L1, a critical immune checkpoint inhibitor, in TNBC tumors. This molecular change sensitized Kindlin-2-deficient tumors to host anti-tumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression in immune-competent mouse models. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, and immunohistochemistry data supported these findings by highlighting enriched immune-related pathways and increased infiltration of immune cells in Kindlin-2-deficient tumors. Therapeutically, targeting PD-L1 in Kindlin-2-expressing TNBC tumors effectively inhibited tumor growth, akin to the effects observed with genetic Kindlin-2 knockout or PD-L1-KO. Our data underscore Kindlin-2 as a promising therapeutic target in combination with immune checkpoint blockade to bolster anti-tumor immunity and counteract resistance mechanisms typical of TNBC and other immune evasive solid tumors. Implications: Kindlin-2 regulates tumor immune evasion through the systemic modulation of hematopoiesis and PD-L1 expression, which warrants therapeutic targeting of Kindlin-2 in TNBC patients.">

 Failure to respond to the anti-α4β7 integrin therapy, vedolizumab, is observed in a subset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, potentially linked to distinct T cell activation profiles. This study aims to characterize the transcriptional and phenotypic features of circulating memory CD4⁺ T cells in vedolizumab non-responders and their association with treatment resistance.



 We performed multidimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze IBD patients' circulating memory CD4⁺ T cell compartment, comparing pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood samples from vedolizumab responders and non-responders. Proteogenomic analysis and TCR repertoire profiling of CD4⁺ T cells were conducted using matched peripheral blood samples. Flow cytometry characterized T cell subsets based on surface markers, migration receptors, transcription factors, and cytokine expression, focusing on differences in activation and migration profiles.



 Ki67⁺ cells were enriched in the memory CD4⁺ T cell population of vedolizumab non-responders in both UC and CD, confirmed by two independent cohorts. TCR repertoire analysis showed increased diversity in memory CD4⁺ T cells post-treatment. Single-cell sequencing and proteomics revealed these Ki67⁺ cells had a high activation and proliferation profile (HLA-DR, CD40LG, MKI67) with reduced IL7R and SELL expression. They displayed elevated integrins (α4, β1, β7) and gut-homing receptors (CXCR3, CCR6). Upregulated T-bet, EOMES, and RORγt and increased IL-17A, indicated a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotype in non-responders.



 Ki67⁺ memory CD4⁺ T cells are significantly enriched in the peripheral blood of vedolizumab non-responders, displaying a distinct transcriptional and phenotypic profile characterized by Th1/Th17 polarization, high integrin α4β1 expression, and enhanced gut-homing capacity. These findings indicate that proliferating effector memory CD4⁺ T cells could contribute to therapy resistance in IBD, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic strategies targeting these cells in anti-α4β7 integrin therapy non-responders.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of IFN-γ and a cytokine mix (5MIX: IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, OsM, and TNF-α) on the antigen-presenting capabilities of keratinocytes, with a specific focus on immune-mediated dermatological conditions such as psoriasis (Ps). To achieve this, keratinocytes were treated with IFN-γ and 5MIX, and their impact on the expression of key antigen-presentation molecules, HLA-DRα and CD74, was assessed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IFN-γ alone altered the expression of 254 genes, highlighting its central role in modulating immune responses, including the recruitment of immune cells and regulation of inflammation. Temporal experiments further demonstrated that IFN-γ and 5MIX enhanced early endocytic activity and lysosomal degradation pathways, both essential for effective antigen presentation and T-cell activation. To extend these findings to a clinical context, a co-culture model using keratinocytes derived from psoriatic patients was established. This model revealed increased cytokine production following antigen stimulation, indicating robust and consistent CD4+ and naïve T-cell responses. These results elucidate the complex dynamics of cytokine signaling and antigen presentation in keratinocytes, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated skin disorders like Ps.">

Even though HLA expression in neuroblastoma is low and immune cell infiltrates are limited, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is indicative for better patient survival. Here, we show that most tumor lesions contain viable immune cell infiltrates after induction chemotherapy, with high percentages of CD3+ T cells. We therefore expanded the TILs and tested their anti-tumoral activity. With sufficient starting material, TIL expansion was as efficient as for adult solid tumors. However, whereas TIL products from adult tumors almost exclusively contained αβ T cells, in neuroblastoma-derived TILs, γδ T cells expanded with similar efficacy as αβ T cells. Importantly, the anti-tumor responses in response to autologous tumor digest primarily originated from (Vδ1- and Vδ3-expressing) γδ T cells, and not from αβ T cells. In conclusion, this finding creates a window of opportunity for immunotherapy for neuroblastoma patients, with γδ T cells as potential prime responders.">

        <tr id="Introduction T-lymphopenia (TLP) is a frequently observed condition in cancer patients, often exacerbated by conventional chemo/radiotherapy, which impairs the efficacy of subsequent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. This study aimed to understand the impact of TLP on ICB responsiveness and explore potential therapeutic strategies to enhance antitumor immunity. Methods To investigate ICB responsiveness depending on the severity of TLP, first, we established TLP mouse models that mimic clinically observed mild and severe TLP through thymectomy and anti-Thy1-induced peripheral T cell depletion. T cell-replete mice and T-lymphopenic mice were inoculated with palpable or advanced tumors to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy according to the severity of TLP. Additionally, by utilizing established murine models, we analyzed matched blood, tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and tumor samples by flow cytometry to investigate the mechanisms by which ICB responsiveness is impaired under T-lymphopenic conditions. Finally, to evaluate the combination effect of anti-PD-1 and recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc) in T-lymphopenic conditions, we administered anti-PD-1, rhIL-7-hyFc, or both to advanced tumor-bearing T-lymphopenic mice and subsequently analyzed tumor growth and survival rates. Results Using mouse models mimicking clinical TLP, we observed that the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy was severely impaired in TLP, depending on the degree of TLP and the immunogenicity of the tumors. TLP mice showed a significant reduction in systemic CD8 T cells but stable intratumoral CD8 T cell numbers, suggesting maintained tumor infiltration despite systemic downregulation. Crucially, TLP led to a shift in the composition of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with a decrease in PD-1+ tumor-reactive CD8 T cells and an increase in PD-1− bystander cells. This reduction in PD-1+ cells was linked to impaired clonal expansion in tumor-draining lymph nodes. To counteract these effects, we introduced recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc), which effectively restored systemic T cell counts, enhanced PD-1+ CD8 T cell proliferation within tumors, and increased the population of stem-like progenitor cells. The combination of rhIL-7-hyFc and anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in significant tumor regression and improved mouse survival. Discussion Our findings highlight the critical role of IL-7 in reshaping the CD8 T cell landscape to improve ICB efficacy in TLP conditions, proposing a sequential therapeutic approach: conventional therapy to reduce tumor burden and enhance immunogenicity, followed by IL-7 therapy to restore and rejuvenate CD8 T cells, culminating in effective ICB treatment.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of adaptive immunity, guiding T helper (Th) cell differentiation through antigen presentation, co-stimulation, and cytokine production. However, in steady-state conditions, certain DC subsets, such as Langerhans cells (LCs), induce T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and B cell responses without inflammatory stimuli. Using multiple mouse models and in vitro systems, we investigated the mechanisms underlying steady-state LC-induced adaptive immune responses. We found that LCs drive germinal center Tfh and B cell differentiation and antibody production independently of interleukin-6 (IL-6), type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand (ICOS-L) signaling, which are critical in inflammatory settings. Instead, these responses relied on CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation. Our findings challenge the conventional three-signal paradigm by demonstrating that cytokine signaling is dispensable for LC-mediated Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state. These insights provide a framework for understanding homeostatic immunity and the immune system’s role in maintaining tolerance or developing autoimmunity under non-inflammatory conditions. SUMMARY STATEMENT Langerhans cells (LCs) drive germinal center Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state conditions independently of IL-6, type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand, challenging the established cytokine-centric model of T cell differentiation.">

        <tr id="The dialogue between T and B cells can be regulated by different mechanisms, such as co-inhibitory receptors, which therefore play a crucial role in preventing autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on many myeloid and lymphoid cells. Although peripheral B cells express a very high amount of BTLA, previous works in the context of autoimmunity mainly focused on T cells, and whether BTLA expression on B cells plays a role in the lupus pathogenesis is still unclear. In the present study, we examine the expression of BTLA, as well as its ligand HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator), on various B cell subsets in lupus patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). We evidenced the existence of double-negative (DN; IgD−CD27−) memory B cells expressing very low levels of BTLA, which are enhanced in active lupus patients. An in-depth analysis revealed that these BTLAlow DN cells mainly correspond to the newly reported DN3 B cell subset, originally described in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection. These cells display an activated and antibody-secreting cell phenotype, and we propose that their low BTLA expression may favor their expansion and rapid differentiation into plasmablasts in lupus patients.">

        <tr id="Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature, immune suppressive myeloid cells. However, their role in periodontal disease (PD), a microbially induced inflammatory oral disease, remains understudied. Here we show that gingiva (gums) from PD patients exhibit significantly higher levels of MDSC markers including Granulocytic (G)-MDSC and Monocytic (M)-MDSC subsets as well as CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells. Gingival MDSC subsets exhibit potent immunoregulatory activity as marked by attenuated autologous CD4+ T cells proliferation and IFNγ production. In a murine model of ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP), we noticed time-dependent gingival MDSC infiltration, which correlates with CD4+ T cell and CD19+ B cell infiltration. To test whether MDSC confer immunoregulatory function in vivo, we adoptively transferred G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in mice. Interestingly, we observed significant reduction in inflammatory marker expression (IL6, TNF-α, and IL-1β), infiltration of CD4+ T cells, and concomitant increase in MDSC-derived immune suppressive molecules, ARG1 and IL-10, and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs compared to mock. Conversely, depletion of MDSC using anti-Gr1 antibody resulted in marked induction of periodontal inflammation, reduced Treg population, and significantly higher alveolar bone loss. These findings, for the first time, suggest an anti-inflammatory and osteoprotective function of MDSCs in PD and offer a promising target to treat unresolved periodontal inflammation.">

Taking that three-dimensional (3D) cultures enhance MSCs’ anti-inflammatory properties compared with two-dimensional (2D) cultures, the differentially expressed miRNAs were examined. Thus, we identified hsa-miR-4662a-5p (miR-4662a) as a key inducer of IDO-1 via its suppression of bridging integrator-1 (BIN-1), a negative regulator of the IDO-1 gene. The IDO-1-inducing potential of miR-4662a was conserved across primary MSCs from various donors and sources but exhibited variability. Notably, iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) demonstrated superior IDO-1 induction and immune-modulatory efficacy compared with their donor-matched primary MSCs. Accordingly, iMSCs expressing miR-4662a (4662a/iMSC) exhibited stronger suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation and more potent suppressive effects on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), improving survival rates and reducing tissue damage in the liver and gut. Our results point to the therapeutic potential of standardized, off-the-shelf 4662a/iMSC as a robust immune-modulating cell therapy for GVHD.">

Despite intensive research and the use of new therapeutic options such as immunotherapy, the 5-year survival rate is not higher than 50% for male individuals, meanly affected by HNSCC, and has not been significantly improved over the last 20 years. The immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is characteristic of head and neck tumors (HNCs), contributes significantly to the failure of new therapy concepts. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify pro- and anti-tumorigenic immune cell populations in the HNSCC tumor environment with a special focus on the B cell subsets, as recent data assign B lymphocytes a significant contribution to tumorigenesis. In addition to an increase in anti-tumorigenic germinal center (GC) B cells, we describe here for the first time the population of marginal zone (MZ) B cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of HNSCC with pro-tumorigenic potential.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common lethal cancers worldwide. Natural killer cells (NK cells) play a key role in liver immunosurveillance, but in the tumor microenvironment, NK cells are readily depleted, as evidenced by down-regulation of activating receptors, reduced cytokine secretion, and attenuated killing function. The up-regulation of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, further exacerbates the depletion of NK cells. Combined blockade strategies targeting these immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with other inhibitory pathways (eg. TIM-3 and LAG-3), have shown potential to reverse NK cell exhaustion in preclinical studies. This article explores the promise of these innovative strategies in HCC immunotherapy, providing new therapeutic directions for optimizing NK cell function and improving drug sensitivity.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing plasma viremia in people living with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), persistent viral RNA expression in tissue reservoirs is observed and can contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathology and comorbidities. Infection of long-lived innate immune cells, such as tissue-resident macrophages and microglia may contribute to persistent viral RNA production and chronic inflammation. We recently reported that de-novo cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA) in macrophages and microglia leads to MDA5 and MAVS-dependent innate immune sensing and induction of type I IFN responses, demonstrating that HIV icRNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this report, we show that cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 icRNA also induces NLRP1 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages and microglia in a RLR- and endosomal TLR-independent manner. Infection of both macrophages and microglia with either replication-competent or single-cycle HIV-1 induced IL-1β secretion, which was attenuated when cytoplasmic expression of viral icRNA was prevented. While IL-1β secretion was blocked by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitors or knockdown of NLRP1 or caspase-1 expression in HIV- infected macrophages, overexpression of NLRP1 significantly enhanced IL-1β secretion in an HIV-icRNA-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of HIV-1 icRNA, but not multiply-spliced HIV-1 RNA, with NLRP1, suggesting that HIV-1 icRNA sensing by NLRP1 is sufficient to trigger inflammasome activation. Together, these findings reveal a pathway of NLRP1 inflammasome activation induced by de novo expressed HIV icRNA in HIV- infected myeloid cells.">

Bacteria interact with immune cells at the sites of intestinal inflammation, but also in the CRC tumor microenvironment1–6. Indeed, bacterial remnants have recently been detected in human intestinal tissue in patients with IBD, at primary tumor sites and in the metastases of patients with CRC, and in whole blood3,7,8. A defective intestinal epithelial barrier is thought to promote bacterial remnant translocation and disease progression6. However, it is unknown, how bacterial remnants translocate from the intestine to sites of metastasis or into the circulation. We hypothesized that bacterial remnants translocate within peripheral blood immune cells into the circulation. Here, we thus explored the composition of the detectable microbiome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with CRC or IBD compared to healthy controls. The PBMC microbiome profiles partially align with the tumor- and metastasis-derived or intestinal tissue-derived microbiome signatures obtained from the same patients with CRC or IBD, respectively. Our metagenomics data, supported by 16S-rRNA-FISH-Flow, imaging flow cytometry and species-specific qPCR, reveal the presence of translocated bacterial genetic sequences in the patients with CRC and IBD, likely due to an intestinal barrier defect. Pathway and serum metabolomics analysis connected to the metabolic potential of the PBMC-derived microbiome sequences support the onset of microbial translocation in such patients. Thus, our data suggest that in patients with intestinal barrier leakage, such as those with CRC or IBD, there is the potential for the translocation of bacterial remnants into the circulation via peripheral immune cells.">

 ACOD1 is the ubiquitous source of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate. We hypothesised monocyte ACOD1 expression is an inhibitory pathway that limits intestinal inflammation.



 We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of colonoscopic biopsies from >120 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and healthy controls, with complementary analysis of DSS treated C57BL/6J (WT) mice, validated using flow cytometry in independent cohorts. Acod1–/– mice received 2% DSS in acute and recovery models, complemented by competitive bone marrow chimeric mice, anti-IFN / itaconate-derivate treatment and transgenic cell depletion models.



 We profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of intestinal CXCL9/10+ cells that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs).
 These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate specific expression of IBD susceptibility genes, including NOD2. By performing cross-species analysis in mice, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete MDP-precursor in the bone marrow and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans.
 Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production.



 Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health. Reduced itaconate production from IAMs in CD may predispose to chronic inflammation and disease progression.

        <tr id="Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare T-cell malignancy characterized by inflamed and painful rash-like skin lesions that may affect large portions of the body’s surface. Patients experience recurrent infections due to a compromised skin barrier and generalized immunodeficiency resulting from a dominant Th2 immune phenotype of CTCL cells. Given the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in normal and malignant T-cell development, we investigated the impact of UPR-inducing drugs on the viability, transcriptional networks, and Th2 phenotype of CTCL. We found that CTCL cells were >5-fold more sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Btz) and exhibited a distinct signaling and transcriptional response compared to normal CD4+ cells. The CTCL response was dominated by the induction of the HSP70 family member HSPA6 (HSP70B’) and, to a lesser extent, HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78). To understand the significance of these two factors, we used a novel isoform selective small-molecule inhibitor of HSPA5/6 (JG-023). JG-023 induced pro-apoptotic UPR signaling and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors and other UPR-inducing drugs in CTCL but not normal T cells. Interestingly, JG-023 also selectively suppressed the production of Th2 cytokines in CTCL and normal CD4+ T cells. Conditioned media (CM) from CTCL were immunosuppressive to normal T cells through an IL-10-dependent mechanism. This immunosuppression could be reversed by JG-023, other HSP70 inhibitors, Btz, and combinations of these UPR-targeted drugs.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disease characterized by the dysregulation of multiple factors, including host immunity. The intestinal activation of T cells showing cytotoxic activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production is one of the key factors in its pathology. Therefore, targeting pro-inflammatory leukocytes from the circulation and in the inflammatory site is a reasonable therapeutic goal. CCR9 is the main activator of gut-tropism in the lymphocytes and responsible for the activation of migratory responses in lymphocytes into the lamina propria.
 SBR1 is a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR9 mAb showing high-affinity and specific binding towards CCR9+ cells. Displaying effector functions such as Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP), SRB1 shows specific depletion of infiltrating and circulating CCR9+ cells in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patient samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.



 Matching blood and 5 mm gut explants were obtained from IBD patients, then they were cultured for 16h with SRB1 and subsequently, CCR9+ cells were characterized by flow cytometry. The culture supernatants from these explants as well as blood samples from the same patients were analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokine production by Multiplex cytokine immune assay. Finally, in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) CCR9 cell depletion was determined by flow cytometric assays at doses of 8, 15 y 25 mg/kg.



 We showed that CCR9 is highly expressed in intestine samples from IBD patients, especially in T cells, but also in other cell types including dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Treatment with SRB1 was able to effectively deplete CCR9+ cells, specifically T CD4+ CCR9+ and CCR9+ memory T cells from blood and intestinal samples from IBD patients. This depletion also reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the culture media. Finally, SRB1 also showed efficacy depleting CCR9 in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) at different doses without showing any secondary adverse effects. All these data suggest a potential therapeutic potential of the antibody in the pathogenesis of IBD patients.



 SRB1 delivers potent blood and tissue depletion of CCR9 expressing cells ex vivo and in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patients’ samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SRB1 (anti-CCR9 mAb) a novel therapeutic approach for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases including CD and UC.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a primary central nervous system malignancy with a median survival of 15–20 months. The presence of both intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity limits understanding of biological mechanisms leading to tumor resistance, including immune escape. An attractive field of research to examine treatment resistance are immune signatures composed of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers and cytokines. CD markers are surface markers expressed on various cells throughout the body, often associated with immune cells. Cytokines are the effector molecules of the immune system. Together, CD markers and cytokines can serve as useful biomarkers to reflect immune status in patients with GBM. However, there are gaps in the understanding of the intricate interactions between GBM and the peripheral immune system and how these interactions change with standard and immune-modulating treatments. The key to understanding the true nature of these interactions is through multi-omic analysis of tumor progression and treatment response. This review aims to identify potential non-invasive blood-based biomarkers that can contribute to an immune signature through multi-omic approaches, leading to a better understanding of immune involvement in GBM.">

        <tr id="Primary and secondary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reduces its efficacy. The mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance are highly complex. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these mechanisms are primarily associated with the loss of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic mutations, circular RNA axis and transcription factor regulation, antigen presentation disorders, and dysregulation of signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a pivotal role in driving immunotherapy resistance. Primary resistance is mainly attributed to TME alterations, including mutations and co-mutations, modulation of T cell infiltration, enrichment of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pulmonary fibrosis. Acquired resistance mainly stems from changes in cellular infiltration patterns leading to “cold” or “hot” tumors, altered interferon (IFN) signaling pathway expression, involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and oxidative stress responses, as well as post-treatment gene mutations and circadian rhythm disruption (CRD). This review presents an overview of various mechanisms underlying resistance to ICB, elucidates the alterations in the TME during primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance, and discusses existing strategies for overcoming ICB resistance.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer cells, an important component of the innate immune system, can directly recognize and lyse virally infected or transformed cells. However, NK cells fail to restrain the growth of malignancies, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The molecular genetics of NK cells in the B-ALL bone marrow microenvironment and the mechanisms underlying the inhibited function of NK cells at the single-cell level remain largely elusive. Methods In this study, we studied the frequency and absolute number of NK cells in peripheral blood samples collected from 43 healthy volunteers and 104 pediatric B-ALL patients diagnosed at Hunan Children’s Hospital. We also analyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from B-ALL and normal bone marrow samples using unsupervised clustering. Our findings were further validated using bulk transcriptomic data and clinical data from a cohort of 139 B-ALL bone marrow samples. Results We found that the frequency and number of NK cells were significantly decreased in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of B-ALL patients. In-depth analysis of scRNAseq data identified 12 NK cell clusters. Among them, the C2 cluster, which is present in healthy bone marrow but reduced in B-ALL bone marrow, displays overexpression of a transcription factor KLF2 and a significant downregulation of the “leukocyte proliferation” pathway. Furthermore, we found that the expression of KLF2 in B-ALL at diagnosis was positively correlated with the percentage of leukemia cells and the positive rate of minimal residual disease (MRD), indicating that KLF2 is a marker of poor prognosis. Conclusion There are dramatic differences at the single-cell level in the transcriptomics of NK cells between healthy donors and B-ALL patients. A transcription factor, KLF2, which is enriched in the C2 cluster of NK cells, has been suggested to regulate the proliferation of NK cells and is associated with poor prognosis of pediatric B-ALL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The occurrence of inflammation subsequent to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with an elevated risk of transplant‐related mortality (TRM). However, the duration of inflammation and the potential efficacy of anti‐inflammatory agents in reducing TRM remain uncertain. We performed a comprehensive investigation to examine the post‐transplantation alterations of inflammatory mediators and to ascertain the correlation between inflammation level and TRM through the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, ELISAs and cytometric bead array. The findings revealed that the 30‐day interval following transplantation is characterised by the most pronounced inflammatory response in both human and murine subjects, thereby elevating the risk of TRM. The inflammation is primarily caused by myeloid bias during haematopoietic reconstitution, which is a commonly overlooked aspect in clinical transplantation, additionally, a lesser extent of irradiation‐induced injury. The administration of the anti‐inflammatory agent resveratrol has the potential to reduce systemic inflammation and TRM by suppressing the NOD‐like receptor signalling pathway and slowing down granulocyte implantation in HSCT mice. This approach did not impair the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells. These findings demonstrate that the 30‐day post‐transplant period represents an opportunity to facilitate HSCT colonisation, mitigate transplant‐related adverse effects, and potentially reap the benefits of anti‐inflammatory treatments.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis, but their dynamics are altered in a subset of people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) known as immunological non-responders (INRs). INRs fail to reconstitute CD4+ T-cell counts despite viral suppression. This study aimed to examine Treg dysregulation in INRs, comparing them to immunological responders (IRs) and healthy controls (HCs).


METHODS
The study included 40 INRs, 42 IRs, and 23 HCs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. Conventional CD4+ T-cells (Tconvs) were identified as CD25-/loFOXP3- cells, while Tregs were identified as CD25+CD127loFOXP3+ CD4+ T-cells. Cells were further divided into naive, central memory, effector memory, and effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) subsets. Activated/cycling cells were identified as CD71+ and quiescent cells were CD71-. Mitochondrial mass and transmembrane potential were measured using MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker Orange dyes, respectively. Statistical comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc analysis and Mann-Whitney U-test.


RESULTS
INRs exhibited the highest frequencies of activated/cycling CD4+ T-cells. The proportion of activated/cycling cells was higher in Tregs compared to Tconvs in all groups. Cycling rates of Tregs and Tconvs were correlated, suggesting Tregs help control Tconv proliferation. Despite high overall Treg frequencies in INRs, they showed a Treg deficiency in activated/cycling CD4+ T-cells, specifically in naive and central memory subsets, causing an imbalance in the Tconv/Treg ratio. This deficiency was hidden by increased Treg frequencies in quiescent effector memory CD4+ T-cells. Activated/cycling naive and memory Tregs from INRs had normal forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and CD25 expression, but activated/cycling memory Tregs showed decreased ability to regulate mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating impaired mitochondrial fitness. These mitochondrial abnormalities were similar to those observed in memory conventional T-cells.


CONCLUSIONS
The complex Treg dysregulation in immunological non-responders involves quantitative and functional alterations, including a Treg deficiency within activated/cycling naive and central memory CD4+ T-cells, impaired mitochondrial fitness of activated/cycling memory Tregs, and functional disorders of the parent conventional T-lymphocytes. These findings underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of Treg dynamics in suboptimal CD4+ T-cell reconstitution during HIV-infection.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are innate immune cells that drive the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and proteases that damage host tissues. Neutrophil activation is regulated, in part, by dynamic changes in gene expression. In this study we have used RNAseq to measure the transcriptomes of neutrophils from people with severe, methotrexate-refractory RA and healthy controls. We identified a dynamic gene expression profile in people with severe RA. This is dominated by a type-I interferon-induced gene expression signature as well as activation of genes regulating neutrophil degranulation, NET production, response to ROS and oxidative stress. Whilst we did not detect significantly elevated levels of interferon-alpha in RA blood sera, we identified increased expression in RA neutrophils of miR-96-5p and miR-183-5p which regulate activation of the interferon pathway as members of the miR-183C cluster. We also detected significantly elevated NET debris in RA blood sera (p<0.05). Using gene set variation analysis we explored the heterogeneity of neutrophil gene expression in RA and identified subsets of patients with gene expression profiles reflecting enhanced neutrophil degranulation and cytotoxicity, tissue inflammation or activation by interferons. Comparison with published single-cell RNAseq datasets identified RA transcriptomes where neutrophils were polarised by genes relating to early or late cell maturity, with significant genes in each polarised state being regulated by miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-183-5p or miR-96-5p. Overall our study demonstrates the heterogeneity of the RA neutrophil transcriptome and proposes miRNA-driven mechanisms for regulating the activated neutrophil phenotype in RA.">

        <tr id="Background Although MDSCs are widely recognized for their immunoinhibitory effects in pathological conditions, their function during HIV infection particularly within the mechanisms underlying incomplete immune recovery remains elusive. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 30 healthy controls and 62 HIV-1-infected subjects [31 immunological non-responders (INRs) and 31 immunological responders (IRs)] were selected. The proportion of MDSCs was determined in each category of participants. Using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, immune regulatory molecules (including PD-L1, ARG1, iNOS, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO) that are relevant for MDSCs activity were quantified. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the blockade of PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways on MDSCs and their effects on CD4+ T-cells using in vitro functional experiments. Results PMN-MDSCs are more abundant and are negatively correlated to CD4 counts in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, PMN-MDSCs suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in INRs. Furthermore, correlations were found between PD-L1 expression on PMN-MDSCs and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells. TGF-β expression on PMN-MDSCs was likewise enhanced in INRs. Importantly, inhibiting both PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways had a synergistic impact on restoring CD4+ T-cell activity in vitro. Conclusions PMN-MDSCs expansion inhibits CD4+ T-cell responses. We suggest that targeting PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways together may significantly improve immune recovery in INRs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Ovarian cancer (OC) remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to its late-stage diagnosis and high recurrence rates. Chronic inflammation is a critical driver of OC progression, contributing to immune evasion, tumor growth, and metastasis. Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, as well as key signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), are upregulated in OC, promoting a tumor-promoting environment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by immune cells like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion. Furthermore, OC cells utilize immune checkpoint pathways, including PD-1/PD-L1, to inhibit cytotoxic T cell activity. Targeting these inflammatory and immune evasion mechanisms offers promising therapeutic strategies. COX-2 inhibitors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway blockers, and NF-kB inhibitors have shown potential in preclinical studies, while immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have been explored with mixed results in OC. Additionally, emerging research on the microbiome and inflammation-related biomarkers, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and exosomes, points to new opportunities for early detection and precision medicine. Future approaches to OC treatment must focus on personalized strategies that target the inflammatory TME, integrating anti-inflammatory therapies with immunotherapy to enhance patient outcomes. Continued research into the interplay between inflammation and immune evasion in OC is essential for developing effective, long-lasting treatments.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy involves significant immunological changes to support fetal development while protecting the mother from infections. A growing body of evidence supports the importance of immune checkpoint pathways, especially at the maternal–fetal interface, although limited information is available about the peripheral expression of these molecules by CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets during the trimesters of pregnancy. Understanding the dynamics of these immune cells and their checkpoint pathways is crucial for elucidating their roles in pregnancy maintenance and potential complications. This study aims to investigate the peripheral expression and functional characteristics of CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets throughout pregnancy, providing insights into their contributions to maternal and fetal health. A total of 34 healthy women were enrolled from the first, 30 from the second and 40 from the third trimester of pregnancy. At the same time, 35 healthy age-matched non-pregnant women formed the control group. From peripheral blood, mononuclear cells were separated and stored at −80 °C. CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets were analyzed from freshly thawed samples, and surface and intracellular staining was performed using flow cytometric analyses. The proportions of CD56+ NK cells in peripheral blood were similar across groups. While CD8− NKdim cells increased significantly in all trimesters compared to non-pregnant controls, CD8+ NKdim cells showed no significant changes. CD8− NKbright cells had higher frequencies throughout pregnancy, whereas CD8+ NKbright cells significantly increased only in the first and second trimesters. The expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and PD-L1, and cytotoxic-activity-related molecules were stable, with notable perforin and granzyme B increases in CD8− NKbright cells throughout pregnancy. Our study shows that peripheral NK cell populations, especially CD8− subsets, are predominant during pregnancy. This shift suggests a crucial role for CD8− NK cells in balancing maternal immune tolerance and surveillance. The stable expression of immune checkpoint molecules indicates that other regulatory mechanisms may be at work. These findings enhance our understanding of peripheral immune dynamics in pregnancy and suggest that targeting CD8− NKbright cell functions could help manage pregnancy-related immune complications. This research elucidates the stable distribution and functional characteristics of peripheral NK cells during pregnancy, with CD8− subsets being more prevalent. The increased activity of CD8− NKbright cells suggests their critical role in maintaining immune surveillance. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to uncover the mechanisms regulating NK cell function in pregnancy, potentially leading to new treatments for immune-related pregnancy complications.">

        <tr id="The increasing use of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade has led to the emergence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including dysfunction of the submandibular gland (SMG). In this study, we investigated the immunoregulatory mechanism contributing to the susceptibility of the SMG to irAEs. We found that the SMGs of PD-1-deficient mice and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-treated mice harbor an expanded population of CD8+ T cells. We demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells expressing PD-L1 tightly regulate CD8+ T cells in the SMG. When this immunoregulation is disrupted, CD8+ T cells clonally expand and acquire a unique transcriptional profile consistent with T cell receptor (TCR) activation. These clonally expanded cells phenotypically overlapped with cytotoxic GzmK+ CD8+ T autoimmune cells identified in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Understanding how NK cells modulate CD8+ T cell activity in the SMG opens new avenues for preventing irAEs in patients undergoing checkpoint blockade therapies.">

        <tr id="During tumor immunosurveillance, leukocytes play a crucial role in the cellular defense system, working collaboratively with other immune components to recognize and eliminate aberrant cells. Integral to this process is the integrin Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen 1 (LFA-1). LFA-1 facilitates adhesion during leukocyte migration and helps establish stable cell-to-cell contacts between leukocytes and their targets. Additionally, as a receptor, LFA-1 signaling activates leukocytes, promoting their differentiation and effector functions against cancer. However, tumors can develop mechanisms to evade immune clearance by disrupting LFA-1 functions or hijacking its pathways. In this review, we first detail how leukocytes utilize LFA-1 during immunosurveillance and then explore how tumors counteract this process in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by either altering LFA-1 functions or exploiting it to drive tumorigenesis. Moreover, we discuss therapeutic strategies targeting LFA-1, including inhibitors tested in laboratory studies and animal models, highlighting their potential as anticancer interventions and the need for further research to evaluate their clinical utility.">

        <tr id="Background The role of memory B cells and their subgroups in allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergen immunotherapy (AIT) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of memory B cells in the circulation of patients with AR and those undergoing AIT, as well as their clinical significance. Methods This study involved a cohort comprising 32 healthy control subjects, 39 individuals diagnosed with AR, and 31 AR patients who had received AIT for over one year. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were used for symptom assessment, and the serum concentrations of immunoglobulins and cytokines were quantified. This study evaluated alterations in the proportions of peripheral blood memory B cells and their subpopulations, plasma cells, and various T-cell subsets across the three participant groups. Results The proportion of IgA+CD27- class-switched memory B cells in the AR group significantly decreased compared to the control group, but significantly increased following AIT (P < 0.05). In AR patients, circulating IgA+CD27- class-switched memory B cells were significantly positively correlated with Treg cells, IL-10, and IL-4 and significantly negatively correlated with IFN-γ, total IgE, sIgE, and VAS scores (P < 0.05). After AIT, the number of circulating IgA+CD27- class-switched memory B cells in AR patients was significantly positively correlated with the number of Treg cells and IL-10 and significantly negatively correlated with the VAS score (P < 0.05). Conclusion The IgA+CD27- class-switched memory cell subset in human peripheral blood may serve as a potential biomarker for evaluating AR symptoms and treatment efficacy. Its mechanism may be associated with interactions between T and B cells.">

To investigate the pro-phagocytic phenotype of macrophages in SSc and other rheumatic diseases by examining their activation, signaling pathways, and treatment responses, with the goal of uncovering mechanisms that drive enhanced phagocytosis.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (GSE138669/GSE212109) from skin and lung macrophages of healthy controls and SSc patients were analyzed. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) were differentiated from CD14+ monocytes from healthy controls, SSc, RA, PsA, and axSpA patients. In selected experiments, hMDMs were pretreated with 0.1 μM nintedanib. Phagocytic activity was quantified using pHrodo bioparticles and flow cytometry. Macrophage surface markers were evaluated by flow cytometry, NF-κB signaling by Western blot, and gene expression by RT-qPCR.


RESULTS
Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets revealed a pro-phagocytic signature in SSc-affected organs. SSc macrophages, particularly the FCGR3A  hi cluster in skin, exhibited elevated expression of FCGR genes and enriched FcγR-mediated phagocytosis pathways, accompanied by pro-inflammatory markers. This phenotype extended to FCN1  hi lung macrophages in SSc patients with interstitial lung disease, indicating a systemic pro-inflammatory and phagocytic profile. hMDMs from SSc, RA, and PsA patients demonstrated enhanced phagocytic activity in vitro. Elevated FcγRI and FcγRII levels were identified as key drivers of increased phagocytic activity and subsequent IL-6-driven inflammation. Nintedanib showed reduction in FcγRI expression, suggesting its potential therapeutic benefit in attenuating the phagocytic process.


CONCLUSION
This study highlights FcγR-expressing macrophages as drivers of phagocytosis and inflammatory responses in SSc. Dysregulated activation of these macrophages could lead to persistent inflammation and fibrosis in rheumatic diseases, highlighting new potential therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="A key feature of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells for eliminating pathogens and malignant cells is their capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, which includes TNF and IFNγ. Provided that these cytokines are highly toxic, a tight control of their production is imperative. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential for the fine-tuning of cytokine production. The role of the RBP ZFP36L1 and its sister protein ZFP36L2 herein has been established, however, their relative contribution to cytokine production is not well known. We here compared the effect of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 single and double deficiency in murine effector CD8+ T cells. Whereas single deficient T cells significantly increased cytokine production, double deficiency completely unleashed the cytokine production. Not only the TNF production was substantially prolonged in double-deficient T cells. Also, the production of IFNγ reached unprecedented levels with >90% IFNγ–producing T cells compared to 3% in WT T cells, even after 3 days of continuous activation. This continuous cytokine production by double-deficient T cells was also observed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo, however, with no effect on tumor growth. Rather, ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 double deficiency resulted in decreased cell viability, impaired STAT5 signaling, and dysregulated cell cycle progression. In conclusion, while combined deletion in ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 can drive continuous cytokine production even under chronic activation, safeguards are in place to counteract such super-cytokine producers.">

        <tr id="Cancer remains a major challenge to global public health, with rising incidence and high mortality rates. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex system of immune cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix (ECM), and blood vessels that form a space conducive to cancer cell proliferation. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are abundant in tumors, and they drive immunosuppression through metabolic reprogramming in the TME. This review describes how metabolic pathways such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and adenosine metabolism have a significant impact on the function of MDSCs by regulating their immunosuppressive activity and promoting their survival and expansion in tumors. The review also explores key metabolic targets in MDSCs and strategies to modulate MDSC metabolism to improve the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding these pathways can provide insight into potential therapeutic targets for modulating MDSC activity and improving outcomes of cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Brain metastasis (BM) is a poor prognostic factor in cancer patients. Despite showing efficacy in many extracranial tumors, immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-CTLA-4 mAb appears to be less effective against intracranial tumors. Promisingly, recent clinical studies have reported that combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs has a potent antitumor effect on BM, highlighting the need to elucidate the detailed mechanisms controlling the intracranial tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we analyzed the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in murine models of BM that responded to anti-CTLA-4 mAb to anti-PD-1 mAb. Activated CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells with high CTLA-4 expression characteristically infiltrated the intracranial TME, which were activated by the combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatment. Loss of TFH cells suppressed the additive effect of CTLA-4 blockade on anti-PD-1 mAb. B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) produced by abundant myeloid cells, particularly CD80hiCD206lo pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages, in the intracranial TME, induced B cell and TFH cell infiltration and activation. Furthermore, the intracranial TME of patients with non-small cell lung cancer featured TFH and B cell infiltration as tertiary lymphoid structures. Together, these findings provide insights into the immune cell crosstalk in the intracranial TME that facilitates an additive anti-tumor effect of CTLA-4 blockade with anti-PD-1 treatment, supporting the potential of a combination immunotherapeutic strategy for BM.">

        <tr id="Although significant progress has been made in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, its overall efficacy remains limited in a large number of patients. The interaction between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and CD8+ T cells is one of the core topics in cancer immunotherapy research. CD8+ T cells can play an anti-tumor role by recognizing and killing virus-infected or mutated cells. However, in the TME, as the tumor compresses immune cells, the function of them is impaired, and studies have found that relying on PD-1 alone is not enough to resist tumor cells. Therefore, by blocking the PD-1 and Tim-3 pathways to interfere with CD8+ T cell exhaustion (TEX), the performance of CD8+ T cells can be maximized, their survival period extended, and the efficacy of positive cancer immunotherapy improved. For patients with cancer who have failed to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy, multi-targeted combination therapy may achieve better results.">

        <tr id="Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

Here, we generated TAK-500, an immune cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC), to deliver a STING agonist to CCR2+ human cells and drive enhanced antitumor activity relative to non-targeted STING agonists. Preclinically, TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent innate immune activation in vitro. In addition, a murine TAK-500 iADC surrogate enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses both in vitro and in murine tumor models. Spatially resolved analysis of CCR2 and immune cell markers in the TME of >1,000 primary human tumors showed the CCR2 protein was predominantly expressed in intratumoral myeloid cells.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Arginase-1 (Arg1) expressing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is a significant challenge for cancer immunotherapy. We previously reported the existence of Arg1-specific memory T cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and described that Arg-1-based immune modulatory vaccines (IMVs) control tumor growth and alter the M1/M2 macrophage ratio in murine models of cancer. In the present study, we investigated how Arg1-specific T cells can directly target TAMs and influence their polarization. Methods Murine Arg1-specific CD4+T cells isolated from splenocytes of animals vaccinated with an Arg1-derived peptide in the adjuvant montanide were co-cultured with either in vitro M2-differentiated bone marrow-derived macrophages or ex vivo isolated F4/80+TAMs. Human Arg1-specific CD4+T cell clones were co-cultured with Arg1-expressing TAMs generated in vitro from either PBMC-derived CD14+cells or the myeloid cell lines MonoMac1 and THP-1. MHC class II-restricted Arg-1 peptide presentation by macrophages was confirmed by immunopeptidomics. T-cell-mediated changes in the macrophage immune phenotype and cytokine microenvironment were examined using flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and multiplex immunoassay. The effect of Arg1-derived peptide IMV on TAMs in vivo was assessed by multiplex gene analysis of F4/80+cells. Results We show that Arg1-based IMV-mediated tumor control was linked to a decrease in multiple immunosuppressive pathways in the TAM population of the treated animals. Tumor-conditioned media (TCM) derived from Arg1-vaccinated mice induced significantly higher upregulation of MHC-II on exposed myeloid cells compared with controls. Furthermore, murine CD4+Arg1-specific T cells were able to target TAMs and effectively reprogram their phenotype ex vivo by secreting IL2 and IFNγ. Next, we established that human Arg1+TAMs present Arg1-derived peptides and are directly recognized by proinflammatory CD4+Arg1-specific T cell clones. These CD4+Arg1-specific T cells were able to reprogram TCM-conditioned macrophages as observed by increased expression of CD80 and HLA-DR. Conclusions TAMs may be directly targeted and modulated by Arg1-specific CD4+T cells. These findings provide a strong rationale for future clinical development of Arg1-based IMVs to alter the immune-suppressive TME by reprogramming TAMs and promoting a proinflammatory TME.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most widely diagnosed cancers worldwide. Despite the advances in medical research, there is still a lot to be explored between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, namely immune cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to mediate communication between cells and can modulate the activity of immune cells. External stimuli such as stress and chemotherapy can influence the activity of the released EVs. Nevertheless, the relationship between chemotherapy, EVs and immune cells has yet to be fully explored. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the immune-related functional mechanisms of EVs isolated from pre- and post- FOLFOX chemotherapy from CRC patients. The EVs were isolated from the serum of matched patients and characterized via dynamic light scattering. The EVs were then co-incubated with primary CD8 T cells isolated from healthy donors and Jurkat cells. The apoptosis, cell cycle profile, gene expression and cytokines were evaluated. Upon treatment with EVs, the T cells underwent apoptosis however no differences were seen in the cell cycle phases. Gene expression related to cytokine release was also differentially expressed namely IRF4. The level of cytokines that were released also differed between the two groups. Our study has shown that there are some minor differences in the activity of the EVs after induction with chemotherapy.">

        <tr id="There is a high medical need to develop new strategies for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) refractory to conventional therapy. In vitro, the combinations of the blast-modulatory response modifiers GM-CSF + Prostaglandin E1, (summarized as Kit M) have been shown to convert myeloid leukemic blasts into antigen-presenting dendritic cells of leukemic origin (DCleu) that were able to (re-)activate the innate and adaptive immune system, direct it specifically against leukemic blasts, and induce memory cells. This study aimed to investigate the immune modulatory capacity and antileukemic efficacy of Kit M in vivo. Brown Norway rats suffering from AML were treated with Kit M (twofold application). Blasts and immune cells were monitored in peripheral blood (PB) and spleen. Upon the observation of promising immune modulatory effects in the treated animals, two patients with AML refractory to multiple lines of therapy were offered treatment with Kit M on an individualized basis. Safety, as well as immunological and clinical effects, were monitored. Samples obtained from a third patient in similar clinical conditions not receiving Kit M were used as controls for immune monitoring tests. Animal experiments: Drugs were well tolerated by the treated animals. After 9 days of treatment, DCleu and memory-like T cells increased in the peripheral blood, whereas regulatory T cells, especially blasts, decreased in treated as compared to untreated control animals. Clinical courses: No severe side effects were observed. In patient 1482, PB blasts remained under the detection threshold during 27 days of treatment, thrombocytes were normalized, and (leukemia specific) immune effector cells of the adaptive and innate immune system increased up to 800-fold compared to the start of treatment. Patient 1601 responded with a 12% reduction in blasts in PB immediately after Kit M treatment. Several subtypes of (leukemia-specific) immune effector cells in PB increased up to four-fold during the 19 days of treatment. In contrast, immune-reactive cells decreased under mild chemotherapy in the PB of control patient 1511 with comparably refractory AML. Within the limitation of low numbers in both animal experiments and clinical applications, our data suggest that Kit M treatment of AML-diseased rats and patients is feasible and may induce leukemia-specific immune reactions and clinical improvement. A larger series and a prospective clinical trial will be required to confirm our observations. Beyond optimized doses and schedules of the applied compounds, the combination with other antileukemic strategies or the application of Kit M in less proliferative stages of the myeloid diseases need to be discussed. If effects are confirmed, the concept may add to the armamentarium of treatments for highly aggressive blood cancer.">

        <tr id="Objective: This study aimed to explore the clinical significance of CD45+CD33+CD14−CD10−HLA-DR−/low neutrophils (Cluster of Differentiation 10 [CD10−] neutrophils) in B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-NHL). An amplification system of CD10− neutrophils in vitro was constructed using cytokines, and the mechanisms underlying the cytokine-induced expansion and activation of the CD10− neutrophil subpopulation were investigated. Material and Methods: We identified a novel suppressive cell population known as CD10− neutrophils in the peripheral blood of patients with B-NHL in different statuses by flow cytometry and found it to be correlated with interleukin-6 levels, T cell counts, and plasma arginase-1 (Arg-1) levels. We then verified the effect of CD10− neutrophil expression on the prognosis of patients with B-NHL. Furthermore, we described a clinically compatible method for generating granulocyte populations rich in CD10− neutrophils using cultures of peripheral blood-isolated neutrophils supplemented with cytokines in vitro. Arg-1 expression was detected in neutrophils before and after induction by cytokines through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry. T-cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester assay and Annexin V-Propidium Iodide stains, and induced cells were exposed to Arg-1 inhibitor and ruxolitinib. signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/Arg-1 signaling was studied mainly by western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Results: We established a correlation between high CD10− neutrophil levels and poorer survival outcomes in patients with B-NHL. Moreover, CD10− neutrophils were positively correlated with interleukin (IL)-6, T-reg cells, and plasma Arg-1 levels and negatively correlated with the absolute number of total T cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and IL-6 could all induce the expansion of CD10− neutrophil phenotype cells in vitro, which exhibit typical immature cellular morphology, and the combination of IL-6 and GM-CSF was the most effective. We confirmed that the STAT3/Arg-1 signaling pathway could be a critical mechanism regulating CD10− neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression in vitro. Conclusion: CD10− neutrophils exhibited basic characteristics similar to conventional myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Our observations provide a promising STAT3 or Arg-1 targeting strategy for B-NHL and an important method for generating remarkably amounts of inhibitory granulocyte populations rich in CD10− neutrophils for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have transformed the landscape of cancer therapy and demonstrate unprecedented success in treating relapsed/refractory blood cancers. The mechanism underlaying the interactions and responses of CAR T cells and their targets remain incompletely understood. Previous studies focus on the activation of CAR T cells and attempt to optimise CAR design to increase efficacy, meanwhile ignoring tumours and their responses to CAR ligation. Here, we evaluate the signalling capacity of a second generation CSF1-tageted CSF1R CAR compared with a scFv-targeted CD19-CAR using a SILAC co- culture approach coupled with phosphotyrosine (pY) enrichment and LC-MS/MS. We show that ligation of CSF1R-expressing THP1 cells with CSF1R-CAR T cells induces CSF1R-like signalling in THP1 cells, whereas no target cell signalling response is observed after CD19- CAR/Raji B cell ligation. Using small molecule inhibitors of Lck, actin polymerisation, and CSF1R, we find that CAR-induced CSF1R signalling in THP1 cells depends exclusively on CSF1R kinase activity with no participation from T cell activation. Consistently, CSF1R- CAR T cells promote THP1 growth at low effector-to-target (E:T) ratios but prevent THP1 growth at high E:T ratios. Our data provide evidence for an unintended consequence of CARs; CAR-induced signalling in cancer cells. These data may have broad implications for the choice of CAR antigen for optimal clinical efficacy. One Sentence Summary: CSF1R-CAR activates intracellular signalling cascades in THP1 cells, which promote THP1 cell growth.">

Previous studies have reported the expansion of CD19+Siglec-10+ B cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. However, the composition of this cell population, phenotype and characteristics are still unknown.


METHODS
We examined this memory B-cell subset's composition and phenotype and determined the SYK and AKT phosphorylation levels by flow cytometry. Additionally, we explored the relationship between Siglec-10 expression on B-cell subsets and clinical manifestations.


RESULTS
Our results indicated elevated levels of Siglec-10 on naive B cells in active SLE patients. Compared with healthy controls (HCs) and inactive SLE patients, the Siglec-10+ B cells in active SLE patients exhibited elevated CD40 and CD21low levels. The levels of Siglec-10 on naive B cells were positively correlated with the proportion of CD21low double negative (DN) B cells and the SLEDAI-2K score.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that the upregulation of Siglec-10+/naive B cells may function as a feedback mechanism to regulate B cell hyperreactivity. Monitoring the proportion of Siglec-10+/naive B cells may contribute to the evaluation of disease progression in SLE.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

We transfected A9 with MR1 to overexpress the molecule and knocked out MR1 in TC1 cells to create MR1-deficient models. These cells were then co-cultured with MAIT cells. MAIT cell proliferation was assessed, and cytokine production, including IFN-, Perforin, and IL-10, was quantified. Our findings showed that MAIT cells that co-cultured with MR1-positive cancer cells exhibited significantly increased proliferation and elevated production of IFN-, Perforin, and IL-10 compared to those co-cultured with MR1-negative cells.

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized immune cells that play a crucial role in presenting antigens and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to combat tumors. The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) can bind to its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This interaction suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Radiation therapy can increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, and detailed studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. As many patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy-either through lack of response or cancer recurrence-there is a critical need to maximize synergistic effects by selecting combination treatments that offer improved therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects. In the present study, immature DCs (iDCs) were introduced directly into irradiated tumor sites (referred as IR/iDCs), and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) were administered intraperitoneally. We confirmed the antitumor effect of combining IR/iDCs and ICBs by examining tumor growth and mouse survival. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes increased in the IR/iDCs-treated groups. Combining IR/iDCs with an anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a significant reduction in distant tumor growth and improved mouse survival rates compared with IR/iDCs alone or IR/iDCs + anti-PD-1 antibody. These findings suggest that integrating radiotherapy, DC-based immunotherapy, and ICB, specifically targeting PD-L1, may be an effective cancer treatment strategy.">

However, their role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an immunosuppressive disease, has not yet been explored. We studied 64 CLL patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the proportion of CD226-expressing cells among different CD8+ T cell subsets (including naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effectors) in CLL patients, stratified by Rai stage and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutation status. Additionally, we compared the effector functions of CD8+CD226+ cells and their CD226- counterparts. We also quantified cytokine and chemokine levels in the plasma of CLL and HCs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed the publicly available bulk RNA-seq on CD226+ and CD226-CD8+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated the impact of elevated cytokines/chemokines on CD226 expression. Our results showed that CD226-expressing cells were significantly decreased within the effector memory and effector CD8+ T cell subsets in CLL patients with advanced Rai stages and unmutated IgHV, a marker of poor prognosis. These cells displayed robust effector functions, including cytokine production, cytolytic activity, degranulation, proliferation, and migration capacity. In contrast, CD8+CD226- T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype with reduced Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) were inversely correlated with the frequency of CD8+CD226+ T cells and may contribute to the downregulation of CD226, possibly leading to T cell dysfunction in CLL. Our findings highlight the critical role of CD8+CD226+RUNX2hi T cells in CLL and suggest that their reduction is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. This study also underscores the potential of targeting IL-6 and MIP-1β to preserve polyfunctional CD8+CD226+ T cells as a promising immunotherapy strategy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies have achieved revolutionary success in cancer therapy. However, the impact of anti-PD-1 therapy on host humoral immunity in humans during cancer immunotherapy requires further investigation. Methods We evaluated immunoglobulin titers by ELISA and screened the immune landscape of immune cells from 25 healthy donors and 50 cases including 25 new-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients prior to systemic treatment and 25 HCC patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy by multicolor flow cytometry. Flow or beads sorted cells were cultured ex vivo for proliferation and functional analysis. Results Anti-PD-1 therapy significantly increased the levels of IgG and IgA in the periphery of HCC patients. Anti-PD-1 treatment led to an increase in plasmablasts and a notable rise in circulating T follicular regulatory (cTfr) cells, while changes in circulating B cells, T follicular helper cells, or regulatory T cells were not significant. Anti-PD-1 therapy also influenced the proliferation and function of cTfr cells, promoting the differentiation of CD38+ cTfr cells. We observed that the CD38+ Tfr cell subset in the peripheral blood can promote plasmablast differentiation, associated with altered antibody production. Conclusions Together, these data demonstrate the immunomodulatory role of PD-1 in restricting the differentiation and function of human cTfr cells and in regulating humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-34 (IL34) and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) signal through a shared receptor (CSF1R) to control macrophage survival, differentiation and function. Here we describe the impact of loss of function mutation in the rat Il34 gene. Il34-/- rats showed a partial reduction in macrophages within squamous epithelia (Langerhans-like cells) and in the testis. In the brain, microglia and brain-associated macrophages were selectively depleted in grey matter. A gradient of microglial density in Il34-/- cortex suggests that CSF1 can diffuse outwards from the corpus callosum. The reduced density of microglia was not associated with detectable neuropathology or behavioural alterations. In RNA-seq analysis of cortex, hippocampus and thalamus the only change is selective and uniform loss of the microglial signature. In the periphery, increased Il34 expression has been associated with epithelial injury. In the adenine diet model of renal interstitial fibrosis both Il34 and Csf1 were induced. The absence of IL34 led to a significant reduction in macrophage recruitment compared to controls, but pathology assessed histologically or by detection of damage-associated mRNA signature was unaffected. We suggest that IL34 and CSF1 provide redundant signals to sustain microglia and to direct macrophage recruitment and repair tissue injury in the periphery.">

We discuss the contribution of T cells to myocardial injury and remodeling, with emphasis on specific immune receptors, e.g., CD69, that have a critical role in regulating immune tolerance and maintaining the balance between T cell subsets in the heart. Additionally, we offer a perspective on recent advances in T cell–targeted therapies and their potential to modulate immune responses and improve clinical outcomes in patients with CVD and in heart transplant recipients.

        <tr id="Cervical tumors are usually treated using surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and would benefit from immunotherapies. However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, specifically focusing on TLS, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor concentration dosage in the TME and spatial interaction analyses. We found that TLS presence was associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation was associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and proximity of activated conventional type 2 DCs (DC2) to CD8+ T cells, indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associated TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density with improved progression-free survival, substantiating TLS presence as a potential prognostic marker. Our results provide evidence that TLS presence denotes cell activation and immunotherapy target expression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Several cancer treatments that have been used for quite a few decades include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. These resulted in significant responses and the prolongation of survival for a subset of cancer patients. Another subset was not responsive to such treatments and many of the originally responding patients became unresponsive to subsequent treatments and succumbed to the disease. Fortunately, a new treatment was introduced that takes advantage of the patient’s immune response to fight the cancer and eradicate it, as it does with viral and microbial infections too. The immune response to cancer is called “immunotherapy”. Several immunotherapeutic approaches were developed and approved by the FDA for various cancers, and yield significant clinical responses and the prolongation of survival in many cancer patients. Immunotherapy depends largely on the patient’s immune response being activated and killing the tumor cells. Killing the tumor cells is mediated by immune cells, called CD8 T cells, which need to locate and bind to the cancer cells to kill them. Interestingly, cancer cells strive to survive and escape their death via the CD8 T cells. They manifest this clever approach by inducing various markers on their surface that will prevent them from killing the cancer cells, resulting in the survival and growth of the cancer cells. Therefore, such a failure of immunotherapy required a remedy. Indeed, a remedy was found through which these markers were inhibited therapeutically by agents approved by the FDA, resulting in the cancer cells’ ability to inhibit the CD8 T cells being overridden. Such approved agents were very effective in many cancer patients, but unfortunately not all. Here too we needed to develop other therapies to treat the unresponsive patients. Here, we describe a novel approach that involves using an agent that inhibits the expression of the above inhibitory markers on the CD8 T cells, allowing them to be active and kill the cancer cells in unresponsive patients. It is worthwhile to develop this new approach through research investigation and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Prolonged immunosuppressive therapy in liver transplantation (LT) is associated with significant adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity, metabolic complications, and heightened risk of infection or malignancy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a promising target for inducing immune tolerance in LT, with the potential to reduce or eliminate the need for life-long immunosuppression. This review summarizes current knowledge on the roles of Tregs in LT, highlighting their mechanisms and the impact of various immunosuppressive agents on Treg stability and function. The liver’s distinct immunological microenvironment, characterized by tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells and high levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-β, positions this organ as an ideal setting for Treg-mediated tolerance. We discuss Treg dynamics in LT, their association with rejection risk, and their utility as biomarkers of transplant outcomes. Emerging strategies, including the use of low-dose calcineurin inhibitors with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, adoptive Treg therapy, and low-dose IL-2, aim to enhance Treg function while providing sufficient immunosuppression. Thus, the future of LT involves precision medicine approaches that integrate Treg monitoring with tailored immunosuppressive protocols to optimize long-term outcomes for LT recipients.">

        <tr id="Specialized memory CD4 T cells that reside long-term within tissues are critical components of immunity at portals of pathogen entry. In the lung, such tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells are activated rapidly after infection and promote local inflammation to control pathogen levels before circulating T cells can respond. However, optimal clearance of Influenza A virus can require TRM and responses by other virus-specific T cells that reach the lung only several days after their activation in secondary lymphoid organs. Whether local CD4 TRM sentinel activity can impact the efficiency of T cell activation in secondary lymphoid organs is not clear. Here, we found that recognition of antigen by influenza -primed TRM in the airways promotes more rapid migration of highly activated antigen-bearing dendritic cells to the draining lymph nodes. This in turn accelerated the priming of naive T cells recognizing the same antigen, resulting in newly activated effector T cells reaching the lungs earlier than in mice not harboring TRM. Our findings thus reveal a circuit linking local and regional immunity whereby antigen recognition by TRM improves effector T cell recruitment to the site of infection though enhancing the efficiency of antigen presentation in the draining lymph node.">

In this study, we investigated the effects of 2D and 3D culturing conditions on human primary CAFs integrated into a modular tumor microenvironment (TME). Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and Proteomics’ Proximity Extension Assays, we characterized CAF transcriptomic profiles and cytokine levels. Remarkably, when cultured in 2D, CAFs exhibited a myofibroblast (myCAF) subtype, whereas in 3D tumor spheroid cultures, CAFs displayed a more inflammatory (iCAF) pathological state. By integrating single-cell gene expression data with functional interrogations of critical TME-related processes [natural killer (NK)-mediated tumor killing, monocyte migration, and macrophage differentiation], we were able to reconcile form with function. In 3D TME spheroid models, CAFs enhance cancer cell growth and immunologically shield cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, in striking contrast with their 2D TME counterparts. Notably, 3D CAF-secreted proteins manifest a more immunosuppressive profile by enhancing monocyte transendothelial migration and differentiation into M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our findings reveal a more immunosuppressive and clinically relevant desmoplastic TME model that can be employed in industrial drug discovery campaigns to expand the cellular target range of chemotherapeutics.">

        <tr id="Maternal gut microbiota composition contributes to the status of the neonatal immune system and could influence the early life higher susceptibility to viral respiratory infections. Using a novel protocol of murine maternal probiotic supplementation, we report that perinatal exposure to Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (L.rh) or Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B.lac) increases the influenza A/PR8 virus (IAV) clearance in neonates. Following either supplementation, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) were amplified in the lymph nodes leading to an enhanced IAV antigen-experienced IFN-γ producing effector CD8 T cells in neonates and IAV-specific resident memory CD8 T cells in adulthood. This was compatible with a higher protection of the offspring upon a secondary infection. Interestingly, only mice born to L.rh supplemented mothers further displayed an increased activation of IFN-γ producing virtual memory CD8 T cells and a production of IL-10 by CD4 and CD8 T cells that could explain a better control of the lung damages upon infection. In the offspring and the mothers, no disturbance of the gut microbiota was observed but, as analyzed through an untargeted metabolomic approach, both exposures modified neonatal plasma metabolites. Among them, we further demonstrated that genistein and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid recapitulate viral clearance or cDC1 activation in neonates exposed to IAV. We conclude that maternal L.rh or B.lac supplementation confers the neonates specific metabolomic modulations with a better CD8 T cell-mediated immune protection against IAV infection.">

Cirrhosis, an advanced stage of liver diseases, induces Cirrhosis-Associated Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CAIDS) characterized by both innate and adaptive immune dysfunction. Inflammation triggered by factors such as alcohol, viruses, toxins, and cholesterol induce metabolic reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Our study specifically sought to investigate the compromised adaptive immune response in cirrhosis by focusing on assessing T-cell exhaustion and activation markers on helper and cytotoxic T cells.


METHOD
A prospective observational study involving 19 liver cirrhosis patients and 36 healthy controls was conducted. Hepatic decompensation degree was assessed using various parameters including serum bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. T cell activation (CD38, CD44, CD69, HLADR), and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) were assessed on helper and cytotoxic T cells by flow cytometry.


RESULT
Cirrhosis patients showed reduced T cells with no alteration in CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. Among activation markers, HLADR showed increased expression on CD8+ T cells (P=0.031). Regarding exhaustion markers LAG-3 and TIM-3 exhibited increased expression in cirrhotic patients compared to controls in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (P=0.004, P=0.016, P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively). Neither cirrhotic nor healthy controls showed CTLA expression. PD-1 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Co-expression of PD-1/TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells was notably higher in cirrhotic patients (P<0.002).


CONCLUSION
The observation of impaired adaptive immunity with notable T cell exhaustion and activation in cirrhosis underscores the potential relevance of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background: T cell mediated immunity is reported to play a pathogenic role in cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplant (HTx) patients. However, peripheral blood CD8+ T cells have not been previously characterized in CAV. This study aimed to identify potentially pathogenic circulating CD8+ T cell populations in high grade CAV patients using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq). Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) grade 2 or 3 CAV (high grade CAV; n=6) and normal HTx (n=12) patients were analyzed using CITE-seq and VDJ-seq. Key findings were validated by flow cytometry in an independent patient cohort of age-matched CAV (n=11) patients, normal HTx (n=12) patients and healthy donor subjects (n=11). Results: Among the seven peripheral CD8+ T cell clusters, high grade CAV patients demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of the CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ effector memory T (Tem) cell cluster compared to normal HTx patients (median 6.2% vs 2.9%, p=0.01). CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ Tem cells showed clonal expansion, activated interferon-{gamma} (IFNG) signaling and enhanced cytotoxicity with granzyme B (GZMB) and perforin (PRF) overexpression. Significantly higher proportion of the proinflammatory and cytotoxic CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ Tem cell cluster in high grade CAV compared to normal HTx patients was validated by flow cytometry. There was significantly increased clonal expansion of peripheral CD8+ T cells in high grade CAV compared to normal HTx patients (median Shannon index = 4.4 vs 6.1, p=0.03). CITE-seq identified LAIR2 as a potential biomarker for identifying high grade CAV patients as increased expression was found in CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ Tem cells. Plasma LAIR2 was significantly elevated in the high grade CAV (n=20) compared to normal HTx patients (n=20; 16.0 pg/mL vs 70.3 pg/mL, p=0.02). Conclusions: We discovered and validated circulating CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ Tem cells to be significantly increased in high grade CAV compared to normal HTx patients. The proinflammatory and cytotoxic phenotype of this CD8+ T cell cluster suggest its potential pathogenic role in human CAV.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by its ability to evade the immune system, hindering the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Recent research has highlighted the important role of immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in driving this immune evasion. In this study, we are the first to identify THEMIS2 as a key regulator of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated immunosuppression in GBM. We found that a high THEMIS2 expression is associated with poor patient outcomes and increased infiltration of immune cells, particularly macrophages. Functional analyses revealed THEMIS2’s critical involvement in immune-related pathways, including immune response activation, mononuclear cell differentiation, and the positive regulation of cytokine production. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated that macrophages with a high THEMIS2 expression were associated with increased phagocytosis, immune suppression, and enhanced tumor growth. These findings suggest that THEMIS2 could serve as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in GBM.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is regarded as a dysregulated immune response to infections. Recent study showed partially reversal of immunosuppression by trained immunity, which fosters an enhanced immune response towards a secondary challenge. However, the role of trained immunity in sepsis has not been fully understood. Methods We profiled the characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from septic patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. Murine double-hit models (pretreatment or post-treatment of β-glucan in septic mice) and murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were used then. Results scRNA-seq revealed that Ring finger protein 146 (RNF146) and protein kinase B (Akt) were downregulated in the immunosuppression period of septic patients and were verified to be decreased in bone marrow and spleen monocytes from septic mice. While β-glucan pretreatment improved the immunosuppressed state in septic mice and increased dectin-1/Akt/RNF146 expressions in monocytes, along with the increased survival rate, inflammatory factors and aerobic glycolysis, indicating a change from immunosuppression to immune training. Moreover, RNF146 regulated dectin-1-Akt-mTOR signaling in the trained immune state of murine monocyte/macrophage RAW264.7 cell line and the expression of RNF146 was dependent on dectin-1-Akt activation. The inhibition of dectin-1 by its antagonist laminarin downregulated Akt-RNF146 signaling and partially reversed β-glucan induced trained immunity in septic mice. Conclusion RNF146 and Akt are downregulated in the immunosuppression period of sepsis, while increased after β-glucan pretreatment induced trained immunity in septic mice. Moreover, RNF146 regulates the immune trained state of monocyte through dectin-1-Akt-mTOR pathway, suggesting a possible target in reversal of immunosuppression in sepsis.">

 Secretory IgA (sIgA) is critical for the maintenance of the mucosal barrier function, preventing bacterial translocation and reducing the risk of chronic inflammation. Several decades of research have revealed a dysregulation of the B-cell compartment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of yet unknown origin1,2. While increased serum levels of (auto)antibodies against S. cerevisiae or the intestinal M-cell expressed FimH receptor glycoprotein 2 (GP2) are observed in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD)3, some studies indicated an impaired generation of intestinal immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells (PCs)4. To unravel the role of mucosal humoral immunity in CD pathogenesis, we aimed to provide an in-depth characterisation of colonic PC differentiation in patients with CD.



 In-depth phenotyping of patients with CD in remission and non-IBD controls (hospitalised normals) was performed using multi-omics analyses (spatial single-cell proteomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) of plasma or colon biopsy samples. Colonic switched memory B cells (sMBCs) were sorted from lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNCs) by magnetic-activated cell sorting and ex vivo differentiated into PCs. The impact of mitochondrial function on colonic PC maturation was studied in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V-deficient ATP8 mutant mice and mice that underwent nutritional intervention.



 Despite a hyperactive colonic B-cell compartment, patients with CD displayed significantly diminished mucosal dimeric IgA (dIgA) and fecal IgA compared to non-IBD controls. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) expression did not differ, excluding a defective epithelial transcytosis of dIgA. Spatial single-cell proteomics uncovered that colonic plasmablasts and immature CD19+CD45+ PCs were increased at the expense of the fully mature CD19-CD45- phenotype. Consistently, PCs generated ex vivo from CD-derived sMBCs revealed impaired capacity to differentiate into IgA-secreting PCs. Metabolic phenotyping indicated a colonic mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with CD that was also reflected in colonic PCs by increased expression of the cell-surface NADase CD38 in concert with decreased expression of mitochondrially encoded transcripts. Of note, splenic PCs isolated from ATP8 mutant mice displayed a hyperproliferative and low-differentiated phenotype, while colonic IgA-secreting PCs were reduced. Conversely, feeding mice an isocaloric glucose-free, high-protein diet, which promotes mitochondrial activity, increased colonic IgA levels.



 In summary, this study links mitochondrial dysfunction to impaired PC differentiation in patients with CD, resulting in reduced levels of sIgA and thereby compromised mucosal barrier integrity.

        <tr id="Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a debilitating pulmonary disorder that occurs due to persistent exposure to beryllium (Be) particles in the workplace. Be-exposure causes activation of the innate immune system, resulting in the secretion of interleukins and chemokines that drive the accumulation of B and T cells in the lungs. However, the mechanisms by which innate molecules influence the recruitment of B cells and B cell-mediated protection in CBD are poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiple approaches to examine the role of innate immune signaling and CD4+ T cells in B cell recruitment and function in the lungs. We show that the absence or blocking of IL-1R1 signaling prevents the recruitment of B cells to the lungs of BeO-exposed mice. Additionally, we show that B cell recruitment to the lungs depends on the chemokine receptor, CXCR5, and CD4+ T cells. In BeO-exposed mice, lung B cells down-regulate IgM but showed an increased IgD and CD44 surface expression. Further, RNA sequencing of pulmonary tissue-specific B cells in CBD revealed distinct gene signatures compared to splenic B cells, with increased expression of pathways involved in antigen presentation, tight junction interactions, and interferon signaling. Overall, our study shows that B cell recruitment and aggregate formation during CBD depend on sequential activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.">

        <tr id="Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is related to increased susceptibility to secondary infections and death. Lung is the most vulnerable target organ in sepsis, but the understanding of the pulmonary immunosuppression state is still limited. Here, single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is performed to map the landscape of immune cells, revealing a neutrophil-driven immunosuppressive program in the lungs of patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Although immunosuppressive genes are upregulated in different immune cells, only neutrophils dramatically increase in the BALF of patients in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Five neutrophil subpopulations in BALF are identified, among which CXCR2+ and CD274 (PD-L1 coding gene)+IL1RN+ neutrophil subpopulations increased significantly during septic immunosuppression. Interestingly, a developmental trajectory from CXCR2+ to CD274+IL1RN+ neutrophil subpopulation is disclosed. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CXCR2 blockade is observed on the survival of septic mice, along with a decreased number of PD-L1+ neutrophils. Taken together, the CXCR2+ neutrophil subpopulation is discovered as a contributor to immunosuppression in sepsis and identified it as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis treatment.">

        <tr id="Cytokines play a crucial role in mediating cell communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages are particularly influential in the regulation of immunosuppressive cytokines, thereby supporting tumor metastasis. The upregulation of Th2 cytokines in cancer cells is recognized for its involvement in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, the association between these cytokines and tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the connection between tumor-promoting macrophages and melanoma-derived EVs. The analysis from altered cytokine profile data showed that melanoma-derived EVs upregulate Th2 cytokine expression in naïve macrophages, thereby contributing to the promotion of tumor-supporting functions. Notably, many of these cytokines were also found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma patients (n = 30) compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Overall, our findings suggest a strong connection between melanoma secretory EVs and the induction of tumor-associated macrophages that facilitates the development of an immunosuppressive TME, supporting melanoma metastasis through regulation at both local and systemic levels.">

        <tr id="Organisms constantly face environmental stressors that threaten their cellular and genomic integrity. In their response, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and/or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and trigger the innate immune response. In this study we tested the hypothesis that DAMPs contribute to radiation-induced cellular plasticity in Glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is known to be organized hierarchically with a small number of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) driving treatment resistance and recurrences. Using patient-derived GBM specimens, we employed sphere forming capacity assays and in vitro extreme limiting dilution assays to examine how innate immune receptor signaling impacts the maintenance and self-renewal of GICs. By leveraging an imaging system for putative GICs we determined de novo induction of GICs from non-stem glioma cells. We find that GIC maintenance after irradiation is mediated by cGAS-independent STING signaling, possibly involving signaling through TLR4 and TLR9. Induction of radiation-induced plasticity involves TLR3 signaling, with potential roles for other receptors and processes modulated by MyD88. These findings suggest that targeting innate immune signaling could prevent radiation-induced cellular plasticity for potential therapeutic benefit.">

        <tr id="CCR2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is widely expressed on monocytes, macrophages, activated T cells, and other cell types, and plays a critical role in coordinating the immune response to various infections. Here we demonstrate that CCR2 expression is significantly elevated during Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) respiratory infection, and its absence leads to exacerbated susceptibility, as evidenced by significant weight loss, higher bacterial loads, severe lung pathology, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β, tnfα, and il-6). The absence of ccr2 impairs both myeloid cell infiltration and T cell responses, which are crucial for effective immune defense. Specifically, ccr2 deficiency disrupts the differentiation and response of Th1 cells, which are the primary effector lineage responsible for clearing chlamydia through secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). As a result, there is a significant decrease in CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells in the lung and spleen, accompanied by reduced levels of IFN-γ protein and mRNA, as well as downregulated mRNA expression of Th1-promoting cytokines (il-12p35, il-12p40) and transcription factors (stat4, T-bet), which play crucial roles in Th1 differentiation. Moreover, ccr2 deficiency greatly diminishes STAT1 phosphorylation, a key regulator of IFN-γ secretion by Th1 cells. Meanwhile, we also observed a significant reduction in IFN-γ secretion by CD8+ T cells following ccr2 deficiency. Conversely, ccr2-/- mice exhibit an exaggerated Th2-type immune response, with elevated levels of Th2-promoting cytokines (IL-4), transcription factors (STAT6 and gata3), and il-5, which together lead to more severe lung tissue damage and increased susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, these mice show higher levels of IL-17 along with an enhanced Th17-type immune response, characterized by increased Th17-promoting cytokines TGFB, transcription factors stat3 and RORγt, and il-21, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that drives neutrophil infiltration to exacerbate lung inflammation. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CCR2, a chemokine receptor, in orchestrating the immune response to Chlamydia infection by facilitating Th1 cells differentiation while restraining Th2-type and Th17-type immune responses, thereby alleviating pulmonary inflammation.">

        <tr id="Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity, displaying potent anti-tumor properties through cytokine secretion, direct cytotoxicity, and recruitment of immune effector cells such as CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Despite their therapeutic potential, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), limits iNKT cell efficacy. Patient-derived organoid (PDO) platforms provide an innovative model for dissecting these complex interactions and evaluating strategies to reinvigorate iNKT cell functionality within the TME. PDOs closely mimic the genetic, phenotypic, and structural characteristics of primary tumors, enabling the study of tumor–immune dynamics. Integrating iNKT cells into PDOs offers a robust platform for investigating CD1d-mediated interactions, Th1-biased immune responses driven by glycolipid analogs like α-GalCer, and combination therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, PDO systems can assess the effects of metabolic modulation, including reducing lactic acid accumulation or targeting glutamine pathways, on enhancing iNKT cell activity. Emerging innovations, such as organoid-on-a-chip systems, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and multi-omics approaches, further expand the potential of PDO–iNKT platforms for personalized immunotherapy research. Although the application of iNKT cells in PDOs is still undeveloped, these systems hold immense promise for bridging preclinical studies and clinical translation. By addressing the challenges of the TME and optimizing therapeutic strategies, PDO–iNKT platforms offer a transformative avenue for advancing cancer immunotherapy and personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="Background Subjects with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), such as rheumatoid arthritis, with tuberculosis infection (TBI), have a high probability of progressing to tuberculosis disease (TB). We aim to characterize the impact of IMID on the immune response to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in patients with TBI and TB disease. Methods We enrolled TBI and TB patients with and without IMID. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with Mtb-derived epitopes (MTB300). By flow-cytometry, we identified the Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells as cytokine-producing T cells or as CD25+ CD134+ CD4+ T cells. Memory and activation status of Mtb-specific T cells were assessed by evaluating: CD153, HLA-DR, CD45RA, CD27. Mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) was used to evaluate the ability of PBMCs to inhibit mycobacteria growth. A long-term stimulation assay was used to detect a memory response. Results The IMID status and therapy did not affect the magnitude of response to Mtb-antigen stimulation and the number of responders. TBI-IMID showed a cytokine profile like TBI and TB patients. The Mtb response of TBI-IMID patients was characterized by an effector memory and central memory phenotype as in TBI and TB groups. This memory phenotype allowed the increased IFN-γ production after 6 days of MTB300-stimulation. HLA-DR expression on Mtb-specific T cells was associated with TB, whereas CD153 was associated with TBI status. Finally, the TBI-IMID had an MGIA response like TBI and TB patients. Conclusion IMID condition does not affect key aspects of the immune response to Mtb, such as the cytokine response, memory and activation profile, and the ability to contain the mycobacteria replication. The immunological characterization of the fragile population of TBI-IMID patients is fundamental to understanding the correlation between protection and disease.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are critical regulators of T-cell exhaustion, impairing their ability to eliminate antigens present during chronic viral infections. Current immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in the clinic aim to reinvigorate exhausted T cells; yet, most patients fail to respond or develop resistance to these therapies, underscoring the need to better understand these immunosuppressive pathways. PSGL-1 (Selplg), a recently discovered immune checkpoint, negatively regulates T-cell function. We investigated the cell-intrinsic effects of PSGL-1, PD-1, and combined deletion on CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection. We found that combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 (Selplg-/-Pdcd1-/-) deficiency in CD8+ T cells increased their frequencies and numbers throughout chronic infection compared to the wild type. This phenotype was primarily driven by PD-1 deficiency. Furthermore, while PD-1 deletion increased virus-specific T-cell frequencies, it was detrimental to their function. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improved T-cell function but resulted in lower frequencies and numbers. The primary mechanism behind these differences in cell maintenance was driven by proliferation rather than survival. Combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 deletion resulted in defective T-cell differentiation, driving cells from a progenitor self-renewal state to a more terminal dysfunctional state. These findings suggest that PD-1 and PSGL-1 have distinct, yet complementary, roles in regulating T-cell exhaustion and differentiation during chronic viral infection. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the individual and combined roles of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. It underscores the potential of targeting these checkpoints in a more dynamic and sequential manner to optimize virus-specific T-cell responses, offering critical perspectives for improving therapeutic strategies aimed at reinvigorating exhausted CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEOur findings provide a comprehensive analysis of how the dual deletion of PD-1 and PSGL-1 impacts the response and function of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, revealing novel insights into their roles in chronic infection. Notably, our findings show that while PD-1 deletion enhances T-cell frequencies, it paradoxically reduces T-cell functionality. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improves T-cell function but reduces their survival. Whereas the combined deletion of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T cells improved their survival but decreased their function and progenitor-exhausted phenotypes during infection. We believe our study advances the understanding of immune checkpoint regulation in chronic infections and has significant implications for developing more effective immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by self-antibody production and widespread inflammation affecting various body tissues. This disease is driven by the breakdown of immune tolerance, which promotes the activation of autoreactive B and T cells. A key feature of SLE is dysregulation in antigen presentation, where antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a central role in perpetuating immune responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly specialized for antigen presentation among APCs. At the same time, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can also express MHC-II molecules, although their role in SLE is less understood. Utilizing the SLE model, MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/J, we determined the presence of different phenotypes of DCs and MDSCs expressing MHC-II in secondary lymphoid organs, along with the gene expression of ICOSL, CD80 and CD86 in the spleen. Our study determined that the most abundant population of APCs in secondary lymphoid organs corresponds to cDC CD103−CD11b+ MHC-II+ throughout SLE development. Additionally, ICOSL expression increased over time, becoming more preponderant in week 16 in the SLE model, which could indicate that it is a crucial pathway for the development and progression of the pathology. In week 16, we observed a positive correlation between M-MDSC MHC-II and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Background: Immune dysregulation is a component of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Cannabidiol (CBD) has immunomodulatory and putative antidepressant effects. The relationship between apoptotic and exhaustion immune markers and the clinical features of MDD and the effects of CBD on these markers are still unknown. Objectives: To assess pro-apoptotic (CD95) and T cell exhaustion (TIM3) markers on immune cells in patients with MDD, as well as the impact of in vitro CBD administration on these markers. Methods: We recruited healthy controls and MDD patients and evaluated the immunophenotypes of T/B lymphocytes using flow cytometry in unstimulated and anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated conditions. We evaluated the immune profiles of M1 macrophages, T helper (Th)17 cells, immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), T cell proliferation, and immune-related neurotoxicity (IRN). We investigated the in vitro effects of CBD on immune cell subsets at concentrations of 0.1 ug/mL, 1 ug/mL, and 10.0 ug/mL. Results: The stimulated CD3+CD95+ cell percentages were substantially correlated with the number of depressive episodes, recurrence of illness, and suicidal behaviors. The stimulated CD8+TIM-3+ cell percentages were substantially and inversely associated with the M1, IRS, CIRS, T cell growth, and IRN immune profiles. TIM-3+ bearing CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD20+ cells were significantly suppressed by lower CBD concentrations (0.1 to 1 ug/mL). TIM3+ and all CD95+ bearing cells, with the exception of CD3+CD95+, were suppressed by the higher CBD concentrations. Discussion: Aberrations in immune checkpoint molecular processes impact the features of MDD. CBD significantly impacts apoptotic and exhaustion processes thereby possibly interfering with immune homeostasis.">

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) DLI responders, we identified clonally expanded ZNF683+ CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with in vitro specificity for patient-matched AML. These cells originated primarily from the DLI product and appeared to coordinate antitumor immune responses through interaction with diverse immune cell types within the marrow microenvironment. Nonresponders lacked this cross-talk and had cytotoxic T lymphocytes with elevated TIGIT expression.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the key immunosuppressive components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and contribute to tumor development, progression, and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Several reagents targeting TAMs have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies, but they have had limited success. Here, we show that a unique reagent, FF-10101, exhibited a sustained inhibitory effect against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor by forming a covalent bond and reduced immunosuppressive TAMs in the TME, which led to strong antitumor immunity. In preclinical animal models, FF-10101 treatment significantly reduced immunosuppressive TAMs and increased antitumor TAMs in the TME. In addition, tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were increased; consequently, tumor growth was significantly inhibited. Moreover, combination treatment with an anti–programmed cell death 1 (anti–PD-1) antibody and FF-10101 exhibited a far stronger antitumor effect than either treatment alone. In human cancer specimens, FF-10101 treatment reduced programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on TAMs, as observed in animal models. Thus, FF-10101 acts as an immunomodulatory agent that can reduce immunosuppressive TAMs and augment tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, thereby generating an immunostimulatory TME. We propose that FF-10101 is a potential candidate for successful combination cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.">

 Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine linked to inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where it contributes to inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis. Despite its established role, the specific signals driving OSM expression in colitis remain unclear.



 Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated using M-CSF and stimulated for 36 hours with a range of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and bacterial lysates. OSM secretion was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To dissect key signaling pathways, we applied chemical inhibitors and utilized macrophages derived from gene-deficient mice.



 Myd88-dependent stimuli, including TLR1/2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR4 (LPS), TLR2/6 (FSL-1), TLR7/8 (R848), IL-1α, and IL-33, significantly increased OSM expression in BMDMs. Gram-negative (E. coli, C. rodentium) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacterial lysates also enhanced OSM secretion. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ further boosted OSM levels, consistent with in vivo findings of OSM upregulation in inflammatory monocytes. Additionally, IL-4, which induces a tissue repair phenotype in macrophages, markedly increased OSM secretion.



 OSM expression in BMDMs is driven by multiple signaling pathways, indicating a synergistic effect of diverse stimuli. Identifying key stimulatory and inhibitory molecules, alongside macrophage-specific knockout analyses, will help clarify the upstream regulators of OSM. Understanding these drivers may uncover new therapeutic targets in IBD and offer insights into the onset of fibrotic processes.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Tumour-infiltrating T cells can mediate both antitumour immunity and promote tumour progression by creating an immunosuppressive environment. This dual role is especially relevant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterised by a unique microenvironment and limited success with current immunotherapy.


OBJECTIVE
We evaluated T cell responses in patients with advanced HCC by analysing tumours, liver flushes and liver-draining lymph nodes, to understand whether reactive T cell populations could be identified despite the immunosuppressive environment.


DESIGN
T cells isolated from clinical samples were tested for reactivity against predicted neoantigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to evaluate the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of antigen-experienced T cells. Neoantigen-reactive T cells expressing 4-1BB were isolated and characterised through T-cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing.


RESULTS
Bioinformatic analysis identified 542 candidate neoantigens from seven patients. Of these, 78 neoantigens, along with 11 hotspot targets from HCC driver oncogenes, were selected for ex vivo T cell stimulation. Reactivity was confirmed in co-culture assays for 14 targets, with most reactive T cells derived from liver flushes and lymph nodes. Liver flush-derived T cells exhibited central memory and effector memory CD4+ with cytotoxic effector profiles. In contrast, tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an exhausted profile were primarily identified in the draining lymph nodes.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer valuable insights into the functional profiles of neoantigen-reactive T cells within and surrounding the HCC microenvironment. T cells isolated from liver flushes and tumour-draining lymph nodes may serve as a promising source of reactive T cells and TCRs for further use in immunotherapy for HCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Given the poor outcomes of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA), there is a major unmet need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Impairment of pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) signaling is a known pathomechanism and prognostic factor in IAPA patients. Therefore, we performed immunotherapy with nebulized PRR agonists in a murine IAPA model and studied its impact on infection outcomes and pulmonary immunopathology. Timeline of experimental interventions. Abbreviations: AF = Aspergillus fumigatus, CA = cortisone acetate (10 mg intraperitoneally), IAV = nebulization with influenza A virus (7.5% of the 90% lethal dose), PBS = phosphate-buffered saline (mock therapy), P/O = Pam2/ODN, VPS = viral pneumonia score (0 = healthy – 12 = moribund). Methods 8-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with influenza A virus (IAV, H3N2), immunosuppressed with cortisone acetate (CA) on days (d) 5 and 8 after IAV infection, and infected intranasally with 50,000 Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) conidia on d9 (Fig. 1). Mice received nebulized Pam2+ODN (P/O, 4 µM/1 µM) or phosphate-buffered saline (mock therapy) before and after AF super-infection (d8/d12). Therapeutic outcomes were assessed using a combined morbidity (viral pneumonia score ≥ 7/12) and mortality endpoint. On d14, nCounter-based transcriptomics with Ingenuity pathway enrichment analysis was performed on lung tissue, along with histopathology and flow cytometry. Event-free survival (A; Mantel-Cox log-rank test) and median viral pneumonia scores of survivors (B) depending on the treatment arm. Results All mock-treated mice with IAPA reached the morbidity/mortality endpoint by d13 (Fig. 2). Compared to CA-immunosuppressed mice with IAV infection only (100% survival), nCounter analysis revealed minimal incremental inflammatory response and suppression of several PRR pathways, interferon signaling, and neutrophil activation in the IAPA group. P/O therapy led to 80% event-free survival until d21 (p < 0.001 vs. mock therapy) and full recovery of all survivors (Fig. 2). Histopathology revealed significantly reduced fungal burden and hemorrhagic lesions in P/O-treated animals. nCounter analysis showed induction of PRR signaling, several key effector cytokine pathways, and epithelial signaling after P/O therapy. Moreover, nCounter and flow cytometry revealed enhanced recruitment of macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells in P/O-treated mice (Fig. 3). Summary of nCounter and flow cytometry results. Conclusion Consistent with previous studies in human IAPA patients, our data revealed severe immune paralysis in mice with IAPA. Immunotherapy with nebulized P/O strongly improved infection outcomes, enhanced mobilization of key immune effector cells, and re-invigorated PRR and cytokine signaling.

        <tr id="Cryptococcal-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS) is a clinical worsening or new presentation of cryptococcal disease following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. C-IRIS is primarily driven by an influx of pathological CD4+ T cells, which triggers a hyperinflammatory response. The murine model of C-IRIS is a way to study the disease in mice and understand how the immune system triggers life-threatening outcomes in patients. We previously developed a murine C-IRIS model and demonstrated that C-IRIS is triggered by pathological CD4+ T cells, particularly Th1 cells, in the brain, which triggers neurodegeneration and pulmonary dysfunction. Using this unique mouse model, we tested the therapeutic effect of a star-shaped glatiramer acetate (sGA), which is a more effective isomeric form than linear GA. Here, we observed that sGA suppresses Th1 differentiation in the lung tissues, reducing CD4+ T cell and Th1 cell count. It also reduced microglia populations in the brain. Together, these changes improved respiratory dysfunction caused by C-IRIS, lowered mortality rate, and reduced brain neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that sGA could be an effective therapeutic strategy for managing C-IRIS.">

        <tr id="Solid organ transplantation has significantly improved the survival rate of patients with terminal organ failure. However, its success is often compromised by allograft rejection, a process in which T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a crucial role. These cells facilitate rejection by enhancing neutrophil infiltration into the graft and by activating endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Additionally, Th17 cells can trigger the activation of other T cell types, including Th1, Th2, and CD8+ T cells, further contributing to rejection. An imbalance between Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is known to promote rejection. To counteract this, immunosuppressive drugs have been developed to inhibit T cell activity and foster transplant tolerance. Another approach involves the adoptive transfer of regulatory cells, such as Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, to dampen T cell functions. This review primarily focuses on the roles of Th17 cells in rejection and their interactions with other T cell subsets. We also explore various strategies aimed at suppressing T cells to induce tolerance.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells both play essential roles in controlling viral infections by eliminating virus-infected cells. Unlike CTLs, which require priming and activation by antigen-presenting cells, NK cells possess a remarkable capacity to mount a rapid antiviral immune response immediately after infection. Additionally, they can bolster the adaptive immune system by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with other immune cells. However, during chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, various immune cells, including NK cells, experience functional impairments. This has led to the exploration of NK cell-based immunotherapy as a promising strategy to reverse these dysfunctions and contribute to the pursuit of a functional cure for HIV. Building on the success of NK cell therapies in cancer treatment, these approaches offer significant potential for transforming the HIV cure field. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in NK cell-based immunotherapy for HIV, outlining the progress made and the key challenges that must be overcome to achieve a functional cure for people living with HIV.">

Perhaps, there is a unique immune cell phenotype for difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA). Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been considered for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This study focused on the uniqueness of D2T RA lymphocyte subsets and the feasibility of low-dose IL-2 therapy.Participants included 1,042 RA patients who were divided into three groups according to the presence or absence of treatment and their response to treatment in the last 6 months—new group, treated group, and D2T group—and 339 healthy controls (HCs). A total of 381 patients—107, 151, and 123 in each of the three experimental groups—received low-dose IL-2 treatment [0.5 million international units (MIU) per day, subcutaneous injection from day 1 to day 5]. The absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were detected by flow cytometry (FCM) and serum cytokine levels were detected by flow cytometry bead array (CBA).The absolute number of T, CD4+ T, and Treg cells in the D2T RA group was lower than that in the HC, new, and treated RA groups. Compared with the HC and new RA group, the ratio of Th17/Treg cells in the D2T RA group increased. The new, treated, and D2T RA groups had higher cytokine levels than the HC. The number of Treg cells in RA patients was negatively correlated with the disease activity index. Treg cells in the new, treated, and D2T RA groups could be increased by low-dose IL-2 therapy without any side effects.The number of lymphocytes and subsets in D2T RA patients was reduced, especially Treg cells, resulting in a shift in the balance of effector T cells/Treg cells toward effector T cells, which is ameliorated by low-dose IL-2 without obvious side effects.">

 Immunotherapies are a transformative force in clinical oncology, delivering prolonged disease-free survival in refractory cancers. However, in the setting of breast malignancies, clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are both low and ephemeral, particularly in the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtype. Effective responses are predicated on abundant neoantigens, the activity of immune effector cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the establishment of immunological memory. These prerequisites pose a significant efficacy barrier as BC patients carry low mutational burdens (neoantigens), and T-cells are profoundly hindered by the presence of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Radiotherapy (RT) holds a significant untapped potential to overcome the lack of neoantigens by triggering immunogenic cell death and recruiting adaptive immunity. However, the unavoidable tissue damage and clearance of dead cells by adjacent macrophages further enhance their wound-healing (immunosuppressive) phenotype, dampening the immunogenic potential of RT. Macrophages regulate immune responses through remarkably plastic activation states, including immune-stimulatory (M1) and immune-suppressive (M2). In breast tumors, macrophages undergo a well-documented but poorly understood “M2-education” process that facilitates immune evasion, utilizing a myriad of immune modulators (hormones, cytokines, and enzymes). Collectively, these dependencies highlight a tremendous therapeutic potential for combining RT with strategies that recover the M1 phenotype of TAMs, creating immune-supportive TME. Despite the potential, modulating TAM activities has proven exceptionally challenging, primarily due to the pleiotropic nature of their suppressive functions and the lack of scalable TME models to enable high-throughput target discovery. To overcome these limitations, we developed a scalable platform that recreates the breast TME at scale and phenotypic fidelity. This model contains the major BC constituents, including macrophages, tumor cells, and their supporting stroma, while preserving the functions, transcriptional programs, cell-cell interactions, and typical spatial organization. To identify reprogramming targets in TAMs, we performed a CRISPR screen utilizing Arg1 (a hallmark M2 marker) as a surrogate marker. Our screen exposed targets that convert immunosuppressive (M2) TAMs into immunostimulatory (M1) macrophages in established tumors. In vivo data show that TAM reprogramming is remarkably effective, promoting tumor regression and abscopal effect in HR+ and ovarian cancers. Reprogrammed TAMs enhanced responses to ICI and radiotherapy, a path we plan to optimize for future clinical development as “first-in-human” trials. Interventions that re-potentiate innate and adaptive immunities can benefit cancer patients, particularly those with limited therapeutic options. Our findings pioneer an actionable roadmap to unlock the full therapeutic potential of RT and immunotherapies in refractory human cancers.

Of note, the modulation of cytokine production and its release can significantly influence the immune response. Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are cytokines that play a crucial role in innate immunity due to their potent antiviral effects, regulation of IFN-stimulated genes essential for viral clearance, and the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, an understanding of the dual role of IFN-I (protective versus harmful) during HIV-1 infections and elucidating its contributions to HIV pathogenesis is crucial for advancing HIV therapeutic interventions. This review therefore delves into the intricate involvement of IFN-I in both the acute and chronic phases of HIV infection and emphasizes its impact on viral persistence, immune activation, and immunometabolism in treated HIV-infected individuals.">

Administered at birth, BCG induces broad immune responses against a large number of antigens shared with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but protection wanes over time. We have previously shown that unconventional B cell subsets play a role in tuberculosis control.High-dimensional flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine analysis were employed to investigate the effects of immunotherapy on BCG-vaccinated mice in an Mtb challenge model.In this study, we investigate the potential of recombinant cytokines targeting B cells – B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) – to modulate BCG immunity and improve protection in mice. Both cytokines play overlapping roles in B cell development and peripheral survival. Following subcutaneous BCG vaccination, immunotherapy with BAFF or APRIL resulted in an increased frequency of unconventional B cells potentially transitioning into antibody-producing plasma cells. Concurrently, we observed an increased frequency of central memory T cells, a subset critical for protective immunity. Changes in cellular immune responses were accompanied by reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles and a contraction of the leukocyte population in lungs. Importantly, mice receiving BCG vaccination followed by BAFF or APRIL immunotherapy exhibited superior long-term protection against pulmonary tuberculosis relative to controls that received only BCG.In summary, our findings demonstrate that combining BCG vaccination with B cell targeted immunomodulatory therapies can improve long-term protection against pulmonary tuberculosis, highlighting the continued relevance and underutilized potential of BCG as a vaccine platform.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects. Further research is expected to enhance the efficacy and safety of MSCs-based treatments for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="T cell-based therapies, including Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy (TIL), T cell receptor engineered T cells (TCR T), and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR T), are powerful therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. While these therapies are primarily known for their direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, accumulating evidence indicates that they also influence the tumor microenvironment (TME), by altering the cytokine milieu and recruiting additional effector populations to help orchestrate the antitumor immune response. Conversely, the TME itself can modulate the behaviour of these therapies within the host by either supporting or inhibiting their activity. In this review we provide an overview of clinical and preclinical data on the bidirectional influences between T cell therapies and the TME. Unravelling the interactions between T cell-based therapies and the TME is critical for a better understanding of their mechanisms of action, resistance, and toxicity, with the goal of optimizing efficacy and safety.">

        <tr id="Immunometabolism is an emerging field that explores the intricate interplay between immune cells and metabolism. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which maintain immune homeostasis in immunometabolism, play crucial regulatory roles. The activation, differentiation, and function of Tregs are influenced by various metabolic pathways, such as the Mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and glycolysis. Correspondingly, activated Tregs can reciprocally impact these metabolic pathways. Tregs also possess robust adaptive capabilities, thus enabling them to adapt to various microenvironments, including the tumor microenvironment (TME). The complex mechanisms of Tregs in metabolic diseases are intriguing, particularly in conditions like MASLD, where Tregs are significantly upregulated and contribute to fibrosis, while in diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), they show downregulation and reduced anti-inflammatory capacity. These phenomena suggest that the differentiation and function of Tregs are influenced by the metabolic environment, and imbalances in either can lead to the development of metabolic diseases. Thus, moderate differentiation and inhibitory capacity of Tregs are critical for maintaining immune system balance. Given the unique immunoregulatory abilities of Tregs, the development of targeted therapeutic drugs may position them as novel targets in immunotherapy. This could contribute to restoring immune system balance, resolving metabolic dysregulation, and fostering innovation and progress in immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is associated with germline RUNX1 mutations, establishing a preleukemic state and increasing the risk of developing leukemia. Currently, there are no intervention strategies to prevent leukemia progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 10) combined with functional analysis of samples from patients with RUNX1-FPD (n > 75) revealed that FPD hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) displayed increased myeloid differentiation and suppressed megakaryopoiesis because of increased activation of prosurvival and inflammatory pathways. Bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD contained an elevated cytokine milieu, exerting chronic inflammatory stress on HSPCs. RUNX1-FPD HSPCs were myeloid biased, had increased self-renewal, and were resistant to inflammation-mediated exhaustion. The bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD showed high transcript and protein expression of CD74 at the preleukemic stage compared with that of healthy controls, which remained high upon patient transformation into leukemia. Further, CD74-mediated signaling was exaggerated in RUNX1-FPD HSPCs compared with healthy controls, leading to the activation of mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways with increased cytokine production. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of CD74 with ISO-1 and its downstream targets JAK1/2 and mTOR reversed RUNX1-FPD differentiation defects in vitro and in vivo and reduced inflammation. Our results highlight that inflammation is an early event in RUNX1-FPD pathogenesis, and CD74 signaling is one of the drivers of this inflammation. The repurposing of JAK1/2i (ruxolitinib) and mTORi (sirolimus) and promoting the advancement of CD74 inhibitors in clinical settings as an early intervention strategy would be beneficial to improve the phenotype of patients with RUNX1-FPD and prevent myeloid progression.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with gastrectomy being the primary treatment option. Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, may influence tumor growth by creating an immunosuppressive environment conducive to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Here, the effect of abdominal infection on tumor growth and metastasis was investigated through the implementation of a peritoneal metastasis model and a subcutaneous tumor model. In a murine model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to simulate the effects of sepsis, we observed significant immune dysregulation, including T-cell exhaustion and the release of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). This immune alteration was associated with increased programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression on T cells and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment, fostering an immune-suppressive environment. Polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) expressing elevated PD-L1 after sepsis demonstrated more substantial suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation than controls. Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies successfully restored T-cell function, reduced mortality, and decreased metastasis in CLP mice. These findings emphasize the impact of sepsis on tumor progression and suggest targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a potential therapeutic strategy for managing immune dysfunction in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Natural killer (NK) cells are integral components of the innate immune system, serving a vital function in eliminating virally infected cells. This review highlights the significance of CXCR5+ NK cells in the context of chronic HIV/SIV infection and viral control.


RECENT FINDINGS
Controlled HIV/SHIV infection results in a substantial increase in the population of CXCR5+ NK cells within the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). These CXCR5+ NK cells display enhanced functional characteristics, including elevated expression of activation markers and increased cytokine production, which are essential for effective viral control. These follicular NK cells are shown to be enriched in IL-15 signaling, and CXCR5 NK cells are negatively associated with viral burden during chronic HIV and SHIV infection.


SUMMARY
The distinct phenotypic and functional attributes of CXCR5+ NK cells, particularly in the lymphoid tissues of individuals living with HIV, emphasize their critical contribution to the anti-HIV-1 immune response. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and roles of CXCR5+ NK cells may present novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing NK-mediated viral control.">

 Resident intestinal macrophages play a key role in maintaining gut homeostasis and exhibit a hypoactive tolerogenic phenotype. Recently, several subsets of intestinal macrophages have been identified based on CD11c expression which differ in their inflammatory and functional profiles. Notably, pro-inflammatory CD11c+ monocyte-like macrophages are found elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). These cells are recruited from blood monocytes via the CCR2/CCL2 chemokine pathway. Our study is focused on observing the patterns of CCL2-driven blood monocyte migration and their translation into subsets of intestinal tissue macrophages that can determine the degree of gut inflammation in newly diagnosed patients.



 Patients referred with suspected IBD were seen in an inception clinic. Intestinal biopsies and matched blood samples were obtained from pre-treatment UC and CD patients during their index colonoscopy. Those with inflammation excluded during this procedure formed a ‘non-IBD’ control group. Biopsy segments were cultured to generate conditioned media and also digested for flow cytometry analysis. Plasma concentrations of CCL2 and intestinal secretome were measured using ELISA or Olink proteomic analysis respectively. Efficacy of blood monocyte chemotaxis towards CCL2 was assessed in the presence or absence of CCL2/CCR2 antagonists and the profile of monocyte subsets in whole blood were determined using whole blood flow cytometry analysis.



 As previously described, we observed distinct CD11c+ and CD11c- macrophage populations in IBD intestinal tissue, with expansion of the CD11c+ subset within inflamed regions which expressed higher levels of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1. Higher concentrations of CCL2 were observed in conditioned media from inflamed IBD tissue compared to non-inflamed regions and this correlated with elevated numbers of circulating blood monocytes. Chemotaxis assays revealed a corresponding increase in CCL2-induced monocyte migration in patients with IBD compared to the ‘non-IBD’ control group.



 Our study provides further insights into the role of the CCL2/CCR2 chemokine axis in driving monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into pro-inflammatory intestinal macrophages in IBD. We demonstrate that inflamed intestinal regions exhibit elevated levels of CCL2 correlating with an expansion of the CD11c⁺ macrophage subset and increased CCL2-driven monocyte migration in these subjects. These findings underscore the significance of targeting the CCL2/CCR2 pathway and that it might be an important driver in the development IBD.

        <tr id="Purpose: The efficacy of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) patients is limited by acute toxicities, most notably cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Previous biomarker studies have been constrained by narrow protein panels and limited time points. We employed NULISATM, a novel ultrasensitive assay capable of simultaneously quantifying 204 proteins, to identify temporal proteome associations with acute toxicities in LBCL patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Experimental Design: Plasma samples from 80 LBCL patients who underwent anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, collected before and after cell infusion, were analyzed with NULISATM. Baseline demographics and treatment toxicities, including CRS and ICANS, were graded according to ASTCT consensus criteria. Differential protein abundance, pathway enrichment, and network analysis were performed. Results: Our analysis revealed higher levels of the chemokines CXCL1, CX3CL1, and CCL8 associated with severe toxicity within the first two days of treatment. Thereafter, severe toxicity was marked by more abundant Th2 cell effector cytokines, IL4, IL5 and IL-13, markers of exhaustion, and TNF receptor superfamily proteins CTLA4, PDCD1, CD274, LAG3, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, and CD40. Finally, patients with severe toxicities showed lower levels of cell growth factors PDGFA and EGF, and the neuronal repair protein BDNF at the resolution stage. Conclusions: This study represents the most comprehensive characterization of proteomic immune response to CAR T-cell therapy to date and identifies novel proteins, pathways, and networks associated with acute toxicity in the initiation and resolution phases, implicating them as potential biomarkers.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Innate immune cells are important players during an infection. The frequency of monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer (NK), and NKT cells were assessed in blood samples of children and adolescents living with HIV (CALHIV) and HIV-uninfected (HU) children. Blood samples from 10 CALHIV (treated or not) and six HU individuals were collected for approximately one year. Flow cytometry was employed to phenotypically characterize cell populations. We found a lower frequency of classical monocytes in CALHIV patients compared to the HU group (35.75% vs. 62.60%, respectively) but a higher frequency of CD56−CD16+ NK cells in CALHIV patients compared to the HU group (1.45% vs. 0.44%, respectively). At baseline, the frequency of monocytic-MDSCs inversely correlated with CD56dimCD16+ NK cells (r= −0.73, p=0.020), CD56−CD16+ NK cells (r= −0.78, p=0.010), and with intermediate monocytes (r= −0.71, p=0.027) in the CALHIV group. We also found a negative correlation between CD56++CD16+− and CD56dimCD16+ NK cells with CD4 T cells frequency at baseline. The results suggest an alteration in the innate compartment of the CALHIV cohort, which may contribute to their susceptibility to infections.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5)+CD8+ T cells represent a unique immune subset with dual roles, functioning as cytotoxic cells in persistent viral infections while promoting B cell responses. Despite their importance, the specific role of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells in chronic hepatitis B (CHB), particularly during interferon-alpha (IFN-α) treatment, is not fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between CXCR5+CD8+ T cells and sustained serologic response (SR) in patients undergoing 48 weeks of pegylated IFN-α (peg-IFN-α) treatment for CHB. AIM To elucidate the relationship between CXCR5+CD8+ T cells and sustained SR in patients undergoing 48 weeks of peg-IFN-α treatment for CHB. METHODS This study enrolled 60 patients with hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)-positive CHB undergoing 48 weeks of peg-IFN-α treatment. Participants were assessed for eligibility based on criteria such as persistent HBsAg-positive status for at least six months, HBeAb-negative, hepatitis B virus DNA levels exceeding 2 × 104 copies/mL, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels between 2 and 10 times the upper limit of normal. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, and a 24-week treatment-free follow-up (week 72) to measure serum interleukin (IL)-21 concentration via ELISA and to analyze CXCR5 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry, CXCR5 is a chemokine receptor that directs immune cells to specific tissues, while PD-L1 is a protein that regulates immune responses by inhibiting T cell activity. RESULTS Patients with CHB exhibited significantly lower levels of circulating CXCR5+CD8+ T cells compared to healthy controls (P < 0.01). Notably, CXCR5+CD8+ T cells were prominently expressed in patients who achieved sustained SR compared to non-SR (NSR). A significant correlation was observed between CXCR5 and PD-L1 expression (r = -0.189, P = 0.002). However, there was no significant correlation between serum IL-21 levels and CXCR5+CD8+ lymphocytes (r = -0.03, P = 0.625) or serum ALT levels (r = 0.026, P = 0.678). CONCLUSION The enhanced expression of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells in patients achieving HBeAg seroconversion during IFN-α treatment suggests that these cells play a crucial role in antiviral immune responses against hepatitis B. This study highlights the potential of CXCR5+CD8+ T cells as immune regulators in CHB, which may inform future therapeutic strategies to optimize antiviral treatments.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the dynamic interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses but their function is dysregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[1-4]. The mechanism that contributes to NK-cell dysregulation in IBD requires further elucidation.



 Using flow cytometry staining, we precisely characterized the frequency, phenotype and function of NK subsets distinguished by CD27 and CD11b in 61 treatment-naive patients with active IBD (including 34 with Crohn’ s disease (CD) and 27 with ulcerative colitis (UC)), as compared to 30 healthy volunteers.



 We observed a significantly increased proportion of the peripheral CD11b-CD27- (double-negative, or DN) NK subsets in IBD patients. Notably, these relatively expanded DN NK subsets exhibited an inactive and immature phenotype. Functional analysis, conducted by stimulating and assessing the expression of CD107a and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), revealed that the DN NK subsets had poor cytotoxic capacity and a deficient potential to produce IFN-γ. In addition, the percentages of DN NK subsets expressing CD107a and IFN-γ were positively correlated with NK degranulation and cytokine production, respectively. Interestingly, we also found that the frequency of DN NK subsets seemed to correlate with the plasma levels of IL-17A. High levels of IL-17A constrain the proliferation and maturation of NK cells in vitro. In some IBD patients who achieved clinical remission after receiving biological agent therapy, the percentage of DN NK subsets decreased accordingly.



 The increased proportion of DN NK subsets may account for NK-cell dysfunction in IBD patients, potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of IL-17A. These alterations in NK cell subsets may contribute to defective killing and thus the secondary infections and increased risk of cancer observed in IBD patients.

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) are autoimmune diseases managed with long-term immunosuppressive therapies. Hu19-CD828Z, a fully human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with a CD28 costimulatory domain, is engineered to potently deplete B-cells. In this study, we manufactured Hu19-CD828Z CAR T-cells from peripheral blood of SLE, IIM, and SSc patients and healthy donors (HDs). CAR-mediated, CD19-specific activity of these cells was evaluated in vitro by assessing cytotoxicity, cytokine release, and proliferation assays in response to autologous CD19+ B-cells, the CD19+ NALM-6 B-cell line, or a CD19− U937 non-B-cell line as targets. The results demonstrated an increased proliferation of Hu19-CD828Z CAR T-cells and dose-dependent cytotoxicity against primary autologous and NALM-6 B-cells compared to non-transduced controls or co-cultures with non-B-cells. Notably, autoimmune-patient-derived CAR T-cells produced lower levels of inflammatory cytokines than healthy-donor-derived CAR T-cells in response to CD19+ B-cell targets. These data support the potential of Hu19-CD828Z and its therapeutic cell product KYV-101 as a therapeutic strategy to achieve deep B-cell depletion in SLE, IIM, and SSc patients, and highlights its promise for broader application in B-cell-driven autoimmune disorders.">

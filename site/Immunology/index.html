        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Memory CD4 T cells are critical to human immunity, yet it is unclear whether viral inflammation during memory formation has long-term consequences. Here, we compared transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of Spike (S)–specific memory CD4 T cells in 24 individuals whose first exposure to S was via SARS-CoV-2 infection or mRNA vaccination. Nearly 2 years after memory formation, S-specific CD4 T cells established by infection remained enriched for transcripts related to cytotoxicity and for interferon-stimulated genes, likely because of a chromatin accessibility landscape altered by inflammation. Moreover, S-specific CD4 T cells primed by infection had reduced proliferative capacity in vitro relative to vaccine-primed cells. Furthermore, the transcriptional state of S-specific memory CD4 T cells was minimally altered by booster immunization and/or breakthrough infection. Thus, infection-associated inflammation durably imprints CD4 T cell memory, which affects the function of these cells and may have consequences for long-term immunity. High-grade inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts a durable transcriptional and epigenetic imprint on memory CD4 T cells. Editor’s summary It is unclear whether the memory CD4 T cells generated via mRNA vaccination and via SARS-CoV-2 infection are comparable in terms of frequency and function. Gray-Gaillard et al. performed single-cell analysis of spike protein (S)–specific memory CD4 T cells taken from a longitudinal sample of individuals variously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 or naturally infected with the virus. Infection-primed S-specific memory CD4 T cells exhibited a durable transcriptional and epigenetic signature of inflammation, a cytotoxic profile, and a proliferative disadvantage compared with vaccine-primed memory CD4 T cells. Breakthrough infections did not generally alter the transcriptional profile of vaccine-primed memory T cells, although re-exposure to antigen accompanied by high levels of inflammation could alter the transcriptional profiles of these cells in a clonotype-specific manner. —Seth Thomas Scanlon">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The adjuvant AS01 plays a key role in the immunogenicity of several approved human vaccines with demonstrated high efficacy. Its adjuvant effect relies on activation of the innate immune system. However, specific effects of AS01-adjuvanted vaccines on innate cell function and epigenetic remodeling, as described for Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and influenza vaccines, are still unknown. We assessed the long-term functional and epigenetic changes in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells induced by a model vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen and AS01 in healthy adults (NCT01777295). The AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, but not an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine, increased the number of circulating monocytes and their expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DR, which correlated with the magnitude of the memory CD4+ T cell response. Single-cell analyses revealed epigenetic alterations in monocyte and dendritic cell subsets, affecting accessibility of transcription factors involved in cell functions including activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA, C/EBP, and interferon regulatory factor. The functional changes were characterized by a reduced proinflammatory response to Toll-like receptor activation and an improved response to interferon-γ, a cytokine critical for the adjuvant’s mode of action. Epigenetic changes were most evident shortly after the second vaccine dose in CD14+ monocytes, for which accessibility differences of some transcription factors could persist for up to 6 months postvaccination. Together, we show that reprogramming of monocyte subsets occurs after vaccination with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, an effect that may contribute to the impact of vaccination beyond antigen-specific protection. An AS01-adjuvanted vaccine for hepatitis B virus modifies the epigenetic landscape of monocytes isolated from clinical study participants. Editor’s summary Most vaccines based on recombinant antigens rely on coadministration with an adjuvant to elicit a robust immune response. Although adjuvants are needed for many vaccines, it is less clear which adjuvant(s) should be paired with each immunogen. In two papers, Bechtold et al. and Arunachalam et al. performed comparative analyses to assess the effect of different adjuvants on the immune response. Bechtold et al. showed that an AS01-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus vaccine, which induces robust CD4+ T cell responses against the vaccine antigen, also elicited trained immunity in human recipients, which was not observed in an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine. Arunachalam et al. found that Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum adjuvantation induced robust immune responses to the R21 malaria vaccine in nonhuman primates, but a third comparator, GLA-LSQ, elicited a lower magnitude of response that was short lived. Although Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum induced robust and durable antibody responses, they elicited distinct innate immune responses, demonstrating that multiple innate immune mechanisms can program durable vaccine-induced immunity. These head-to-head comparisons in both humans and nonhuman primates demonstrate that selecting an adjuvant should be done carefully and that different adjuvants have distinct effects on both innate and adaptive immunity. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

Despite their importance, their physiological role in the upper respiratory tract, the first site of contact with IAV, remains unclear. Here, we find that, after IAV infection, antigen-specific CD4 TRM persist in the nasal tissue (NT) compartment and play a prime role in local viral clearance. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that NT CD4 TRM are heterogeneous and transcriptionally distinct as compared to their lung counterparts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the CXCR6- CXCL16 axis is involved in CD4 TRM residency in the NT. Furthermore, we show that the NT of mice and humans contains a high frequency of IL-17-producing CD4 TRM that aid in local viral clearance and in reducing tissue damage. Collectively, our results support a robust physiological role for nasal tissue CD4 TRM in preventing IAV infection.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is most recognized for its impact on the central nervous system. However, recent breakthroughs underscore the crucial role of interactions between central and peripheral systems in PD’s pathogenesis. The spotlight is now shifting as we explore beyond the central nervous system, discovering that peripheral changes such as inflammatory dysfunctions may predict the rate of disease progression and severity. Despite more than 200 years of research on PD, reliable diagnostic or progression biomarkers and effective disease-modifying treatments are still lacking. Additionally, the cellular mechanisms that drive changes in immunity are largely unknown. Thus, understanding peripheral immune signatures could lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatments for PD. Here, we sought to define the transcriptomic alterations of the complete peripheral immune cell compartment by single-cell RNA- and T-cell receptor-sequencing with hopes of uncovering PD signatures and potential peripheral blood biomarkers. Following transcriptional profiling of 78 876 cells from 10 healthy controls and 14 PD donors, we observed five major classes of immune cell types; myeloid (monocytes, dendritic cells) and lymphoid (T, B, natural killer) cells from which we identified 38 cellular subtypes following bioinformatic re-clustering. Comparing immune cell subtypes and phenotypes between PD patients and healthy controls revealed notable features of PD: 1) a significant shift of classical CD14+ monocytes towards an activated CD14+/CD83+ state, 2) changes in lymphocyte subtype abundance, including a significant decrease in CD4+ naive and mucosal-associated invariant T-cells subtypes, along with an increase in CD56+ natural killer cells, 3) the identification by T-cell receptor sequencing of several PD specific T-cell clones shared between multiple patients, suggesting the implication of common epitopes in PD pathogenesis, 4) a notable increase in the expression of activation signature genes, including the AP-1 stress-response transcription factor complex, across all PD cell types. This signal was not present in atypical parkinsonism patients with multiple systems atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy. Overall, we present a comprehensive atlas of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from control and PD patients which should serve as a tool to improve our understanding of the role the immune cell landscape plays in PD pathogenesis.">

Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells.

However, information on how meningeal immunocytes guard brain homeostasis in healthy individuals remains sparse. This study highlights the heterogeneous and polyfunctional regulatory-T (Treg) cell compartment in the meninges. A Treg subtype specialized in controlling Th1-cell responses and another known to control responses in B-cell follicles were substantial components of this compartment, foretelling that punctual Treg-cell ablation rapidly unleashed interferon-gamma production by meningeal lymphocytes, unlocked their access to the brain parenchyma, and altered meningeal B-cell profiles. Distally, the hippocampus assumed a reactive state, with morphological and transcriptional changes in multiple glial-cell types; within the dentate gyrus, neural stem cells showed exacerbated death and desisted from further differentiation, associated with inhibition of spatial-reference memory. Thus, meningeal Treg cells are a multifaceted bulwark to brain homeostasis at steady-state.

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have heralded a remarkable shift in cancer care, significantly extending survival for advanced cancer patients. However, despite their remarkable clinical successes, a substantial majority of patients fail to achieve a lasting response to ICIs. To address this challenge and gain insights into the complex landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME), we conducted an extensive analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA; ∼216K cells across 39 samples) and single-nucleus transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC; ∼43K cells from 15 samples) in a metastatic melanoma cohort. This systematic approach delineates 14 distinct cell types and 55 cell subtypes, including the identification of 15 transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells. Through correlation analysis of cell subtype proportions, we unveiled six distinct clusters associated with varying tumor responses. Particularly intriguing was the identification of the mature DC enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) subtype exhibiting correlations with naive T and B cells, forming an anti-tumor program that underscores the importance of multiple immune cell types in mediating anti-tumor immunity. Notably, we found that mregDC abundance represents a good prognostic predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) in the context of ICI treatment, and when combined with the TCF7+/- CD8 T cell ratio, it reliably predicts patient PFS across treatments beyond ICI. We validated our findings using an independent cohort of 274 ICI-treated melanoma samples analyzed using tissue-level expression. We next compared mregDCs and conventional dendritic cell types 1 and 2 (cDC1 and cDC2) using transcriptome signature, differentiation trajectory, interactome, cytokine milieu, and epigenome landscape analyses. This comparative analysis shed light on the unique attributes of mregDCs within the TME. Finally, we investigated cell type/subtype-specific genes, pathways, immune response enrichment, and ligand-receptor interactions closely associated with the proportions of mregDCs within the TME. These molecular and cellular insights, with their critical roles in enhancing the immune response against cancer, offer valuable prospects for predicting the efficacy of ICI regimens, and potentially guiding the selection of rational combinatorial therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses a formidable challenge in stroke management, with limited therapeutic options, particularly in the realm of immune‐targeted interventions. Clinical trials targeting immune responses post‐ICH have encountered setbacks, potentially attributable to the substantial cellular heterogeneity and intricate intercellular networks within the brain. Here, we present a pioneering investigation utilizing single‐cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome profiling at hyperacute (1 h), acute (24 h), and subacute (7 days) intervals post‐ICH, aimed at unraveling the dynamic immunological landscape and spatial distributions within the cerebral tissue. Our comprehensive analysis revealed distinct cell differentiation patterns among myeloid and lymphocyte populations, along with delineated spatial distributions across various brain regions. Notably, we identified a subset of lymphocytes characterized by the expression of Spp1 and Lyz2, termed macrophage‐associated lymphocytes, which exhibited close interactions with myeloid cells. Specifically, we observed prominent interactions between Lgmn+Macro‐T cells and microglia through the spp1–cd44 pathway during the acute phase post‐ICH in the choroid plexus. These findings represent a significant advancement in our understanding of immune cell dynamics at single‐cell resolution across distinct post‐ICH time points, thereby laying the groundwork for exploring critical temporal windows and informing the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) represent an urgent public health challenge and are estimated to affect more than 60 million individuals globally. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood-based studies, with few focusing on samples derived from affected tissues. Furthermore, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal mechanisms. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we comprehensively compared bronchoalveolar lavage fluid single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from clinical PASC samples and a mouse model of PASC. This revealed a pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC, as well as abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells, in both humans and mice. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in respiratory PASC. Neutralizing IFN-γ after the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced lung inflammation and tissue fibrosis in mice. Together, our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the cause of PASC and suggests that the IFN-γ signaling axis might represent a therapeutic target. Comparative scRNA-seq analysis, combined with functional experiments in an animal model, identified IFN-γ as a target for respiratory PASC. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a myriad of symptoms that a person may experience after an acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also referred to as postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The specific drivers of these symptoms are unclear, complicating the development of therapeutics for those suffering from this condition. Here, Li et al. used comparative analysis to interrogate a potential driver of respiratory PASC, one of the most debilitating types of PASC. The authors found that humans with respiratory PASC had evidence of an enhanced monocyte-derived macrophage response in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A similar phenotype was observed in aged C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. This phenotype in mice could be reduced by anti–interferon-γ (anti–IFN-γ) treatment initiated after the resolution of acute disease, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for humans. —Courtney Malo">

Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages recruited to pathogen-infected lungs, including SARS-CoV-2–infected lungs, express phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), a signaling protein that coordinates both granulocyte and monocyte trafficking to diseased tissues and immune-suppressive, profibrotic transcription in myeloid cells. PI3Kγ deletion and inhibition with the clinical PI3Kγ inhibitor eganelisib promoted survival in models of infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 and MRSA, by suppressing inflammation, vascular leak, organ damage, and cytokine storm. These results demonstrate essential roles for PI3Kγ in inflammatory lung disease and support the potential use of PI3Kγ inhibitors to suppress inflammation in severe infectious diseases. PI3Kγ inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation associated with severe infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Editor’s summary Respiratory diseases caused by different infectious agents can look similar and can rely on similar therapeutic approaches to dampen inflammation. Here, Shepard et al. identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) as a protein that is up-regulated in innate immune cells in the lungs of individuals with COVID-19. They further showed that this was not a COVID-19–specific marker because PI3Kγ was up-regulated in mice infected with other pathogens and after sterile inflammation. PI3Kγ inhibition promoted survival across distinct mouse models of respiratory inflammation and reduced inflammation and vascular leak in the lungs of these animals. These data, which span across human and murine studies, suggest that PI3Kγ inhibition may be an effective host-directed therapy for lung inflammation. —Courtney Malo">

Here we examine the roles of the prototypic pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and IL-10 using the rhesus macaque model of mild COVID-19. We find that IFNγ drives the development of 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lesions in the lungs as measured by PET/CT imaging but is not required for suppression of viral replication. In contrast, IL-10 limits the duration of acute pulmonary lesions, serum markers of inflammation and the magnitude of virus-specific T cell expansion but does not impair viral clearance. We also show that IL-10 induces the subsequent differentiation of virus-specific effector T cells into CD69+CD103+ tissue resident memory cells (Trm) in the airways and maintains Trm cells in nasal mucosal surfaces, highlighting an unexpected role for IL-10 in promoting airway memory T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection of macaques.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a heterogeneous population of cells whose phenotypes and functions are shaped by factors that are incompletely understood. Herein, we asked when and where TAMs arise from blood monocytes and how they evolve during tumor development. We initiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in inducible monocyte fate-mapping mice and combined single-cell transcriptomics and high-dimensional flow cytometry to profile the monocyte-to-TAM transition. We revealed that monocytes differentiate first into a transient intermediate population of TAMs that generates two longer-lived lineages of terminally differentiated TAMs with distinct gene expression profiles, phenotypes, and intratumoral localization. Transcriptome datasets and tumor samples from patients with PDAC evidenced parallel TAM populations in humans and their prognostic associations. These insights will support the design of new therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs in PDAC. Intermediate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) emerge first and give rise to two more differentiated TAM populations in pancreatic cancer. Editor’s summary Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and immune suppression, but how TAMs develop from circulating monocytes and local tissue-resident macrophages remains incompletely understood. Using a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in monocyte fate-mapping mice, Dunsmore et al. examined the dynamics of the monocyte-to-macrophage transition in tumors. A population of “intermediate” TAMs gave rise to two more differentiated TAM subsets, distinguishable by their distinct surface marker phenotype, dependence on the transcription factor Maf, migratory behavior, and localization in tumors. These findings provide a time- and space-resolved picture of TAM heterogeneity and development in PDAC, which could guide the future development of TAM-targeted therapeutic strategies. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Memory T cells are a highly dynamic and heterogeneous population that is maintained by cytokine-driven homeostatic proliferation interspersed with episodes of antigen-mediated expansion and contraction which affect their functional state and their durability. This heterogeneity complicates studies on the impact of aging on global human memory cells, specifically, it is unclear how aging drives memory T cell dysfunction. Here, we used chronic infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to assess the influence of age on memory states at the level of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. We find that in young adults (<40 years), EBV-specific CD8+ T cells assume preferred differentiation states depending on their peptide specificity. By age >65-years, different T cell specificities had undergone largely distinct aging trajectories, which had in common a loss in adaptive and a gain in innate immunity signatures. No evidence was seen for cellular senescence or exhaustion. While naïve/stem-like EBV-specific T cells disappeared with age, T cell diversity of EBV-specific memory cells did not change or even increased. In summary, by controlling for antigen specificity we uncover age-associated shifts in gene expression and TCR diversity that have implications for optimizing vaccination strategies and adoptive T cell therapy.">

Our understanding of factors regulating TOX expression and the transition from progenitor to terminal exhaustion, however, remains incomplete. We reveal here that T cell upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (TNFR2) coincides with the gain of phenotypic markers and functions reflective of terminal exhaustion. Meanwhile, knocking out TNFR2 affords a novel population of T cells that express TIM3 but possess diminished TOX levels and functional characteristics of both progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. TIM3+ TNFR2 KO T cells exhibit reduced exhaustion transcriptional programs and enhanced AP1 pathway signatures. Finally, TNFR2 KO mice demonstrate improved T cell-dependent control of tumor and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral (cLCMV) infection, while pharmacologic antagonism of TNFR2 licenses responses to checkpoint blockade in multiple tumor models.">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

The immune component dynamics during treatment and how it correlated with treatment efficacy remained largely known. We hypothesize that understanding the modulation dynamics of the TME upon ICI treatment would be key to elucidate the mechanisms of response and resistance. To systematically characterize these dynamics, we aggregated a large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of 141 patients across multiple cancer types and ICI treatment modalities, with longitudinally paired samples. We developed a robust, integration-free, and cluster-free deep phenotyping framework, leveraging multiple pan-cancer references to annotate 876,410 high-quality cells into 80 granular cell states. Our analysis revealed consistent compositional changes in 17 cell subtypes following ICI treatment, including an enhanced adaptive immune response such as CD8+ IL7R+ central memory T cells, GZMK+ effector memory T cells, germinal center B cells, precursor exhausted T cells, and CD4+ TfhTh1 cells, accompanied by a broad reduction in interferon responsive immune cells quiescent CD4+CREM-memory T cells. We uncovered co-regulated cell communities within the TME, highlighting the coordinated interplay between adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as immune and non-immune components. Furthermore, we identified two distinct patient groups exhibiting tightly correlated cellular dynamics within the TME post-treatment. The first group, enriched for responders, displayed a marked expansion of naive lymphocytes, while the second group, predominantly composed of non-responders, showed an increased abundance of immune experienced/suppressive cell states. This dichotomy in TME dynamics offers a potential predictive biomarker for patient stratification and personalized therapeutic strategies. Our study presents a comprehensive landscape of the cellular dynamics within the TME during ICI treatment, enabled by a powerful deep phenotyping approach showcasing the importance of a systems-level understanding of the TME dynamics in improving patient stratification and advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy.">

Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that Id2-deficiency in T cells caused parasite-specific Trm to develop an altered phenotype with diminished effector functions and reduced expression of CD49a. Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

        <tr id="Accumulating evidence suggests that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) significantly influences the response to immunotherapy, yet this complex relationship remains elusive. To address this issue, we developed TimiGP-Response (TIME Illustration based on Gene Pairing designed for immunotherapy Response), a computational framework leveraging single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data, along with response information, to construct cell-cell interaction networks associated with responders and estimate the role of immune cells in treatment response. This framework was showcased in triple-negative breast cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1:PD-L1 interaction, and orthogonally validated with imaging mass cytometry. As a result, we identified CD8+ GZMB+ T cells associated with responders and its interaction with regulatory T cells emerged as a potential feature for selecting patients who may benefit from these therapies. Subsequently, we analyzed 3,410 patients with seven cancer types (melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, metastatic urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer) treated with various immunotherapies and combination therapies, as well as several chemo- and targeted therapies as controls. Using TimiGP-Response, we depicted the pan-cancer immune landscape associated with immunotherapy response at different resolutions. At the TIME level, CD8 T cells and CD4 memory T cells were associated with responders, while anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages and mast cells were linked to non-responders across most cancer types and datasets. Given that T cells are the primary targets of these immunotherapies and our TIME analysis highlights their importance in response to treatment, we portrayed the pan-caner landscape on 40 T cell subtypes. Notably, CD8+ and CD4+ GZMK+ effector memory T cells emerged as crucial across all cancer types and treatments, while IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells were top candidates associated with immunotherapy non-responders. In summary, this study provides a computational method to study the association between TIME and response across the pan-cancer immune landscape, offering resources and insights into immune cell interactions and their impact on treatment efficacy.">

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Immunotherapeutics targeting T cells are crucial for inhibiting autoimmune disease progression proximal to disease onset in type 1 diabetes. A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

        <tr id="Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a dual role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, aiding early immune defense but also contributing to lung damage. While NET targeting may improve clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, its impact on adaptive immunity, crucial for fighting the virus, remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that both recombinant human DNase (rhDNase), degrading NET structure, and GSK484, inhibiting NET formation, reduce lung NET concentration and improve clinical outcomes in infected mice, yet they differ in their influence on T cell responses. We show that rhDNase does not impact T cell responses, whereas GSK484 diminishes virus-specific T cell responses. In vitro, GSK484 decreases dendritic cell antigen presentation by impairing antigen uptake and reduces IL-2 signaling by affecting its production by T cells. In a model of lung inflammation, GSK484 diminishes antigen-specific T cell activation and proliferation, while rhDNase shows a potential to boost T cell responses via the presence of NET fragments that reduce T cell activation threshold. Our findings suggest that NET targeting with rhDNase or GSK484 holds therapeutic potential for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, while their distinct modes of action shape T cell responses during the infection.">

        <tr id="The cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a pivotal T cell-derived signal crucial for germinal center (GC) responses, but the precise mechanisms by which IL-21 influences B cell function remain elusive. Here, we investigated the B cell-intrinsic role of IL-21 signaling by employing a novel IL-21 receptor (Il21r) conditional knock-out mouse model and ex vivo culture systems and uncovered a surprising duality of IL-21 signaling in B cells. While IL-21 stimulation of naïve B cells led to Bim-dependent apoptosis, it promoted robust proliferation of pre-activated B cells, particularly class-switched IgG1+ B cells ex vivo. Consistent with this, B cell-specific deletion of Il21r led to a severe defect in IgG1 responses in vivo following immunization. Intriguingly, Il21r-deleted B cells are significantly impaired in their ability to transition from a pre-GC to a GC state following immunization. Although Il21r-deficiency did not affect the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among GC B cells, it greatly diminished the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among the plasmablast/plasma cell population. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-21 serves as a critical regulator of B cell fates, influencing B cell apoptosis and proliferation in a context-dependent manner.">

        <tr id="Pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells are major drivers of autoimmune diseases, yet therapies modulating T cell phenotypes to promote an anti-inflammatory state are lacking. Here, we identify T helper 17 (TH17) cell plasticity in the kidneys of patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated glomerulonephritis on the basis of single-cell (sc) T cell receptor analysis and scRNA velocity. To uncover molecules driving T cell polarization and plasticity, we established an in vivo pooled scCRISPR droplet sequencing (iCROP-seq) screen and applied it to mouse models of glomerulonephritis and colitis. CRISPR-based gene targeting in TH17 cells could be ranked according to the resulting transcriptional perturbations, and polarization biases into T helper 1 (TH1) and regulatory T cells could be quantified. Furthermore, we show that iCROP-seq can facilitate the identification of therapeutic targets by efficient functional stratification of genes and pathways in a disease- and tissue-specific manner. These findings uncover TH17 to TH1 cell plasticity in the human kidney in the context of renal autoimmunity. A single-cell in vivo CRISPR screen highlights genes driving T cell tissue adaptation and plasticity in autoimmunity. Editor’s summary Modulating plasticity in pathogenic T cells to promote a tolerogenic phenotype is a promising therapeutic approach in autoimmunity and cancer. To explore how pathogenic TH17 cell plasticity is regulated in mouse models of kidney and gut inflammation, Enk et al. optimized an in vivo pooled single-cell CRISPR droplet sequencing (iCROP-seq) screen. iCROP-seq enabled the assessment and quantification of CRISPR-modified TH17 cell polarization states in vivo. Furthermore, T cells from patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated glomerulonephritis exhibited plasticity. These findings indicate that iCROP-seq can be applied to preclinical mouse models of inflammation and suggest that targeting TH17 plasticity in patients with ANCA-glomerulonephritis is a promising therapeutic approach. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

While infections robustly elicit both types of immunity, currently approved vaccine adjuvants largely fail to induce T cell responses on par with that instigated by infections. Our goal was to investigate the transcriptional programming that supports the formation of CD8+ T cells elicited by subunit vaccines compared to those elicited by infections. Our data show that vaccine-elicited T cells represent a transcriptionally unique subset of activated T cells with high proliferative capacity and a memory cell fate. This relies on IL-27 signaling, which stabilizes c-Myc and thereby supports the biomass acquisition necessary for clonal expansion. Collectively, our findings reveal that subunit vaccine-elicited T cells uniquely combine aspects of both memory and effector T cell subsets, and selectively utilize IL-27 signaling to sustain the clonal expansion of cells dedicated to a memory fate. One Sentence Summary In contrast to infection, subunit vaccines induce a distinct population of CD8+ T cells with memory fate characteristics which maintain their proliferative capacity during the expansion phase through IL-27 receptor signaling.">

Infected patients show strong systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. NK cells are highly activated in HFRS, suggesting that also other innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) might be responding to infection. Here, we characterized peripheral ILC responses, and measured plasma levels of soluble factors and plasma viral load, in 17 Puumala virus (PUUV)-infected HFRS patients. This revealed an increased frequency of ILC2 in patients, in particular the ILC2 lineage-committed c-Kitlo ILC2 subset. Patients’ ILCs showed an activated profile with increased proliferation and displayed altered expression of several homing markers. How ILCs are activated during viral infection is largely unknown. When analyzing PUUV-mediated activation of ILCs in vitro we observed that this was dependent on type I interferons, suggesting a role for type I interferons—produced in response to virus infection–in the activation of ILCs. Further, stimulation of naïve ILC2s with IFN-β affected ILC2 cytokine responses in vitro, causing decreased IL-5 and IL-13, and increased IL-10, CXCL10, and GM-CSF secretion. These results show that ILCs are activated in HFRS patients and suggest that the classical antiviral type I IFNs are involved in shaping ILC functions.">

We previously identified high levels of LAIR2, a decoy protein for the inhibitory receptor LAIR1, in advanced CTCL. Mice do not have a LAIR2 homolog, so we used Lair1 knock-out (KO) mice to model LAIR2 overexpression. In a model of subcutaneous S. aureus skin infection, Lair1 KO mice had significantly larger abscesses and areas of dermonecrosis compared to WT. Lair1 KO exhibited a pattern of increased inflammatory responses in infection and sterile immune stimulation, including increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and myeloid chemokines, neutrophil ROS, and collagen/ECM remodeling pathways. Notably, Lair1 KO infected skin had a similar bacterial burden and neutrophils and monocytes had equivalent S. aureus phagocytosis compared to WT. These findings support a model in which lack of LAIR1 signaling causes an excessive inflammatory response that does not improve infection control. CTCL skin lesions harbored similar patterns of increased expression in cytokine and collagen/ECM remodeling pathways, suggesting that high levels of LAIR2 in CTCL recapitulates Lair1 KO, causing inflammatory tissue damage and compromising host defense against S. aureus infection.">

        <tr id="Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which coexists as four genetically and immunologically distinct serotypes (DENV1-4). In secondary heterologous DENV infection, pre-existing immunity is believed to contribute to severe disease through antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Although the elevated pathology observed in ADE conditions has been described, the cell intrinsic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. Using scRNAseq, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected by DENV via ADE compared to conventional infection conditions. Unsupervised analysis of scRNAseq data enabled the identification and differentiation of infected and bystander/uninfected cells in a heterogeneous cell culture. Differential gene expression and Ingenuity Pathway analyses revealed a number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes and gene networks between cells infected by ADE compared to conventional infection. Specifically, these pathways indicated mechanisms such as suppressed interferon signaling and inflammatory chemokine transcription in cells infected via ADE. Further analysis revealed that transcriptomic changes were independent of viral RNA within infected cells, suggesting that the observed changes are reflective of cell-intrinsic responses and not simply a function of per-cell viral burden. Bystander cells in ADE conditions also demonstrated distinct profiles, indicating an immunologically activated phenotype enriched for the expression of gene networks involved with protein translation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Together, these findings support the concept that DENV infection via ADE induces a qualitatively different transcriptomic response in infected and bystander cells, contributing to our understanding of ADE as a mechanistic driver of disease and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen with a significant and growing global health burden. Although correlates of severe dengue disease are poorly understood, pre-existing immunity to DENV has been associated with severe disease risk and known to contribute to an alternative route of viral entry termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic processes involved in antibody-mediated DENV entry compared to conventional receptor mediated entry. These data provide meaningful insight into the discrete processes contributing to DENV pathogenesis in ADE conditions.">

        <tr id="Objective Beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the combined effect of inflammation and recurrent autoimmunity. In recent years, the role played by beta cells in the development of T1D has evolved from passive victims of the immune system to active contributors in their own destruction. We and others have demonstrated that perturbations in the islet microenvironment promote endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in beta cells, leading to enhanced immunogenicity. Among the underlying mechanisms, secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by beta cells has been suggested to mediate the crosstalk with the immune cell compartment. Methods To study the role of cellular stress in the early events of T1D development, we generated a novel cellular model for constitutive ER stress by modulating the expression of HSPA5, which encodes BiP/GRP78, in EndoC-βH1 cells. To investigate the role of EVs in the interaction between beta cells and the immune system, we characterized the EV miRNA cargo and evaluated their effect on innate immune cells. Results Analysis of the transcriptome showed that HSPA5 knockdown resulted in the upregulation of signaling pathways involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and changes the miRNA content of EVs, including reduced levels of miRNAs involved in IL-1β signaling. Treatment of primary human monocytes with EVs from stressed beta cells resulted in increased surface expression of CD11b, HLA-DR, CD40 and CD86 and upregulation of IL-1β and IL-6. Conclusion These findings indicate that the content of EVs derived from stressed beta cells can be a mediator of islet inflammation.">

        <tr id="Immune signalling is a crucial component in the progression of fibrosis. However, approaches for the safety assessment of potentially profibrotic substances, providing information on mechanistic immune responses, are underdeveloped. This study utilises a comprehensive analysis of RNA sequencing data from macrophages exposed in vitro to multiple sublethal concentrations of the profibrotic agent bleomycin, over multiple timepoints. Using a toxicogenomic framework, we performed dose-dependent analysis to filter genes truly altered by bleomycin exposure from noise and identified a subset of immune genes with a sustained dose-dependent and differential expression response to profibrotic challenge. We performed an immunoassay and revealed cytokines and proteinases responding to bleomycin exposure that closely correlate to transcriptomic alterations, underscoring the integration between transcriptional immune response and external immune signalling activity. This study not only increases our understanding of the immunological mechanisms of fibrosis, but also offers an innovative framework for the toxicological evaluation of substances with potential fibrogenic effects on macrophage signalling. Our work brings a new immunotoxicogenomic direction for hazard assessment of fibrotic compounds, through implementation of a time and resource efficient in vitro methodology.">

        <tr id="Background: Neutrophils are key mediators of inflammation during acute liver injury (ALI). Emerging evidence suggests that they also contribute to injury resolution and tissue repair. However, the different neutrophil subsets involved in these processes and their kinetics are undefined. Herein, we characterized neutrophil kinetics and heterogeneity during ALI. Methods: We used the carbon tetrachloride model of ALI and employed flow cytometry, tissue imaging, and quantitative RT-PCR to characterize intrahepatic neutrophils during the necroinflammatory early and late repair phases of the wound healing response to ALI. We FACS sorted intrahepatic neutrophils at key time points and examined their transcriptional profiles using RNA-sequencing. Finally, we evaluated neutrophil protein translation, mitochondrial function and metabolism, reactive oxygen species content, and neutrophil extracellular traps generation. Results: We detected 2 temporarily distinct waves of neutrophils during (1) necroinflammation (at 24 hours after injury) and (2) late repair (at 72 hours). Early neutrophils were proinflammatory, characterized by: (1) upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, (2) activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway, (3) reduction of protein translation, (4) decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and (5) higher propensity to generate reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps. In contrast, late neutrophils were prorepair and enriched in genes and pathways associated with tissue repair and angiogenesis. Finally, early proinflammatory neutrophils were characterized by the expression of a short isoform of C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, while the late prorepair neutrophils were characterized by the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4. Conclusions: This study underscores the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils and their dual role in inflammation and tissue repair during ALI.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem leading to permanently disfiguring skin lesions caused by Leishmania parasites. Lesion severity stems from an excessive host inflammatory response that prevents healing. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and translational responses of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during murine CL using historical single-cell RNA sequencing data combined with flow cytometry and in vivo puromycin incorporation to assess translational activity. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation pathways including MHC-I, MHC-II, and immunoproteasome transcripts in dermal LECs from Leishmania major-infected mice compared to naive controls. LECs also exhibited increased expression of guanylate binding proteins and interferon-inducible genes, indicative of immune activation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that LECs in leishmanial lesions displayed heightened translational activity relative to LECs from uninflamed ears, and LEC translational activity was highest in activated LECs. Furthermore, LEC translational activity exceeded that of other cell types within the lesion microenvironment. Validating the transcriptomic data, LECs in lesions expressed elevated MHC-II and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), supporting their potential role in antigen presentation. Functional assays using DQ-OVA confirmed that LECs from leishmanial lesions efficiently uptake and process antigens, highlighting their capability as antigen presenting cells in the inflamed dermal microenvironment. Overall, our study reveals the activation status of LECs in leishmanial lesions, shedding light on their potential role in shaping local immunity and inflammation in a variety of skin diseases.">

        <tr id="Viral infection leads to heterogeneous cellular outcomes ranging from refractory to abortive and fully productive states. Single cell transcriptomics enables a high resolution view of these distinct post-infection states. Here, we have interrogated the host-pathogen dynamics following reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). While benign in most people, EBV is responsible for infectious mononucleosis, up to 2% of human cancers, and is a trigger for the development of multiple sclerosis. Following latency establishment in B cells, EBV reactivates and is shed in saliva to enable infection of new hosts. Beyond its importance for transmission, the lytic cycle is also implicated in EBV-associated oncogenesis. Conversely, induction of lytic reactivation in latent EBV-positive tumors presents a novel therapeutic opportunity. Therefore, defining the dynamics and heterogeneity of EBV lytic reactivation is a high priority to better understand pathogenesis and therapeutic potential. In this study, we applied single-cell techniques to analyze diverse fate trajectories during lytic reactivation in two B cell models. Consistent with prior work, we find that cell cycle and MYC expression correlate with cells refractory to lytic reactivation. We further found that lytic induction yields a continuum from abortive to complete reactivation. Abortive lytic cells upregulate NFκB and IRF3 pathway target genes, while cells that proceed through the full lytic cycle exhibit unexpected expression of genes associated with cellular reprogramming. Distinct subpopulations of lytic cells further displayed variable profiles for transcripts known to escape virus-mediated host shutoff. These data reveal previously unknown and promiscuous outcomes of lytic reactivation with broad implications for viral replication and EBV-associated oncogenesis. AUTHOR SUMMARY / SIGNIFICANCE Viral infections profoundly alter host cell biological programming in ways that potentiate disease. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a particularly prevalent human pathogen associated with diverse cancers and several autoimmune disorders. EBV predominantly establishes latent infection in B cells and can promote B cell malignancies through functions of well-characterized latent oncoproteins. Aspects of the viral lytic cycle also clearly contribute to EBV-associated diseases, although pathologic roles of lytic reactivation are incompletely understood. Here we use single-cell techniques to examine cellular responses to EBV lytic reactivation in multiple B cell models. Consistent with prior studies, reactivation from latency is incomplete (abortive) in some cells and successful in others. Abortive and full lytic trajectories exhibit distinct biological responses that each may promote pathogenesis and reinforce bimodal latent-lytic control. Intriguingly, a portion on cells that proceed through the lytic cycle exhibits unexpected and striking expression of genes associated with cellular reprogramming, pluripotency, and self-renewal. Collectively, this study provides a valuable resource to understand diverse host-virus dynamics and fates during viral reactivation and identifies multiple modes of EBV lytic pathogenesis to investigate in future research.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

        <tr id="Schistosomiasis is an infection caused by contact with Schistosoma-contaminated water and affects more than 230 million people worldwide with varying morbidity. The roles of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and regulatory immune responses in chronic infection are well documented, but less is known about human immune responses during acute infection. Here, we comprehensively map immune responses during controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infection using male or female cercariae. Immune responses to male or female parasite single-sex infection were comparable. An early TH1-biased inflammatory response was observed at week 4 after infection, which was particularly apparent in individuals experiencing symptoms of acute schistosomiasis. By week 8 after infection, inflammatory responses were followed by an expansion of TH2 and regulatory cell subsets. This study demonstrates the shift from TH1 to both TH2 and regulatory responses, typical of chronic schistosomiasis, in the absence of egg production and provides immunological insight into the clinical manifestations of acute schistosomiasis. Single-sex (egg-free) Schistosoma mansoni infection induces initial type 1 responses in symptomatic participants that mature to type 2. Editor’s summary Schistosomiasis infection causes more than 230 million infections worldwide, but immune responses during acute infection are not well understood. To better observe these responses, Houlder et al. used controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infections with either male or female cercaria-stage parasites. T helper 1 (TH1) cell–biased inflammatory responses dominated at early time points (4 weeks after infection), and male and female parasites induced similar responses. At 8 weeks after infection, TH2 and regulatory cell responses were more dominant and were consistent with responses seen during chronic infection. These results highlight the shift in immune responses occurring over the course of infection. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Neutrophils, underestimated in multiple sclerosis (MS), are gaining increased attention for their significant functions in patients with MS and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. However, the precise role of neutrophils in cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), the primary CNS-draining lymph nodes where the autoimmune response is initiated during the progression of EAE, remains poorly understood. Methods Applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we constructed a comprehensive immune cell atlas of CLNs during development of EAE. Through this atlas, we concentrated on and uncovered the transcriptional landscape, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils, and their crosstalk with immune cells within CLNs in the neuroinflammatory processes in EAE. Results Notably, we observed a substantial increase in the neutrophil population in EAE mice, with a particular emphasis on the significant rise within the CLNs. Neutrophils in CLNs were categorized into 3 subtypes, and we explored the specific roles and developmental trajectories of each distinct neutrophil subtype. Neutrophils were found to engage in extensive interactions with other immune cells, playing crucial roles in T-cell activation. Moreover, our findings highlighted the strong migratory ability of neutrophils to CLNs, partly regulated by triggering the receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1). Inhibiting TREM1 with LR12 prevents neutrophil migration both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, in patients with MS, we confirmed an increase in peripheral neutrophils with an upregulation of TREM-1. Discussion Our research provides a comprehensive and precise single-cell atlas of CLNs in EAE, highlighting the role of neutrophils in regulating the periphery immune response. In addition, TREM-1 emerged as an essential regulator of neutrophil migration to CLNs, holding promise as a potential therapeutic target in MS.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced cell death is a key contributor to COVID-19 pathology. Cell death induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well studied in myeloid cells but less in its primary host cell type, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing human airway epithelia (HAE). SARS-CoV-2 induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in HAE organotypic cultures. Single-cell and limiting-dilution analysis revealed that necroptosis is the primary cell death event in infected cells, whereas uninfected bystanders undergo apoptosis, and pyroptosis occurs later during infection. Mechanistically, necroptosis is induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA–binding protein 1 (ZBP1) in HAE and lung tissues from patients with COVID-19. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, which causes more severe disease than Omicron (B1.1.529) in humans, is associated with orders of magnitude–greater Z-RNA/ZBP1 interactions, necroptosis, and disease severity in animal models. Thus, Delta induces robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis and more disease severity. Z-RNA/ZBP1–induced necroptosis is an initiating cell death event that occurs markedly more with Delta than Omicron infection. Editor’s summary SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers multiple cell death pathways that contribute to disease severity. Here, Liang et al. characterized cell death mechanisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing cells and primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in autopsied lungs from patients with COVID-19. Necroptosis was the primary form of cell death and was induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP-1). Infected and bystander cells underwent apoptosis, but limiting dilution analysis showed that apoptosis was a bystander effect. The Delta variant induced much greater Z-RNA/ZBP-1 interactions and necroptosis compared with Omicron, thus suggesting a mechanism associated with greater disease severity (see related Focus by Wong and Perlman). —Christiana N.

        <tr id="The mechanisms of postacute medical conditions and unexplained symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection [Long Covid (LC)] are incompletely understood. There is growing evidence that viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and T cell dysfunction may play major roles. We performed whole-body positron emission tomography imaging in a well-characterized cohort of 24 participants at time points ranging from 27 to 910 days after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using the radiopharmaceutical agent [18F]F-AraG, a selective tracer that allows for anatomical quantitation of activated T lymphocytes. Tracer uptake in the postacute COVID-19 group, which included those with and without continuing symptoms, was higher compared with prepandemic controls in many regions, including the brain stem, spinal cord, bone marrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and gut wall. T cell activation in the spinal cord and gut wall was associated with the presence of LC symptoms. In addition, tracer uptake in lung tissue was higher in those with persistent pulmonary symptoms specifically. Increased T cell activation in these tissues was also observed in many individuals without LC. Given the high [18F]F-AraG uptake detected in the gut, we obtained colorectal tissue for in situ hybridization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immunohistochemical studies in a subset of five participants with LC symptoms. We identified intracellular SARS-CoV-2 single-stranded spike protein–encoding RNA in rectosigmoid lamina propria tissue in all five participants and double-stranded spike protein–encoding RNA in three participants up to 676 days after initial COVID-19, suggesting that tissue viral persistence could be associated with long-term immunologic perturbations. Total-body PET imaging and microscopy analysis of rectosigmoid biopsies reveal prolonged T cell activation and SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence following COVID-19. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a diverse array of symptoms that an individual might experience weeks to years after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Many drivers of Long Covid have been proposed, with supporting data for each. Here, Peluso et al. provide compelling evidence for two potential contributors: persistent SARS-CoV-2 and aberrant T cell activation. The authors used whole-body positron emission tomography imaging with a tracer that selectively tags activated T cells to show that those with Long Covid had certain tissues that were enriched for activated T cells in comparison with those without Long Covid. Moreover, because the gut was one of the sites of activated T cell enrichment, the authors analyzed gut biopsies from a subset of individuals with Long Covid. In these samples, the authors were able to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; this feature was consistent across all five samples analyzed. These data suggest that viral persistence and sustained immune activation are linked to Long Covid. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The human polyomavirus, JCPyV, establishes a lifelong persistent infection in the peripheral organs of a majority of the human population worldwide. Patients who are immunocompromised due to underlying infections, cancer, or to immunomodulatory treatments for autoimmune disease are at risk for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) when the virus invades the CNS and infects macroglial cells in the brain parenchyma. It is not yet known how the virus enters the CNS to cause disease. The blood-choroid plexus barrier is a potential site of virus invasion as the cells that make up this barrier are known to be infected with virus both in vivo and in vitro. To understand the effects of virus infection on these cells we challenged primary human choroid plexus epithelial cells with JCPyV and profiled changes in host gene expression. We found that viral infection induced the expression of proinflammatory chemokines and downregulated junctional proteins essential for maintaining blood-CSF and blood-brain barrier function. These data contribute to our understanding of how JCPyV infection of the choroid plexus can modulate the host cell response to neuroinvasive pathogens. IMPORTANCE The human polyomavirus, JCPyV, causes a rapidly progressing demyelinating disease in the CNS of patients whose immune systems are compromised. JCPyV infection has been demonstrated in the choroid plexus both in vivo and in vitro and this highly vascularized organ may be important in viral invasion of brain parenchyma. Our data show that infection of primary choroid plexus epithelial cells results in increased expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and downregulation of critical junctional proteins that maintain the blood-CSF barrier. These data have direct implications for mechanisms used by JCPyV to invade the CNS and cause neurological disease.

        <tr id="The establishment of memory T cell responses is critical to protection against pathogens and is influenced by the conditions under which memory formation occurs. Iron is an essential micronutrient for multiple immunologic processes and nutritional deficiency is a common problem worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the establishment of memory T cell responses is not fully understood. In this study we investigate the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the generation, phenotype, and function of memory T cell responses using a murine model of dietary iron modulation in the context of influenza infection. Iron deficient mice have decreased systemic iron levels and develop significant anemia. Increased T cell expression of the transferrin receptor (CD71) is seen in iron deficient mice at baseline. During primary influenza infection, iron deficient mice experience increased weight loss and phenotypic evidence of impairments in T cell activation. Following recovery from infection, iron deficient mice generate increased influenza specific memory T cells which exhibit impaired ability to produce IFNγ, most notably within the lung. Importantly, the ability to produce IFNγ and TNFα is not recovered by co-culture with iron replete dendritic cells, suggesting a T cell intrinsic alteration in functional memory formation. Altogether, these results isolate a critical effect of nutritional iron deficiency on T cell memory development and function.">

        <tr id="The telomerase RNA component (Terc) constitutes a non-coding RNA critical for telomerase function, commonly associated with aging and pivotal in immunomodulation during inflammation. Our study unveils heightened susceptibility to pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in Terc knockout (Tercko/ko) mice compared to both young and old infected counterparts. The exacerbated infection in Tercko/ko mice correlates with heightened inflammation, manifested by elevated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels and activation of the NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome within the lung. Employing mRNA sequencing methods alongside in vitro analysis of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and T cells, our study elucidates a compelling correlation between Tercko/ko, inflammation, and impaired T cell functionality. Terc deletion results in compromised T cell function, characterized by dysregulation of the T cell receptor and absence of CD247, potentially compromising the host’s capacity to mount an effective immune response against S. aureus. This investigation provides insights into the intricate mechanisms governing increased vulnerability to severe pneumonia in the context of Terc deficiency, which might also contribute to aging-related pathologies, while also revealing for the first time the influence of Terc on T cell function.

        <tr id="Muscle fatigue represents the most prevalent symptom of long-term COVID, with elusive pathogenic mechanisms. We performed a longitudinal study to characterize histopathological and transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in a hamster model of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them with influenza A virus (IAV) and mock infections. Histopathological and bulk RNA sequencing analyses of leg muscles derived from infected animals at days 3, 30, and 60 post-infection showed no direct viral invasion but myofiber atrophy in the SARS-CoV-2 group, which was accompanied by persistent downregulation of the genes related to myofibers, ribosomal proteins, fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes. While both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections induced acute and transient type I and II interferon responses in muscle, only the SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated TNF-α/NF-κB but not IL-6 signaling in muscle. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes, a skeletal muscle cell line, with combined IFN-γ and TNF-α but not with IFN-γ or TNF-α alone markedly impaired mitochondrial function. We conclude that a respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause myofiber atrophy and persistent energy metabolism suppression without direct viral invasion. The effects may be induced by the combined systemic interferon and TNF-α responses at the acute phase and may contribute to post-COVID-19 persistent muscle fatigue.">

        <tr id="Developing vaccines that promote CD8+ T cell memory is a challenge for infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy. TCF-1+ stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells are important determinants of long-lived memory. Yet, the developmental requirements for TSCM formation are unclear. Here, we identify the temporal window for type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR) blockade to drive TSCM cell generation. TSCM cells were transcriptionally distinct and emerged from a transitional precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular state concomitant with viral clearance. TSCM differentiation correlated with T cell retention within the lymph node paracortex, due to increased CXCR3 chemokine abundance which disrupted gradient formation. These affects were due a counterintuitive increase in IFNψ, which controlled cell location. Combining IFNAR inhibition with mRNA-LNP vaccination promoted specific TSCM differentiation and enhanced protection against chronic infection. These finding propose a new approach to vaccine design whereby modulation of inflammation promotes memory formation and function. HIGHLIGHTS Early, transient inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNAR) during acute viral infection promotes stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cell differentiation without establishing chronic infection. TSCM and precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular states are distinguished transcriptionally and by cell surface markers. Developmentally, TSCM cell differentiation occurs via a transition from a TPEX state coinciding with viral clearance. Transient IFNAR blockade increases IFNψ production to modulate the ligands of CXCR3 and couple TSCM differentiation to cell retention within the T cell paracortex of the lymph node. Specific promotion of TSCM cell differentiation with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccination elicits enhanced protection against chronic viral challenge.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of complex interactions between cellular and extracellular components, among which the immune system is known to play an integral role in disease progression and response to therapy. Cytokines and chemokines are cell signaling proteins used by immune cells to communicate with each other as well as with other cell types in the body. These proteins control systemic and local immune responses and levels of cytokines/chemokines in the TME have been associated with tumor outcomes. However, cytokines and chemokines have varied expression across cell types, tumors, and host conditions. Therefore, approaches to effectively study the production of these proteins at the single-cell level in the TME are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing the anti-cancer immune response. Here, we detail a protocol to assess the production of cytokines/chemokines across leukocyte populations in mouse tumors using RNA flow cytometry. Importantly, this method can be adapted with minimal changes to study various mouse and human tumors, other RNA analytes, and non-tumor tissues. With this approach, we characterize single-cell production of Ifnb1, Xcl1 and Ccl5 in mouse tumors and identify monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages as the main producers of type I interferon transcript Ifnb1 consistent across 4 different syngeneic tumor models.">

        <tr id="Background In some patients, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea occur as part of long COVID-19 syndrome following acute respiratory symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, the characteristics of immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract of COVID-19 patients and their association with these symptoms remain unclear. Methodology Data were collected from 95 COVID-19 patients. Among this cohort, 11 patients who exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms and underwent gastroscopy were selected. Using imaging mass cytometry, the gastrointestinal tissues of these patients were thoroughly analyzed to identify immune cell subgroups and investigate their spatial distribution. Results Significant acute inflammatory responses were found in the gastrointestinal tissues, particularly in the duodenum, of COVID-19 patients. These alterations included an increase in the levels of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+CD4+ T-cells, which was more pronounced in tissues with nucleocapsid protein (NP). The amount of CD68+ macrophages positively correlates with the number of CD3+CD4+ T-cells (R = 0.783, p < 0.001), additionally, spatial neighborhood analysis uncovered decreased interactions between CD68+ macrophages and multiple immune cells were noted in NP-positive tissues. Furthermore, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was employed to extract gene signatures related to clinical features and immune responses from the RNA-seq data derived from gastrointestinal tissues from COVID-19 patients, and we validated that the MEgreen module shown positive correlation with clinical parameter (i.e., Total bilirubin, ALT, AST) and macrophages (R = 0.84, p = 0.001), but negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells (R = −0.62, p = 0.004). By contrast, the MEblue module was inversely associated with macrophages and positively related with CD4+ T cells. Gene function enrichment analyses revealed that the MEgreen module is closely associated with biological processes such as immune response activation, signal transduction, and chemotaxis regulation, indicating its role in the gastrointestinal inflammatory response. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the role of specific immune cell groups in the gastrointestinal inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. Gene coexpression network analysis further emphasized the importance of the gene modules in gastrointestinal immune responses, providing potential molecular targets for the treatment of COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms.">

In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 36 individuals (18 RA patients and 18 matched controls, accounting for age, sex, race, and ethnicity), to identify disease-relevant cell subsets and cell type-specific signatures associated with disease activity. Our analysis revealed 18 distinct PBMC subsets, including an IFITM3 overexpressing Interferon-activated (IFN-activated) monocyte subset. We observed an increase in CD4+ T effector memory cells in patients with moderate to high disease activity (DAS28-CRP ≥ 3.2), and a decrease in non-classical monocytes in patients with low disease activity or remission (DAS28-CRP < 3.2). Pseudobulk analysis by cell type identified 168 differentially expressed genes between RA and matched controls, with a downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes in the gamma-delta T cells subset, alteration of genes associated with RA predisposition in the IFN-activated subset, and non-classical monocytes. Additionally, we identified a gene signature associated with moderate-high disease activity, characterized by upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as TNF, JUN, EGR1, IFIT2, MAFB, G0S2, and downregulation of genes including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, TNFSF13B. Notably, cell-cell communication analysis revealed an upregulation of signaling pathways, including VISTA, in both moderate-high and remission-low disease activity contexts.

        <tr id="Venous thromboembolism is common in individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases, but the pathogenic basis for this increased thrombotic risk remains poorly understood. Myeloid cell ‘trained immunity’ describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a novel maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages trained previously with either β-glucan or free haem exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant and antifibrinolytic gene expression and activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. The β-glucan training-mediated increase in activated myeloid cell procoagulant activity was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase-mediated tissue factor (TF) functional decryption. Furthermore, pre-treatment with methyltransferase and acetyltransferase inhibitors to erase epigenetic marks associated with innate immune memory diminished trained macrophage TF gene expression in β-glucan-trained macrophages. Functional analysis of splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan-trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Remarkably, monocyte procoagulant activity increased proportionately with time since β-glucan administration, before plateauing at 4 weeks. Furthermore, haematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid isolated from β-glucan-trained mice possessed enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in immunothrombotic disease development, opening new avenues for targeted intervention.">

Previous investigations from our research group have revealed an antimicrobial gene expression profile within murine bone marrow erythroid cells which suggested a role for erythroid cells in innate immunity. In the present study, we focused on elucidating the characteristics of human bone marrow erythroid cells through comprehensive analyses, including NanoString gene expression profiling utilizing the Immune Response V2 panel, a BioPlex examination of chemokine and TGF-beta family proteins secretion, and analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data. Our findings demonstrate that an erythroid cell subpopulation manifests a myeloid-like gene expression signature comprised of antibacterial immunity and neutrophil chemotaxis genes which suggests an involvement of human erythroid cells in the innate immunity. Furthermore, we found that human erythroid cells secreted CCL22, CCL24, CXCL5, CXCL8, and MIF chemokines. The ability of human erythroid cells to express these chemokines might facilitate the restriction of immune cells in the bone marrow under normal conditions or contribute to the ability of erythroid cells to induce local immunosuppression by recruiting immune cells in their immediate vicinity in case of extramedullary hematopoiesis.">

Immune cells are reported to upregulate CD47 during infection, however, the role of CD47 in innate and adaptive immune cells remains unclear.


METHODS
To bridge this knowledge gap, we analysed our single cell (sc)-RNA dataset along with other publicly available sc-RNA datasets from healthy controls, people with HIV-1 (PWH) and COVID-19 patients. We characterized each immune cell based on low, intermediate, and high expression of CD47 .


RESULTS
Our analyses revealed that CD47 high pDCs and monocytes exhibited relatively higher expression of IFN-α regulatory genes, antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and MHC-I associated genes compared to CD47 inter. and CD47 low cells. Furthermore, CD47 high NK and CD8+ T cells showed higher expression of antiviral ISGs, as well as genes encoding for cytotoxic markers like granzyme B, perforin, granulysin, interferon gamma and NKG7. Additionally, CD47 high CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of PD-1 and LAG-3 genes. Lastly, we found that CD47 high B cells had enriched expression of genes involved in cell activation and humoral responses.


CONCLUSION
Overall, our analyses revealed that innate and adaptive immune cells expressing elevated activation and functional gene signatures also express higher CD47 levels.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immunotherapies targeting T cells in solid cancers are revolutionizing clinical treatment. Novel immunotherapies have had extremely limited benefit for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we characterized the immune microenvironment of t(8;21) AML patients to determine how immune cell infiltration status influenced prognosis. Methods Through multi-omics studies of primary and longitudinal t(8;21) AML samples, we characterized the heterogeneous immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and their immune checkpoint gene expression. Further external cohorts were also included in this research. Results CD8+ T cells were enriched and HAVCR2 and TIGIT were upregulated in the CD34+CD117dim%-High group; these features are known to be associated with immune exhaustion. Data integration analysis of single-cell dynamics revealed that a subset of T cells (cluster_2) (highly expressing GZMB, NKG7, PRF1 and GNLY) evolved and expanded markedly in the drug-resistant stage after relapse. External cohort analysis confirmed that the cluster_2 T-cell signature could be utilized to stratify patients by overall survival outcome. Discussion In conclusion, we discovered a distinct T-cell signature by scRNA-seq that was correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Our research provides a novel system for classifying patients based on their immune microenvironment.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic and contributes to long-lasting morbidity. Several studies have investigated immediate cellular and humoral immune responses during acute infection. However, little is known about long-term effects of COVID-19 on the immune system.


METHODS
We performed a longitudinal investigation of cellular and humoral immune parameters in 106 non-vaccinated subjects ten weeks (10 w) and ten months (10 m) after their first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Peripheral blood immune cells were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry, serum cytokines were examined by multiplex technology. Antibodies specific for the Spike protein (S), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the nucleocapsid protein (NC) were determined. All parameters measured 10 w and 10 m after infection were compared with those of a matched, noninfected control group (n = 98).


RESULTS
Whole blood flow cytometric analyses revealed that 10 m after COVID-19, convalescent patients compared to controls had reduced absolute granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, involving T, B, and NK cells, in particular CD3+CD45RA+CD62L+CD31+ recent thymic emigrant T cells and non-class-switched CD19+IgD+CD27+ memory B cells. Cellular changes were associated with a reversal from Th1- to Th2-dominated serum cytokine patterns. Strong declines of NC- and S-specific antibody levels were associated with younger age (by 10.3 years, p < .01) and fewer CD3-CD56+ NK and CD19+CD27+ B memory cells. Changes of T-cell subsets at 10 m such as normalization of effector and Treg numbers, decline of RTE, and increase of central memory T cell numbers were independent of antibody decline pattern.


CONCLUSIONS
COVID-19 causes long-term reduction of innate and adaptive immune cells which is associated with a Th2 serum cytokine profile. This may provide an immunological mechanism for long-term sequelae after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Due to the historical dogma, that host defense against intracellular pathogens is mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response. Here we addressed the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10) secreting B cells in long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Our research highlights the previously unknown role of B cell-derived IL-10 as a negative regulator of protective immunity in TB. For the first time, we demonstrate that mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 show increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, as evidenced by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was accompanied by male-specific immune alterations, indicating a previously unknown sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key effectors in co-ordinating inflammatory and immune responses to threats to the host. How macrophages decipher diverse danger signals to tailor inflammatory responses remains an unanswered question. Cell volume control is critical for normal cellular function. Disturbances in extracellular and intracellular homeostasis induce changes in cell volume, but the impact of disruptions in cell volume in controlling macrophage inflammatory responses is poorly understood. Here, we discover that macrophages use cell volume control as a bona fide danger sensing mechanism to promote and augment inflammatory responses. Using macrophages deficient in the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), which lack cell volume control under hypo-osmotic conditions, we show that disruptions in cell volume are sensed by macrophages to drive a large transcriptomic response and induction of inflammation. Cell volume disruption, particularly loss of cell volume control, induces type I interferon signalling through a DNA– and STING-dependent mechanism, but independent of cGAS and 2’3’cGAMP transport. Further, we found that cell volume changes synergise with diverse pathogen-mediated signalling to augment type I interferon responses and exacerbate the cytokine storm in a mouse model of hyperinflammation. Our findings highlight cell volume as an important regulator in shaping inflammatory responses, adding to our understanding of how macrophages sense complex danger signals and threats.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance. Here we report that p16High immune cells play a key role in establishing disease tolerance. We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan.

        <tr id="The effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain rapidly wanes over time. Growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that influenza vaccination is associated with a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate the cross-reactive immune responses of influenza vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides based on in vitro study. Our data indicate enhanced activation-induced-marker (AIM) expression on CD4+ T cells in influenza-vaccination (IV)-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon stimulation with spike-protein-peptide pools. The fractions of other immune cell subtypes, including CD8+ T cells, monocytes, NK cells, and antigen-presenting cells, were not changed between IV-treated and control PBMCs following ex vivo spike-protein-peptide stimulation. However, the classical antiviral (IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1RA) cytokine responses to spike-protein-peptide stimulation were still enhanced in PBMCs from both IV-immunized adult and aged mice. Decreased expression of proinflammatory IL-1β, IL-12p40, and TNF-α is associated with inhibited levels of histone acetylation in PBMCs from IV-treated mice. Remarkably, prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2 does not result in modification of histone acetylation or hemagglutinin-protein-induced cytokine responses. This response is antibody-independent but can be mediated by manipulating the histone acetylation of PBMCs. These data experimentally support that influenza vaccination could induce modification of histone acetylation in immune cells and reveal the existence of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which may provide insights for the adjuvant of influenza vaccine to limit COVID-19-related inflammatory responses.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial and complex role in balancing the immune response to viral infection. Primarily, they serve to regulate the immune response by limiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, reducing inflammation in infected tissue, and limiting virus-specific T cell responses. But excessive activity of Tregs can also be detrimental and hinder the ability to effectively clear viral infection, leading to prolonged disease and potential worsening of disease severity. Not much is known about the impact of Tregs during severe influenza. In the present study, we show that CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs are strongly involved in disease progression during influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice. By comparing sublethal with lethal dose infection in vivo, we found that not the viral load but an increased number of CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs may impair the immune response by suppressing virus specific CD8+ T cells and favors disease progression. Moreover, the transfer of induced Tregs into mice with mild disease symptoms had a negative and prolonged effect on disease outcome, emphasizing their importance for pathogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with MEK-inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction of induced Tregs in vitro and in vivo and positively influenced the progression of the disease. Our results demonstrate that CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs are involved in the pathogenesis of severe influenza and indicate the potential of the MEK-inhibitor zapnometinib to modulate CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. Thus, making MEK-inhibitors even more promising for the treatment of severe influenza virus infections.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells and involves an interplay between β cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in β cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and PD-1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets from inhibitor-treated mice revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways. RNA sequencing of polarized proinflammatory macrophages showed that VLX-1005 significantly reduced the interferon response. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.">

        <tr id="The production and sensing of type I interferons (IFN-I) are critical for antiviral defense, yet most virus-infected cells do not produce IFN-I or upregulate IFN-stimulated genes. Using quantitative proteomics and global protein synthesis measurements, we show that productive viral infection globally down-regulates protein synthesis, restricting the IFN response. Guard immunity, which responds to disruptions in essential cellular processes, might compensate for the lack of IFN-I response by rapidly killing infected cells. However, non-pathological stressors can also disrupt proteostasis, making it unclear how cells decide to trigger guard immunity. We hypothesized that TNFα, produced by macrophages, provides a contextual signal allowing specificity. Using live-cell fluorescence microscopy and mathematical modeling, we showed that TNFα synergizes with the rapid decay of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP to induce cell death and prevent viral spread. Our findings demonstrate that TNFα contextualizes proteostasis loss as non-sterile, enabling the activation of guard immunity to counteract viral infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has been a major public health burden. We hypothesised that circulating extracellular vesicles (cEVs), key players in health and disease, could trace the cell changes during COVID‐19 infection and recovery. Therefore, we studied the temporal trend of cEV and inflammatory marker levels in plasma samples of COVID‐19 patients that were collected within 24 h of patient admission (baseline, n = 80) and after hospital discharge at day‐90 post‐admission (n = 59). Inflammatory markers were measured by standard biochemical methods. cEVs were quantitatively and phenotypically characterized by high‐sensitivity nano flow cytometry. In patients recovered from COVID‐19 lower levels of inflammatory markers were detected. cEVs from vascular (endothelial cells) and blood (platelets, distinct immune subsets) cells were significantly reduced at day‐90 compared to admission levels, a pattern also observed for cEVs from progenitor, perivascular and epithelial cells. The best discriminatory power for COVID‐19 severity was found for inflammatory markers lactate dehydrogenase and neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio and for granulocyte/macrophage‐released CD66b+/CD68+‐cEVs. Albeit inflammatory markers were good indicators of systemic inflammatory response and discriminators of COVID‐19 remission, they do not completely reveal cell stress and organ damage states. cEVs reaching baseline pre‐infection levels at 90 days post‐infection in recovered patients discriminate parental cells affected by disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective Unique metabolic requirements accompany the development and functional fates of immune cells. How cellular metabolism is important in natural killer (NK) cells and their memory‐like differentiation in bacterial infections remains elusive. Methods Here, we utilise our established NK cell memory assay to investigate the metabolic requirement for memory‐like NK cell formation and function in response to the Gram‐negative intracellular bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP), the causative agent of melioidosis. Results We demonstrate that CD160+ memory‐like NK cells upon BP stimulation upregulate glucose and amino acid transporters in a cohort of recovered melioidosis patients which is maintained at least 3‐month post‐hospital admission. Using an in vitro assay, human BP‐specific CD160+ memory‐like NK cells show metabolic priming including increased expression of glucose and amino acid transporters with elevated glucose uptake, increased mTOR activation and mitochondrial membrane potential upon BP re‐stimulation. Antigen‐specific and cytokine‐induced IFN‐γ production of this memory‐like NK cell subset are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with some dependency on glycolysis, whereas the formation of CD160+ memory‐like NK cells in vitro is dependent on fatty acid oxidation and OXPHOS and further increased by metformin. Conclusion This study reveals the link between metabolism and cellular function of memory‐like NK cells, which can be exploited for vaccine design and for monitoring protection against Gram‐negative bacterial infection.">

        <tr id="Durable serological memory following vaccination is critically dependent on the production and survival of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). Yet, the factors that control LLPC specification and survival remain poorly resolved. Using intravital two-photon imaging, we find that in contrast to most plasma cells (PCs) in the bone marrow (BM), LLPCs are uniquely sessile and organized into clusters that are dependent on APRIL, an important survival factor. Using deep, bulk RNA sequencing, and surface protein flow-based phenotyping, we find that LLPCs express a unique transcriptome and phenotype compared to bulk PCs, fine-tuning expression of key cell surface molecules, CD93, CD81, CXCR4, CD326, CD44, and CD48, important for adhesion and homing. Conditional deletion of Cxcr4 in PCs following immunization leads to rapid mobilization from the BM, reduced survival of antigen-specific PCs, and ultimately accelerated decay of antibody titer. In naïve mice, the endogenous LLPCs BCR repertoire exhibits reduced diversity, reduced somatic mutations, and increased public clones and IgM isotypes, particularly in young mice, suggesting LLPC specification is non-random. As mice age, the BM PC compartment becomes enriched in LLPCs, which may outcompete and limit entry of new PCs into the LLPC niche and pool.">

        <tr id="STING agonists can reprogram the tumor microenvironment to induce immunological clearance within the central nervous system. Using multiplexed sequential immunofluorescence (SeqIF) and the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas, STING expression was found in myeloid populations and in the perivascular space. The STING agonist 8803 increased median survival in multiple preclinical models of glioblastoma, including QPP8, an immune checkpoint blockade–resistant model, where 100% of mice were cured. Ex vivo flow cytometry profiling during the therapeutic window demonstrated increases in myeloid tumor trafficking and activation, alongside enhancement of CD8+ T cell and NK effector responses. Treatment with 8803 reprogrammed microglia to express costimulatory CD80/CD86 and iNOS, while decreasing immunosuppressive CD206 and arginase. In humanized mice, where tumor cell STING is epigenetically silenced, 8803 therapeutic activity was maintained, further attesting to myeloid dependency and reprogramming. Although the combination with a STAT3 inhibitor did not further enhance STING agonist activity, the addition of anti–PD-1 antibodies to 8803 treatment enhanced survival in an immune checkpoint blockade–responsive glioma model. In summary, 8803 as a monotherapy demonstrates marked in vivo therapeutic activity, meriting consideration for clinical translation.">

        <tr id="Introduction Neutrophils play a complex and important role in the immunopathology of TB. Data suggest they are protective during early infection but become a main driver of immunopathology if infection progresses to active disease. Neutrophils are now recognized to exist in functionally diverse states, but little work has been done on how neutrophil states or subsets are skewed in TB disease. Methods To address this, we carried out comprehensive phenotyping by flow cytometry of neutrophils in the blood and airways of individuals with active pulmonary TB with and without HIV co-infection recruited in Durban, South Africa. Results Active TB was associated with a profound skewing of neutrophils in the blood toward phenotypes associated with activation and apoptosis, reduced phagocytosis, reverse transmigration, and immune regulation. This skewing was also apparently in airway neutrophils, particularly the regulatory subsets expressing PDL-1 and LOX-1. HIV co-infection did not impact neutrophil subsets in the blood but was associated with a phenotypic change in the airways and a reduction in key neutrophil functional proteins cathelicidin and arginase 1. Discussion Active TB is associated with profound skewing of blood and airway neutrophils and suggests multiple mechanisms by which neutrophils may exacerbate the immunopathology of TB. These data indicate potential avenues for reducing neutrophil-mediated lung pathology at the point of diagnosis.">

        <tr id="Background The involvement of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CTLs) and their potential role in dictating the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) remains an unexplored area of research. Methods Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed the immunophenotype and expression patterns of CD4+ T lymphocyte subtypes in mRCC patients, followed by preliminary validation via multi-immunofluorescent staining. In addition, we obtained a comprehensive immunotherapy dataset encompassing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and bulk RNA-seq cohorts from the European Genome-Phenome Archive and ArrayExpress database. Utilizing the CIBERSORTx deconvolution algorithms, we derived a signature score for CD4+ CTLs from the bulk-RNA-seq datasets of the CheckMate 009/025 clinical trials. Results Single-cell analysis of CD4+ T lymphocytes in mRCC reveals several cancer-specific states, including diverse phenotypes of regulatory T cells. Remarkably, we observe that CD4+ CTLs cells constitute a substantial proportion of all CD4+ T lymphocyte sub-clusters in mRCC patients, highlighting their potential significance in the disease. Furthermore, within mRCC patients, we identify two distinct cytotoxic states of CD4+ T cells: CD4+GZMK+ T cells, which exhibit a weaker cytotoxic potential, and CD4+GZMB+ T cells, which demonstrate robust cytotoxic activity. Both regulatory T cells and CD4+ CTLs originate from proliferating CD4+ T cells within mRCC tissues. Intriguingly, our trajectory analysis indicates that the weakly cytotoxic CD4+GZMK+ T cells differentiate from their more cytotoxic CD4+GZMB+ counterparts. In comparing patients with lower CD4+ CTLs levels to those with higher CD4+ CTLs abundance in the CheckMate 009 and 25 immunotherapy cohorts, the latter group exhibited significantly improved OS and PFS probability. Conclusion Our study underscores the pivotal role that intratumoral CD4+ CTLs may play in bolstering anti-tumor immunity, suggesting their potential as a promising biomarker for predicting response to ICIs in patients with mRCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract CD19‐targeted chimeric antigen receptor T‐cell (CAR‐T) immunotherapy has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory large B‐cell lymphoma (LBCL), yet durable remissions are observed in less than half of treated patients. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key and understudied factor impacting CD19 CAR‐T therapy outcomes. Using NanoString nCounter transcriptome profiling (n = 24) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC, n = 15), we studied the TME in pretreatment biopsies from patients with LBCL undergoing CD19 CAR‐T therapy. Patients who achieved complete response (CR) after CAR‐T therapy demonstrated higher expression of genes associated with T‐cell trafficking and function, whereas those who did not achieve CR had higher expression of genes associated with macrophages and T‐cell dysfunction. Distinct patterns of immune infiltration and fibrosis in the TME were associated with CAR‐T therapy outcomes, and these findings were corroborated using artificial intelligence‐assisted image analyses. Patients who achieved CR had a lower proportion of the biopsy occupied by an interspersed immune infiltrate and a higher proportion of hypocellular/fibrotic regions. Furthermore, mIHC revealed lower density of CD4+ T cells and higher densities of both macrophages and tumor cells expressing PD‐L1 in non‐CR patients. Spatial analysis revealed that PD‐1+ T cells were in close proximity to PD‐L1+ macrophages or PD‐L1+ tumor cells in patients who did not compared to those who did achieve CR after CAR‐T therapy. These findings suggest that morphologic patterns in the TME and engagement of the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis in pretreatment biopsies may impact CD19 CAR‐T immunotherapy response in patients with LBCL.">

        <tr id="Reasons for the spectrum of severity of active tuberculosis (TB) disease are incompletely understood. We sought to identify master regulators of host immune responses that determine disease severity in pulmonary TB. We performed molecular profiling of human in vivo immune responses to discover associations with the extent of radiographic TB disease in a patient cohort. We then undertook mechanistic studies to test causality for the observed associations using the zebrafish larval Mycobacterium marinum infection model. Transcriptional profiling of human immune recall responses to tuberculin skin test (TST) challenge, a surrogate for immune responses to TB in the lung, revealed that type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome was inversely associated with radiological disease severity. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, achieved by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of stat2, led to increased susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to M. marinum infection, as a result of reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict mycobacterial growth, to the site of disease. Our data support a host protective role for type I interferon responses in mycobacterial infection, with potential applications for risk-stratification of adverse outcomes and development of a host-directed therapy to mitigate against severe disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="Background Despite continuous improvements in the new target and construction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T, relapse remains a significant challenge following CAR-T therapy. Tumor microenvironment (TME) strongly correlates with the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), which exerts a multifaceted and controversial role in regulating the TME, acts not only as a ligand on antigen-presenting cells but also functions as a receptor on T cells. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanisms governing endogenous T-cell activation by VISTA, which are pivotal for reshaping the TME, remain incompletely elucidated. Methods The immunocompetent B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), lymphoma, and melanoma murine models were employed to investigate the characteristics of endogenous T cells within the TME following CD19 and hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy, respectively. Furthermore, we examined the role of VISTA controlled by interferon (IFN)-γ signaling in regulating endogenous T-cell activation and functionality in B-ALL mice. Results We demonstrated that the administration of CD19 CAR-T or hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy elicited augmented immune responses of endogenous T cells within the TME of B-ALL, lymphoma, and melanoma mice, thereby substantiating the efficacy of CAR-T cell efficacy. However, in the TME lacking IFN-γ signaling, VISTA levels remained elevated, resulting in attenuated cytotoxicity of endogenous T cells and reduced B-ALL recipient survival. Mice treated with CD19 CAR-T cells exhibited increased proportions of endogenous memory T cells during prolonged remission, which possessed the tumor-responsive capabilities to protect against B-ALL re-challenge. Compared with wild-type (WT) CAR-T treated mice, the administration of IFN-γ−/− CAR-T to both WT and IFN-γ−/− recipients resulted in a reduction in the numbers of endogenous CD4+ and CD8+ effectors, while exhibiting increased populations of naïve-like CD4+ T and memory CD8+ T cells. VISTA expression consistently remained elevated in resting or memory CD4+ T cells, with distinct localization from programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expressing T subsets. Blocking the VISTA signal enhanced dendritic cell-induced proliferation and cytokine production by syngeneic T cells. Conclusion Our findings confirm that endogenous T-cell activation and functionality are regulated by VISTA, which is associated with the therapeutic efficiency of CAR-T and provides a promising therapeutic strategy for relapse cases in CAR-T therapy.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Interleukin-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6R Abs), including satralizumab, are increasingly used to prevent relapse for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, the detailed mechanism of action of this treatment on the lymphocyte phenotype remains unclear. This study focused on B cells in patients with NMOSD, hypothesizing that IL-6R Ab enables B cells to acquire regulatory functions by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro to induce the expansion of B-cell subsets, double-negative B cells (DNs; CD19+ IgD−, CD27−) and plasmablasts (PBs; CD19+, CD27hi, CD38hi). Whole B cells, DNs, or PBs were isolated after culture with IL-6R Ab, and IL-10 expression was quantified using quantitative PCR and a cytometric bead array. RNA sequencing was performed to identify the marker of regulatory PBs induced by IL-6R Ab. Results DNs and PBs were observed to expand in patients with NMSOD during the acute attacks. In the in vitro model, IL-6R Ab increased IL-10 expression in B cells. Notably, IL-10 expression increased in PBs but not in DNs. Using RNA sequencing, CD200 was identified as a marker of regulatory PBs among the differentially expressed upregulated genes. CD200+ PBs produced more IL-10 than CD200− PBs. Furthermore, patients with NMOSD who received satralizumab had a higher proportion of CD200+ PBs than patients during the acute attacks. Discussion Treatment with IL-6 signaling blockade elicited a regulatory phenotype in B cells and PBs. CD200+ PBs may be a marker of treatment responsiveness in the context of NMOSD pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, the impact of tumor CD24 on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains poorly explored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, murine CD24 gene, in the progression and immune dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods: We employed Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology to perform a gene knockout of Cd24a in 4T1 cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the distribution and number of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect these immune cells in tumor sections. Additionally, ANDOR Dragonfly High-Speed Confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of mouse tumors. Results Our study showed that knocking out CD24a significantly impeded tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. Flow cytometry and IF analysis revealed that the loss of CD24a transformed tumor microenvironment from cold to hot by promoting the infiltration of M1 macrophages, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and CD49b+ natural killer (NK) cells while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) in the TME. Additionally, the 3D mapping of TME further validated the “hot state” of CD24a knockout tumors. Conclusions Our study provides the first evidence that targeting CD24a could effectively reprogram the TME, enhancing its immunogenicity, and transforming immune cold tumors into hot tumors. This strategy may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response against poorly immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells play pivotal roles in combating intracellular pathogens and eliminating malignant cells in cancer. However, the prognostic role of CD8+ T cells in ovarian carcinoma is insufficiently exploited. Herein, through univariate Cox regression along with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses, we developed a novel prognostic model based on CD8+ T cell markers identified by single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. Patient grouping by the median risk score reveals an excellent prognostic efficacy of this model in both training and validation cohorts. Of note, patients classified as low-risk group exhibit a dramatically improved prognosis. In addition, higher enrichment level of immune-related pathways and increased infiltration level of multiple immune cells are found in patients with lower risk score. Importantly, low-risk patients also exhibited higher response rate to immunotherapies. Summarily, this developed CD8+ T cell-associated prognostic model serves as an excellent predictor for clinical outcomes and aids in guiding therapeutic strategy choices for ovarian cancer patients.">

        <tr id="KLRG1+ CD8 T cells persist for months after clearance of acute infections and maintain high levels of effector molecules, contributing protective immunity against systemic pathogens. Upon secondary infection, these long-lived effector cells (LLECs) are incapable of forming other circulating KLRG1− memory subsets such as central and effector memory T cells. Thus, KLRG1+ memory T cells are frequently referred to as a terminally differentiated population that is relatively short lived. Here, we show that after viral infection of mice, effector cells derived from LLECs rapidly enter nonlymphoid tissues and reduce pathogen burden but are largely dependent on receiving antigen cues from vascular endothelial cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that secondary memory cells in nonlymphoid tissues arising from either KLRG1+ or KLRG1− memory precursors develop a similar resident memory transcriptional signature. Thus, although LLECs cannot differentiate into other circulating memory populations, they still retain the flexibility to enter tissues and establish residency. Circulating KLRG1+ memory T cells rapidly enter nonlymphoid tissues after viral infection and differentiate into resident memory. Editor’s summary Long-lived effector cells (LLECs) are a subset of memory CD8 T cells considered to be terminally differentiated that maintain KLRG1 expression and show distinct trafficking patterns, functions, and proliferative potential compared with other memory T cell subsets. Lucas et al. find in mice that LLECs can migrate from the circulation to nonlymphoid tissues after secondary viral infection in a process that requires the presentation of antigen by blood endothelial cells. Once in tissues, LLECs then acquire a transcriptional program akin to resident memory T (TRM) cells, Thus, LLECs exhibit a previously unappreciated plasticity that allows them to potentially contribute to the tissue-resident memory pool. —Seth Thomas Scanlon">

These conditions are primarily characterized by an immoderate activation of the immune system or deviant immune responses, involving diverse immune components including immune cells, antibodies, and inflammatory mediators. However, the precise molecular dysregulation underlying numerous individual cases of these diseases and unique subsets respond under disease conditions remains elusive. Comprehending the mechanisms and determinants governing the homeostasis and functionality of diseases could offer potential therapeutic opportunities for intervention. Mass cytometry enables precise and high-throughput quantitative measurement of proteins within individual cells by utilizing antibodies labeled with rare heavy metal isotopes. Imaging mass cytometry employs mass spectrometry to obtain spatial information on cell-to-cell interactions within tissue sections, simultaneously utilizing more than 40 markers. The application of single-cell mass cytometry presents a unique opportunity to conduct highly multiplexed analysis at the single-cell level, thereby revolutionizing our understanding of cell population heterogeneity and hierarchy, cellular states, multiplexed signaling pathways, proteolysis products, and mRNA transcripts specifically in the context of many autoimmune diseases. This information holds the potential to offer novel approaches for the diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and monitoring responses to treatment, thereby enriching our strategies in managing the respective conditions. This review summarizes the present-day utilization of single-cell mass cytometry in studying immune-related skin diseases, highlighting its advantages and limitations. This technique will become increasingly prevalent in conducting extensive investigations into these disorders, ultimately yielding significant contributions to their accurate diagnosis and efficacious therapeutic interventions.">

This study investigates, in offspring mice, the effect of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on postnatal physical development, behavior and neurogenesis. After inoculation with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) at gestational day 14.5, antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were detected in serum of both dams and pups. At one month of age, pups born to vaccinated dams, but not the offspring of non-vaccinated dams, exhibited greater working memory and more neural cell proliferation, neuroblast formation, neuronal stem cell activity and larger numbers of mature neurons within the dentate gyrus (DG). Luminex multiplex assay revealed elevated levels of hippocampal cytokines/chemokines critical to neurogenesis and memory function, namely interferon-γ [IFN-γ] and CX3C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CX3CL1]. Conditional knockout technology implicated microglial IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNγR1) and CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) as crucial intercellular participants in the neuronal developmental process, via regulating microglial activation and chemotaxis, respectively.

        <tr id="Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is the causative agent of the majority of Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC). The virus has limited coding capacity, with its early viral proteins, large T (LT) and small T (sT), being multifunctional and contributing to infection and transformation. A fundamental difference in early viral gene expression between infection and MCPyV-driven tumorigenesis is the expression of a truncated LT (LTtr) in the tumor. In contrast, sT is expressed in both conditions and contributes significantly to oncogenesis. Here, we identified novel functions of early viral proteins by performing genome-wide transcriptome and chromatin studies in primary human fibroblasts. Due to current limitations in infection and tumorigenesis models, we mimic these conditions by ectopically expressing sT, LT or LTtr, individually or in combination, at different time points. In addition to its known function in cell cycle and inflammation modulation, we reveal a fundamentally new function of sT. We show that sT regulates the type I interferon (IFN) response downstream of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) by interfering with the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)-induced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) response. Expression of sT leads to a reduction in the expression of interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) which is a central component of the ISGF3 complex. We further show that this function of sT is conserved in BKPyV. We provide a first mechanistic understanding of which early viral proteins trigger and control the type I IFN response, which may influence MCPyV infection, persistence and, during MCC progression, regulation of the tumor microenvironment. Author Summary Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is the only human polyomavirus that causes cancer in humans. As with all human polyomaviruses, the available infection models are limited. Thus, many processes such as the host response to infection and its regulation by the virus to establish infection and persistence are poorly understood. To better understand this interplay of viral MCPyV proteins, we performed genome-wide transcriptome and chromatin studies in primary human fibroblasts and simulated infection and tumorigenesis conditions by ectopically expressing the early viral proteins individually or in combination at different time points. This allowed us to uncover a novel, previously undescribed function of polyomavirus sT, namely the reduction of the ISG response by affecting the ISGF3 complex, specifically by reducing IRF9 protein levels. This work sheds light on how early viral proteins influence the type I IFN response and how their interplay may affect MCPyV infection, persistence, and MCC progression.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for >150,000 deaths every year with a mortality rate as high as 81%. This high medical burden is due, in part, to an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. In a previous study, we identified a cryptococcal atypical pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporter, PDR6, that regulated antifungal resistance and host interactions. Here, we follow-up on the role of PDR6 in cryptococcal virulence. In vivo, mice infected with the pdr6Δ strain display altered symptomatology and disease progression. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in the innate immune cell populations in the pdr6Δ-infected mice when compared to their WT-infected littermates. Furthermore, quantification of pulmonary cytokines/chemokines revealed a robust increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice infected with the pdr6Δ mutant strain. Whereas antifungal treatment of pdr6Δ-infected animals did not affect survival, treatment with a corticosteroid significantly extended survival, highlighting the importance of a balanced/controlled host immune response. We determined that the hyper-inflammatory immune response occurs, in part, because the loss of the Pdr6 transporter indirectly alters the cryptococcal cell wall architecture and results in the increased exposure of chitin, β-glucan, and other cryptococcal-specific pathogen associated molecular patterns. Taken together, this study provides clinical insights regarding cryptococcal pathogenesis while also providing additional functions of PDR-type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in pathogenic fungi. IMPORTANCE Yeasts of the Cryptococcus genus, especially C. neoformans, can cause disease with unacceptably high mortality. This is due to delays in diagnostics, ineffective treatments, and an incomplete understanding of the interactions between this fungus and our immune system. In this study, we expand our knowledge of the biological function of the PDR6 gene, particularly its effect on modulating the host’s immune response. Normally, C. neoformans’s infections are characterized by an anti-inflammatory response that is unable to control the yeast. In the absence of PDR6, the response to the infection is a dysregulated pro-inflammatory response that initially controls the fungi but eventually results in death of the host due to too much tissue damage. This is due, in part, to an altered fungal surface. Given the dual role of PDR6 in modulating antifungal sensitivity and immune responses, this work provides important insights that may lead to new or improved therapeutics.">

 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the pivotal role of the immune response in determining the progression and severity of viral infections. In this paper, we review the most recent studies on the complicated dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system, highlight the importance of understanding these dynamics in developing effective treatments and formulate potent management strategies for COVID-19. We describe the activation of the host's innate immunity and the subsequent adaptive immune response following infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the review emphasizes the immune evasion strategies of the SARS-CoV-2, including inhibition of interferon production and induction of cytokine storms, along with the resulting clinical outcomes. Finally, we assess the efficacy of current treatment strategies, including antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-inflammatory treatments, and discuss their role in providing immunity and preventing severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are pivotal in B cell responses. Activation of the purinergic receptor P2X7 on Tfh cells regulates their activity. We investigated the ATP-P2X7R axis in circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells during Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Methods We analyzed two cohorts: children with RSV infection (moderate, n=30; severe, n=21) and healthy children (n=23). We utilized ELISA to quantify the levels of PreF RSV protein-specific IgG antibodies, IL-21 cytokine, and soluble P2X7R (sP2X7R) in both plasma and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Additionally, luminometry was employed to determine ATP levels in plasma, NPA and supernatant culture. The frequency of cTfh cells, P2X7R expression, and plasmablasts were assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate apoptosis, proliferation, and IL-21 production by cTfh cells, we cultured PBMCs in the presence of Bz-ATP and/or P2X7R antagonist (KN-62) and a flow cytometry analysis was performed. Results In children with severe RSV disease, we observed diminished titers of neutralizing anti-PreF IgG antibodies. Additionally, severe infections, compared to moderate cases, were associated with fewer cTfh cells and reduced plasma levels of IL-21. Our investigation revealed dysregulation in the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection. This was characterized by elevated ATP levels in both plasma and NPA samples, increased expression of P2X7R on cTfh cells, lower levels of sP2X7R, and heightened ATP release from PBMCs upon stimulation, particularly evident in severe cases. Importantly, ATP exposure decreased cTfh proliferative response and IL-21 production, while promoting their apoptosis. The P2X7R antagonist KN-62 mitigated these effects. Furthermore, disease severity positively correlated with ATP levels in plasma and NPA samples and inversely correlated with cTfh frequency. Conclusion Our findings indicate that activation of the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection may contribute to limiting the cTfh cell compartment by promoting cell death and dysfunction, ultimately leading to increased disease severity.">

        <tr id="A natural infection or a vaccination can initially prime the immune system to form immunological memory. The immunity engendered by vaccination against COVID-19 versus natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 has not been well studied in the Indian population. In this study, we compared the immunity conferred by COVID-19 vaccines to naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in a South Indian population. We examined binding and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels against the ancestral and variant lineages and assessed the ex vivo cellular parameters of memory T cells, memory B cells, and monocytes and finally measured the circulating cytokine response. COVID-19 vaccination stimulates heightened levels of IgG antibodies against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, as well as increased binding to the spike protein and neutralizing antibody levels. This enhanced response extends to variant lineages such as B.1.617.2 (Delta, India), B.1.1.529 (Omicron, India), B.1.351 (Beta, South Africa), and B.1.1.7 (Alpha, UK). COVID-19 vaccination differs from SARS-CoV-2 infection by having increased frequencies of classical memory B cells, activated memory B and plasma cells, CD4/CD8 T cells of effector memory, effector cells, stem cell-like memory T cells, and classical and intermediate monocytes and diminished frequencies of CD4/CD8 T cells of central memory and non-classical monocytes in vaccinated individuals in comparison to those with natural infection. Thus, COVID-19 vaccination is characterized by enhanced humoral responses and robust activation of innate and memory T cell responses in comparison to natural infection in a South Indian population.">

        <tr id="Immune-surveillance depends in part on the recognition of peptide variants by T cell antigen receptors. Given that both normal B cells and malignant B cells accumulate mutations we chose a murine model of multiple myeloma to test conditions to induce cell-mediated immunity targeting malignant plasma cell (PC) clones but sparing of normal PCs. Revealing a novel function for intracellular C3d, we discovered that C3d engaged T cell responses against malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow of mice that had developed multiple myeloma spontaneously. Our results show that C3d internalized by cells augments immune surveillance by several mechanisms. In one, C3d induces a master transcription regulator, E2f1, to increase the expression of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, to generate peptides for MHC-I presentation and increase MHC-I expression. In another, C3d increases expression of RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins linked to processing of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) that arise from non-canonical translation and known to promote immunosurveillance. Cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to increased expression and presentation of mutant peptides given the extent of protein misfolding and accumulation of somatic mutations. Accordingly, although C3d can be internalized by any cell, C3d preferentially targets malignant clones by evoking specific T cell mediated immunity (CMI) and sparing most non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. Malignant plasma cell deletion was blocked by cyclosporin or by CD8 depletion confirming that endogenous T cells mediated malignant clone clearance. Besides the potential for therapeutic application our results highlight how intracellular C3d modifies cellular metabolism to augment immune surveillance. One Sentence Summary We show that intracellular soluble fragment 3d of complement (C3d) induces regression of spontaneous multiple myeloma in mice reducing tumor burden by 10 fold, after 8 weeks. C3d enables cell-mediated immunity to target multiple myeloma clones sparing non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. We show that C3d increases the expression of ribosomal subunits associated with the translation of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). C3d also decreases expression of protein arginine methyl transferase (PRMT) 5 which in turn relieves E2f1 repression increasing the expression of Lnc RNAs and derived peptides that evoke anti-tumor cellular immunity. The approach increases MHC-I expression by tumor cells and generates a CMI response that overcomes tumor immune-evasion strategies. Significance Tumors are immunogenic in part because of somatic mutations that originate novel peptides that once presented on MHC engage cell-mediated immunity (CMI). However, in spite of the higher mutation load most tumors evade immunity. We discovered that a component of the complement system (C3d) overcomes tumor immune evasion by augmenting expression of ribosomal proteins and lncRNAs linked to the presentation of novel peptides by tumor cells. C3d induced CMI targets cancer cells sparing non transformed cells uncovering a novel function for complement in immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of disease severity and tissue damage extent. Improving myelin restoration is essential to prevent neurodegeneration and the associated disability in MS patients. However, remyelinating therapies are failing in clinical trials, in part, due to the absence of classifying biomarkers of different endogenous regenerative capacities amongst enrolled patients. We previously reported that circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) at the onset of the murine model of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are associated with milder disease courses and less degree of demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cord lesions, while at peak are indicative of a better symptom recovery. Moreover, M-MDSCs are able to promote in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation towards mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) through the release of the soluble factor osteopontin. Results Here, we show a relationship between disease severity and a gradient of OPCs between the rim and the core in mixed active-inactive lesions of MS patients, along with a positive correlation between M-MDSC density and OPC abundance in the same lesions. We also show that EAE disease severity negatively influences the density of total and newly generated OPCs found associated to the demyelinated lesions of the spinal cord at the peak of the disease. In addition, disease severity also impacts the abundance of newly generated OLs originated either during the effector phase or during the early recovery phase. We also demonstrate the positive association between infiltrated M-MDSCs and the abundance of OPCs in the periplaque of demyelinating lesions at the peak of EAE. Interestingly, circulating M-MDSCs at EAE onset and peak of the disease are directly associated to a higher density of newly generated OLs in the plaque and periplaque, respectively. Conclusion Disease severity clearly impacts oligodendrocyte generation during a neuroinflammatory insult like EAE. Our results set the basis for further studies on M-MDSCs as a promising new biomarker that identify a CNS prone to the generation of new OLs that may contribute to restore myelin.">

        <tr id="Neurological manifestations are a significant complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the underlying mechanisms are yet to be understood. Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced neuroinvasion and encephalitis were observed in K18-hACE2 mice, leading to mortality. Our goal in this study was to gain insights into the molecular pathogenesis of neurological manifestations in this mouse model. To analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brains of mice following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed NanoString gene expression analysis using three individual animal samples at 1, 3, and 6 days post-infection. We identified the DEGs by comparing them to animals that were not infected with the virus. We found that genes upregulated at day 6 post-infection were mainly associated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, and cell death pathways. However, downregulated genes were associated with neurodegeneration and synaptic signaling pathways. In correlation with gene expression profiles, a multiplexed immunoassay showed the upregulation of multiple cytokines and chemokines involved in inflammation and cell death in SARS-CoV-2-infected brains. Furthermore, the pathway analysis of DEGs indicated a possible link between TLR2-mediated signaling pathways and neuroinflammation, as well as pyroptosis and necroptosis in the brain. In conclusion, our work demonstrates neuroinflammation-associated gene expression profiles, which can provide key insight into the severe disease observed in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Pathogenic hantaviruses are maintained world-wide within wild, asymptomatic rodent reservoir hosts, with increasingly frequent human spillover infections resulting in severe hemorrhagic fever disease. With no approved therapeutics or vaccines, research has, until recently, focused on understanding the drivers of immune-mediated pathogenesis. An emerging body of work is now investigating the mechanisms that allow for asymptomatic, persistent infections of mammalian reservoir hosts with highly pathogenic RNA viruses. Despite limited experimental data, several hypotheses have arisen to explain limited or absent disease pathology in reservoir hosts. In this study, we directly tested two leading hypotheses: 1) that reservoir host cells induce a generally muted response to viral insults, and 2) that these viruses employ host-specific mechanisms of innate antiviral antagonism to limit immune activation in reservoir cells. We demonstrate that, in contrast to human endothelial cells which mount a robust antiviral and inflammatory response to pathogenic hantaviruses, primary Norway rat endothelial cells do not induce antiviral gene expression in response to infection with their endemic hantavirus, Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV). Reservoir rat cells do, however, induce strong innate immune responses to exogenous stimulatory RNAs, type I interferon, and infection with Hantaan virus, a closely related hantavirus for which the rat is not a natural reservoir. We also find that SEOV-infected rat endothelial cells remain competent for immune activation induced by exogenous stimuli or subsequent viral infection. Importantly, these findings support an alternative model for asymptomatic persistence within hantavirus reservoir hosts: that efficient viral replication within reservoir host cells prevents the exposure of critical motifs for cellular antiviral recognition and thus limits immune activation that would otherwise result in viral clearance and/or immune-mediated disease. Defining the mechanisms that allow for infection tolerance and persistence within reservoir hosts will reveal novel strategies for viral countermeasures and inform rational surveillance programs. Author Summary Despite the significant, and continual, threat to human health, limited experimental evidence explains the mechanisms that underly asymptomatic zoonotic RNA virus persistence within natural, mammalian reservoir hosts. Here, we investigated whether reservoir host target cells for hantavirus infection are competent for antiviral activation and tested the hypothesis that, through long-term co-evolution, Seoul orthohantavirus actively antagonizes innate antiviral signaling pathways to limit immune induction and prevent viral clearance in primary reservoir cells. While we find no evidence to support these hypotheses, our findings do support an alternative hypothesis that viral replication within the natural reservoir cells may not result in the production of immune-stimulating by-products. The factors that determine viral persistence within the reservoirs may include efficient use of host co-factors for efficient genome replication and/or packaging and warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="Mosquito-borne flaviviruses have emerged as global health threats due to their rapid spread and high disease burden. The initial site of virus replication is the mosquito biting site in the host skin, yet the role of host skin bacteria remains unclear. Here, we observed accelerated progression of Zika virus (ZIKV)-induced disease in mice with depleted skin bacteria by topical antibiotic treatment prior to ZIKV infection. Increased viral loads in the blood, draining lymph node, spleen and brain of antibiotic-treated mice suggested faster ZIKV dissemination. Flow cytometry revealed increased frequencies of T cells in the lymph nodes, along with enhanced activation of T cells in the brain upon antibiotic treatment. The antibiotic-induced phenotype was rescued by restoring the skin bacteria prior to infection. Our findings demonstrate an increased susceptibility to ZIKV infection in mice with depleted skin microbiomes, suggesting a potential role of skin bacteria in modulating the infection outcome.">

        <tr id="Achieving long-term disease control using therapeutic immunomodulation is a long-standing concept with a strong tradition in blood malignancies. Besides allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that continues to provide potentially curative treatment for otherwise challenging diagnoses, recent years have seen impressive progress in immunotherapies for leukemias and lymphomas with immune checkpoint blockade, bispecific monoclonal antibodies, and CAR T cell therapies. Despite their success, non-response, relapse, and immune toxicities remain frequent, thus prioritizing the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms and identifying predictive biomarkers. The increasing availability of single-cell genomic tools now provides a system’s immunology view to resolve the molecular and cellular mechanisms of immunotherapies at unprecedented resolution. Here, we review recent studies that leverage these technological advancements for tracking immune responses, the emergence of immune resistance, and toxicities. As single-cell immune monitoring tools evolve and become more accessible, we expect their wide adoption for routine clinical applications to catalyze more precise therapeutic steering of personal immune responses.">

Our objectives were to determine the differential host gene expression and microbiome profile of human skin aGVHD samples compared to normal skin, and aGVHD corticosteroid responders to non-responders. We performed RNA-Sequencing on lower arm biopsies from 45 patients compared to 10 healthy controls. Our findings suggest a distinctive transcriptional signature of cutaneous aGVHD, that could identify potentially actionable targets for prevention or treatment corticosteroid refractory disease. Our analysis suggests a key role of dendritic cells and macrophages, potentially mediated by differential expression of MIF, in the development of cutaneous aGVHD and corticosteroid responsiveness. Additionally, we describe a unique microbial signature in cutaneous aGVHD that includes skin microbes not previously described in this population.">

        <tr id="A comprehensive immune landscape for Brucella infection is crucial for developing new treatments for brucellosis. Here, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of 290,369 cells from 35 individuals, including 29 brucellosis patients from acute (n = 10), sub‐acute (n = 9), and chronic (n = 10) phases as well as six healthy donors. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were applied for validation within this cohort. Brucella infection caused a significant change in the composition of peripheral immune cells and inflammation was a key feature of brucellosis. Acute patients are characterized by potential cytokine storms resulting from systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, primarily due to classical monocytes. Cytokine storm may be mediated by activating S100A8/A9‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, monocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells were the probable contributors to immune paralysis in acute patients. Chronic patients are characterized by a dysregulated Th1 response, marked by reduced expression of IFN‐γ and Th1 signatures as well as a high exhausted state. Additionally, Brucella infection can suppress apoptosis in myeloid cells (e.g., mDCs, classical monocytes), inhibit antigen presentation in professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs; e.g., mDC) and nonprofessional APCs (e.g., monocytes), and induce exhaustion in CD8+ T/NK cells, potentially resulting in the establishment of chronic infection. Overall, our study systemically deciphered the coordinated immune responses of Brucella at different phases of the infection, which facilitated a full understanding of the immunopathogenesis of brucellosis and may aid the development of new effective therapeutic strategies, especially for those with chronic infection.">

Mature TLS, characterized by germinal centers and areas of T-cell and B-cell aggregation, are considered primary locations for activating and maintaining both humoral and cellular anti-tumor immune effects. Despite their recognized importance, the mechanisms driving the formation of mature TLS in cancer and their influence on the immune response within tumors remain insufficiently understood. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively explore the structural composition, development mechanisms, maturity impact factors, immunological function, and innovative therapeutic strategies of mature TLS within the tumor microenvironment.

We investigated the impact of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) on blood-derived MAIT cells and report virus-mediated impairment of activation, cytokine production, and altered transcription factor expression by VZV infected (antigen+) and VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells in response to TCR-dependent and -independent stimulation. Furthermore, we reveal that suppression of VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells is not mediated by a soluble factor from neighbouring VZV infected (antigen+) MAIT cells. Finally, we demonstrate that VZV impairs the cytolytic potential of MAIT cells in response to riboflavin synthesising bacteria. In summary, we report a virus-mediated immune-evasion strategy that disarms MAIT cell responses.">

It undergoes development during fetal stages and continuously learns from each encounter with pathogens, allowing it to develop immunological memory and provide a wide range of immune protection. Over time, after numerous encounters and years of functioning, the immune system can begin to show signs of erosion, which is commonly named immunosenescence. In this review, we aim to explore how the immune system responds to initial encounters with antigens and how it handles persistent stimulations throughout a person’s lifetime. Our understanding of the immune system has greatly benefited from advanced technologies like flow cytometry. In this context, we will discuss the valuable contribution of flow cytometry in enhancing our knowledge of the immune system behavior in aging, with a specific focus on T-cells. Moreover, we will expand our discussion to the flow cytometry-based assessment of extracellular vesicles, a recently discovered communication channel in biology, and their implications for immune system functioning.">

EOMES+type-1 regulatory (EOMES+Tr1-like) T-cells had a dysregulated homeostasis in multiple sclerosis (MS), which was related to their activation in the central nervous system (CNS). EOMES+Tr1-like cells were strongly enriched in patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and were the main IL-10-producing T-cells in the CSF. IL-10+EOMES+Tr1-like were present in MS brain lesions, and some were found close to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-infected B-cells. EOMES+Tr1-like cells and FOXP3+Tregs produced IL-10 with EBV-derived antigens, but not with major myelin antigens. EOMES+Tr1-like cells responded selectively to the latency-associated antigen EBNA1, whereas FOXP3+Tregs responded also to lytic antigens. EBNA1-specific EOMES+Tr1-like cells were associated with anti-EBNA1 IgG, disappeared upon therapeutic B-cell depletion and were relatively abundant in patients with the HLA-DRB1*15 risk haplotype. The aberrant anti-viral specificities of Tregs in MS could undermine their protective functions and anti-EBV immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 presents with a plethora of neurological signs and symptoms despite being characterized as a respiratory disease, including seizures, anxiety, depression, amnesia, attention deficits, and alterations in consciousness. The olfactory nerve is widely accepted as the neuroinvasive route by which the etiological agent SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain, but the trigeminal nerve is an often-overlooked additional route. Based on this consensus, we initially conducted a pilot experiment investigating the olfactory nerve route of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion via intranasal inoculation in AC70 human ACE2 transgenic mice. Notably, we found that the trigeminal ganglion is an early and highly efficient site of viral replication, which then rapidly spread widely throughout the brain where neurons were primarily targeted. Despite the extensive viral infection across the brain, obvious evidence of tissue pathology including inflammatory infiltration, glial activation, and apoptotic cell deaths were not consistently observed, albeit inflammatory cytokines were significantly induced. However, the expression levels of different genes related to neuronal function, including the neurotransmitter dopamine pathway as well as synaptic function, and markers of neuronal damage were altered as compared to mock-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the trigeminal nerve can be a neuroinvasive route complementary to the olfactory nerve and that the ensuing neuroinvasion presented a unique neuropathological profile. This study provides insights into potential neuropathogenic mechanisms utilized by coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE COVID-19 presents with extrapulmonary signs and symptoms, the most notable of which involve the central nervous system, such as seizures and alterations in consciousness, and can eventually lead to death if severe enough. Some neurological signs and symptoms may continue to persist in some patients even after the resolution of active viral infection in the form of post-acute sequelae. Since the trigeminal nerve is a commonly under-studied route of entry into the brain in studies of coronaviruses and the neuropathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 are not entirely elucidated, there is a need to thoroughly investigate this route of neuroinvasion. The significance of our research is in providing insights into the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion as well as the discovery of potential neuropathogenic mechanisms which may help guide the development of novel medical countermeasures.">

L-phenylalanine also restrains memory CD4+T proliferation in an IL4I1-dependent manner and inhibits Th2 cell proliferation and differentiation.

        <tr id="Type I interferons (IFN-I) are cytokines with potent antiviral and inflammatory capacities. IFN-I signaling drives the expression of hundreds of IFN-I stimulated genes (ISGs), whose aggregate function results in the control of viral infection. A few of these ISGs are tasked with negatively regulating the IFN-I response to prevent overt inflammation. ISG15 is a negative regulator whose absence leads to persistent, low-grade elevation of ISG expression and concurrent, self-resolving mild autoinflammation. The limited breadth and low-grade persistence of ISGs expressed in ISG15 deficiency are sufficient to confer broad-spectrum antiviral resistance. Inspired by ISG15 deficiency, we have identified a nominal collection of 10 ISGs that recapitulate the broad antiviral potential of the IFN-I system. The expression of the 10 ISG collection in an IFN-I non-responsive cell line increased cellular resistance to Zika, Vesicular Stomatitis, Influenza A (IAV), and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A deliverable prophylactic formulation of this syndicate of 10 ISGs significantly inhibited IAV PR8 replication in vivo in mice and protected hamsters against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, suggesting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral against many current and future emerging viral pathogens.

        <tr id="Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBMs) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to re-polarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFNs on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a pro-inflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBMs displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAMs. These findings uncover type I IFN-inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of stem cells originating in the bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that AML survival and relapse are controlled by genetic alterations, as well as a functional interaction between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the biology of immune evasion in AML and explore the current landscape of immune-based therapies. We argue that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment in AML could help predict responses to immunotherapy and guide decisions for future treatment. Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematopoietic clonal disorder with limited curative options beyond stem cell transplantation. The success of transplant is intimately linked with the graft versus leukemia effect from the alloreactive donor immune cells including, T and NK cells. The immune system plays a dynamic role in leukemia survival and resistance. Despite our growing understanding of the immune microenvironment, responses to immune-based therapies differ greatly between patients. Herein, we review the biology of immune evasion mechanisms in AML, discuss the current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, and discuss the implications of therapeutic targets. This review focuses on T and NK cell-based therapy, including modified and non-modified NK cells, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, antibodies, and checkpoint blockades. Understanding the complex interchange between immune tolerance and the emergence of tumor resistance will improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Nearly six million people worldwide have died from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although COVID-19 vaccines are largely successful in reducing the severity of the disease and deaths, the decline in vaccine-induced immunity over time and the continuing emergence of new viral variants or mutations underscore the need for an alternative strategy for developing broad-spectrum host-mediated therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. A key feature of severe COVID-19 is dysregulated innate immune signaling, culminating in a high expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a lack of antiviral interferons (IFNs), particularly type I (alpha and beta) and type III (lambda). As a natural host defense, the myeloid differentiation primary response protein, MyD88, plays pivotal roles in innate and acquired immune responses via the signal transduction pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a type of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). However, recent studies have highlighted that infection with viruses upregulates MyD88 expression and impairs the host antiviral response by negatively regulating type I IFN. Galectin-3 (Gal3), another key player in viral infections, has been shown to modulate the host immune response by regulating viral entry and activating TLRs, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and NF-κB, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributing to the overall inflammatory response, the so-called “cytokine storm”. These studies suggest that the specific inhibition of MyD88 and Gal3 could be a promising therapy for COVID-19. This review presents future directions for MyD88- and Gal3-targeted antiviral drug discovery, highlighting the potential to restore host immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT There are no licensed vaccines for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and current antiviral drugs that target viral proteins are toxic and prone to resistance. Targeting host pathways essential for virus replication provides an alternate strategy that may reduce opportunities for drug resistance to occur. Oxidative stress is triggered by numerous viruses including HCMV. Peroxynitrite is a reactive nitrogen species that is formed during oxidative stress. Herein, we identified that HCMV rapidly induces the generation of intracellular peroxynitrite upon infection in a manner partially dependent upon xanthine oxidase generation. Peroxynitrite promoted HCMV infection in both cell-free and cell-associated infection systems in multiple cell types. Inhibiting peroxynitrite within the first 24 hours of infection prevented HCMV replication and peroxynitrite promoted cell entry and pp65 translocation into the host cell nuclei. Furthermore, using the murine cytomegalovirus model, we demonstrated that antagonizing peroxynitrite significantly reduces cytomegalovirus replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Overall, our study highlights a proviral role for peroxynitrite in CMV infection and implies that RNS and/or the mechanisms that induce their production could be targeted as a novel strategy to inhibit HCMV infection. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes significant disease in individuals with impaired or immature immune systems, such as transplant patients and after congenital infection. Antiviral drugs that target the virus directly are toxic and are susceptible to antiviral drug resistance due to virus mutations. An alternate strategy is to target processes within host cells that are required by the virus for replication. Herein, we show that HCMV infection triggers a highly reactive molecule, peroxynitrite, during the initial stages of infection. Peroxynitrite was required for the initial entry of the virus into the cell and promotes virus replication in multiple cell types, suggesting a broad pro-viral function. Importantly, targeting peroxynitrite dramatically inhibited cytomegalovirus replication in cells in the laboratory and in mice, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of this molecule and/or the cellular functions it regulates could represent a novel strategy to inhibit HCMV infection.

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the adaptive immune system has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Despite impressive clinical benefits observed, patient subgroups remain non-responsive underscoring the necessity for combinational therapies harnessing additional immune cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are emerging tools for cancer therapy. However, only subpopulations of NK cells that are differentially controlled by inhibitory receptors exert reactivity against particular cancer types. How to leverage the complete anti-tumor potential of all NK cell subsets without favoring the emergence of NK cell-resistant tumor cells remains unresolved. Methods We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout resistance screen in melanoma cells in co-cultures with human primary NK cells. We comprehensively evaluated factors regulating tumor resistance and susceptibility by focusing on NK cell subsets in an allogenic setting. Moreover, we tested therapeutic blocking antibodies currently used in clinical trials. Results Melanoma cells deficient in antigen-presenting or the IFNγ-signaling pathways were depleted in remaining NK cell-co-cultured melanoma cells and displayed enhanced sensitivity to NK cells. Treatment with IFNγ induced potent resistance of melanoma cells to resting, IL-2-cultured and ADCC-activated NK cells that depended on B2M required for the expression of both classical and non-classical MHC-I. IFNγ-induced expression of HLA-E mediated the resistance of melanoma cells to the NKG2A+ KIR− and partially to the NKG2A+ KIR+ NK cell subset. The expression of classical MHC-I by itself was sufficient for the inhibition of the NKG2A− KIR+, but not the NKG2A+ KIR+ NK cell subset. Treatment of NK cells with monalizumab, an NKG2A blocking mAb, enhanced the reactivity of a corresponding subset of NK cells. The combination of monalizumab with lirilumab, blocking KIR2 receptors, together with DX9, blocking KIR3DL1, was required to restore cytotoxicity of all NK cell subsets against IFNγ-induced resistant tumor cells in melanoma and tumors of different origins. Conclusion Our data reveal that in the context of NK cells, IFNγ induces the resistance of tumor cells by the upregulation of classical and non-classical MHC-I. Moreover, we reveal insights into NK cell subset reactivity and propose a therapeutic strategy involving combinational monalizumab/lirilumab/DX9 treatment to fully restore the antitumor response across NK cell subsets.">

        <tr id="The liver harbors a diverse array of immune cells during both health and disease. The specific roles of these cells in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Using a systems immunology approach, we demonstrate that reciprocal cell-cell communications function through dominant-subdominant pattern of ligand-receptor homeostatic pathways. In the healthy control, hepatocyte-dominated homeostatic pathways induce local immune responses to maintain liver homeostasis. Chronic intake of a Western diet (WD) alters hepatocytes and induces hepatic stellate cell (HSC), cancer cell and NKT cell-dominated interactions during NAFLD. During HCC, monocytes, hepatocytes, and myofibroblasts join the dominant cellular interactions network to restore liver homeostasis. Dietary correction during NAFLD results in nonlinear outcomes with various cellular rearrangements. When cancer cells and stromal cells dominate hepatic interactions network without inducing homeostatic immune responses, HCC progression occurs. Conversely, myofibroblast and fibroblast-dominated network orchestrates monocyte-dominated HCC-preventive immune responses. Tumor immune surveillance by 75% of immune cells successfully promoting liver homeostasis can create a tumor-inhibitory microenvironment, while only 5% of immune cells manifest apoptosis-inducing functions, primarily for facilitating homeostatic liver cell turnover rather than direct tumor killing. These data suggest that an effective immunotherapy should promote liver homeostasis rather than direct tumor killing.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
T-cell-mediated immunity is crucial for the effective clearance of viral infection, but the T-cell-mediated immune responses that are induced by booster doses of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) remain unclear.


METHODS
Forty-five PLWH who had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for more than two years and 29 healthy controls (HCs) at Beijing Youan Hospital were enrolled to assess the dynamic changes in T-cell responses between the day before the third vaccine dose (week 0) and 4 or 12 weeks (week 4 or week 12) after receiving the third dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot), and multiplex cytokines profiling were used to assess T-cell responses at the three timepoints in this study.


RESULTS
The results of the ELISpot and activation-induced marker (AIM) assays showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were increased in both PLWH and HCs after the third dose of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and a similar magnitude of immune response was induced against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant compared to the wild-type strain. In detail, spike-specific T-cell responses (measured by the ELISpot assay for interferon γ [IFN-γ] release) in both PLWH and HCs significantly increased in week 4, and the spike-specific T-cell responses in HCs were significantly stronger than those in PLWH 4 weeks after the third vaccination. In the AIM assay, spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses peaked in both PLWH and HCs in week 12. Additionally, significantly higher spike-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were induced in PLWH than in HCs in week 12. In PLWH, the release of the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-22 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were stimulated with spike peptides increased in week 12. In addition, the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 were higher in PLWH than in HCs in week 12. Interestingly, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses in PLWH was negatively associated with the extent of CD8+ T-cell activation and exhaustion. In addition, positive correlations were observed between the magnitude of spike-specific T-cell responses (determined by measuring IFN-γ release by ELISpot) and the amounts of IL-4, IL-5, IL-2 and IL-17F.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses could be enhanced by the booster dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines and further illustrate the importance of additional vaccination for PLWH.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB) persists as a global health challenge, with its treatment hampered by the side effects of long-term combination drug therapies and the growing issue of drug resistance. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is critical. This study focuses on the role of immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) and functions of CD8+ T cells in the search for new potential targets against TB. Methods We conducted differential expression genes analysis and CD8+ T cell functional gene analysis on 92 TB samples and 61 healthy individual (HI) samples from TB database GSE83456, which contains data on 34,603 genes. The GSE54992 dataset was used to validated the findings. Additionally, a cluster analysis on single-cell data from primates infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and those vaccinated with BCG was performed. Results The overexpression of LAG-3 gene was found as a potentially important characteristic of both pulmonary TB (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Further correlation analysis showed that LAG-3 gene was correlated with GZMB, perforin, IL-2 and IL-12. A significant temporal and spatial variation in LAG-3 expression was observed in T cells and macrophages during TB infection and after BCG vaccination. Conclusion LAG-3 was overexpressed in TB samples. Targeting LAG-3 may represent a potential therapeutic target for tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Macrophages and T-cells play critical roles in β-cell death leading to T1D. We find that reduction of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2β in macrophages alone reduces T1D. To explore the potential mechanism, we examined changes in immune-responsive genes by single-cell RNAseq analysis using a false discovery rate (FDR)<1e10-8. In the BMDM from NOD.cM ΦiPLA2 β-/-, relative to NOD, we find that genes (Slc25a5, Ephx1, Zcchc14) related to inflammation, immune cell infiltration, T-cell activation, antigen presentation, MΦ proliferation, and mitochondrial metabolism were down-regulated, and those that promote M2M Φ polarization (Ccl6) and MΦ-phagocytosis (Tbc1d10c), and reduce MΦ infiltration (Creb313), CD8 T-cell activation (Ccl4), and mitochondrial production of anti-inflammatory itaconate (Acod1) were up-regulated. Intriguingly, nearly 30 DEGs were noted in islet CD4 and CD8 T-cells from NOD.cM ΦiPLA2 β-/-, relative to NOD. In the CD4 cells, genes (Tnfrs23, Jak2, H2-Aa) related to inflammation, activation of T-cells, and antigen presentation were downregulated, whereas genes related to Treg generation (Gpr83) and negative regulation of Th-cell activation (Cd160) were upregulated. In the CD8 cells, genes associated with enhancing inflammation (Epas1, Gata3), CD8 T-cell activation (Nkg7, Ctla2b), CD4 T-cell activation (Gldc), and (4) negative modulation of Treg cell generation (Ctla2a) were down-regulated, while genes (Gbp2b, Gpr83) associated with Tregs were upregulated. Importantly, the top 7 of 16 shared T-cell pathways were related to inflammation. Similar transcriptome profiles were also evident in NOD.cM ΦiPLA2 β-/- islet B and NK cells, relative to NOD. These findings reveal that lipid signaling from macrophages affects the transcriptome in macrophages, triggering islet immune cell transcriptome favoring an inflammatory phenotype. They further suggest that targeting iPLA2β-derived lipid signaling in macrophages is a means to reduce T1D incidence.

        <tr id="CD36 expression in both immune and non-immune cells is known to be directly involved in cancer metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by malignant melanocytes play a vital role in developing tumor-promoting microenvironments, but it is unclear whether this is mediated through CD36. To understand the role of CD36 in melanoma, we first analyzed the SKCM dataset for clinical prognosis, evaluated the percentage of CD36 in lymphatic fluid-derived EVs (LEVs), and tested whether melanoma-derived EVs increase CD36 expression and induce M2-macrophage-like characteristics. Furthermore, we performed a multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging analysis to evaluate the CD36 expression and its colocalization with various other cells in the lymph node (LN) of patients and control subjects. Our findings show that cutaneous melanoma patients have a worse clinical prognosis with high CD36 levels, and a higher percentage of CD36 in total LEVs were found at baseline in melanoma patients compared to control. We also found that monocytic and endothelial cells treated with melanoma EVs expressed more CD36 than untreated cells. Furthermore, melanoma-derived EVs can regulate immunosuppressive macrophage-like characteristics by upregulating CD36. The spatial imaging data show that cells in tumor-involved sentinel LNs exhibit a higher probability of CD36 expression than cells from control LNs, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusively, our findings demonstrated that CD36 plays a vital role in controlling the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the LN, which can promote the formation of a protumorigenic niche.">

        <tr id="Abstract Haematopoiesis dysregulation with the presence of immature myeloid and erythroid immunosuppressive cells are key characteristics of the immune escape phase of tumour development. Here, the role of in vitro generated B16F10 tumour cell‐derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) as indirect cellular communicators, participating in tumour‐induced dysregulation of haematopoiesis, was explored. The isolated tEVs displayed features of small EVs with a size range of 100–200 nm, expressed the common EV markers CD63, CD9, and Alix, and had a spherical shape with a lipid bilayer membrane. Proteomic profiling revealed significant levels of angiogenic factors, particularly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), osteopontin, and tissue factor, associated with the tEVs. Systemic administration of these tEVs in syngeneic mice induced splenomegaly and disrupted haematopoiesis, leading to extramedullary haematopoiesis, expansion of splenic immature erythroid progenitors, reduced bone marrow cellularity, medullary expansion of granulocytic myeloid suppressor cells, and the development of anaemia. These effects closely mirrored those observed in tumour‐bearing mice and were not seen after heat inactivating the tEVs. In vitro studies demonstrated that tEVs independently induced the expansion of bone marrow granulocytic myeloid suppressor cells and B cells while reducing the frequency of cells in the erythropoietic lineage. These effects of tEVs were significantly abrogated by the blockade of VEGF or heat inactivation. Our findings underscore the important role of tEVs in dysregulating haematopoiesis during the immune escape phase of cancer immunoediting, suggesting their potential as targets for addressing immune evasion and reinstating normal hematopoietic processes.">

Severe sepsis could incite an uncontrollable surge of inflammatory cytokines, and the host immune system's immunosuppression could respond to counter excessive inflammatory responses, characterized by the accumulated anti-inflammatory cytokines, impaired function of immune cells, over-proliferation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, depletion of immune effector cells by different means of death, etc. In this review, we delve into the underlying pathological mechanisms of sepsis, emphasizing both the hyperinflammatory phase and the associated immunosuppression. We offer an in-depth exploration of the critical mechanisms underlying sepsis, spanning from individual immune cells to a holistic organ perspective, and further down to the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, we outline the strengths of artificial intelligence in analyzing extensive datasets pertaining to septic patients, showcasing how classifiers trained on various clinical data sources can identify distinct sepsis phenotypes and thus to guide personalized therapy strategies for the management of sepsis. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent, reliable biomarkers for hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive states, facilitating more precise and expedited diagnosis of sepsis.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells play a key role in inflammation as a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it remains unclear how innate immunity-mediated inflammation is fine-tuned to minimize tissue damage and assure the host’s survival at the early phase of systemic inflammation. The results of this study with mouse models demonstrate that the supply of monocytes is restricted depending on the magnitude of inflammation. During the acute phase of severe inflammation, monocytes, but not neutrophils, were substantially reduced by apoptosis and the remaining monocytes were dysfunctional in the bone marrow. Monocyte-specific ablation of Casp3/7 prevented monocyte apoptosis but promoted monocyte necrosis in the bone marrow, leading to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the increased mortality of mice during systemic inflammation. Importantly, the limitation of monocyte supply was dependent on pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Consistently, a reduction of monocytes was observed in the peripheral blood during cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) patients, a pathogen-unrelated systemic inflammation induced by chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy. Thus, monocytes act as a safety valve to alleviate tissue damage caused by inflammation and ensure host survival, which may be responsible for a primitive immune-control mechanism that does not require intervention by acquired immunity.">

        <tr id="Co-infections are a common reality but understanding how the immune system responds in this context is complex and can be unpredictable. Heligmosomoides bakeri (parasitic roundworm, previously Heligmosomoides polygyrus) and Toxoplasma gondii (protozoan parasite) are well studied organisms that stimulate a characteristic Th2 and Th1 response, respectively. Several studies have demonstrated reduced inflammatory cytokine responses in animals co-infected with such organisms. However, while general cytokine signatures have been examined, the impact of the different cytokine producing lymphocytes on parasite control/clearance is not fully understood. We investigated five different lymphocyte populations (NK, NKT, γδ T, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells), five organs (small intestine, Peyer’s patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver), and 4 cytokines (IFN©, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13) at two different time points (days 5 and 10 post T. gondii infection). We found that co-infected animals had significantly higher mortality than either single infection. This was accompanied by transient and local changes in parasite loads and cytokine profiles. Despite the early changes in lymphocyte and cytokine profiles, severe intestinal pathology in co-infected mice likely contributed to early mortality due to significant damage by both parasites in the small intestine. Our work demonstrates the importance of taking a broad view during infection research, studying multiple cell types, organs/tissues and time points to link and/or uncouple immunological from pathological findings. Our results provide insights into how co-infection with parasites stimulating different arms of the immune system can lead to drastic changes in infection dynamics.">

This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The distinct functions of immune cells in atherosclerosis have been mostly defined by preclinical mouse studies. Contrastingly, the immune cell composition of human atherosclerotic plaques and their contribution to disease progression is only poorly understood. It remains uncertain whether genetic animal models allow for valuable translational approaches.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to define the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The human immune cell repertoire demonstrated an unexpectedly high heterogeneity and was dominated by cells of the T-cell lineage, a finding confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Bioinformatical integration with 7 mouse scRNA-seq data sets from adventitial and atherosclerotic vascular tissue revealed a total of 51 identities of cell types and differentiation states, of which some were only poorly conserved between species and exclusively found in humans. Locations, frequencies, and transcriptional programs of immune cells in mouse models did not resemble the immune cell landscape in human carotid atherosclerosis. In contrast to standard mouse models of atherosclerosis, human plaque leukocytes were dominated by several T-cell phenotypes with transcriptional hallmarks of T-cell activation and memory formation, T-cell receptor-, and pro-inflammatory signaling. Only mice at the age of 22 months partially resembled the activated T-cell phenotype. In a validation cohort of 43 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the abundance of activated immune cell subsets in the plaque defined by multi-color flow cytometry associated with the extend of clinical atherosclerosis.


CONCLUSIONS
Integrative scRNA-seq reveals a substantial difference in the immune cell composition of murine and human carotid atherosclerosis - a finding that questions the translational value of standard mouse models for adaptive immune cell studies. Clinical associations suggest a specific role for T-cell driven (auto-) immunity in human plaque formation and -instability.">

        <tr id="Most healthy individuals recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas a remarkable number continues to suffer from unexplained symptoms, known as Long COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). It is therefore imperative that methods for preventing and treating the onset of PASC be investigated with the utmost urgency.A mathematical model of the immune response to vaccination and viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, incorporating immune memory cells, was developed.Similar to our previous model, persistent infection was observed by the residual virus in the host, implying the possibility of chronic inflammation and delayed recovery from tissue injury. Pre-infectious vaccination and antiviral medication administered during onset can reduce the acute viral load; however, they show no beneficial effects in preventing persistent infection. Therefore, the impact of these treatments on the PASC, which has been clinically observed, is mainly attributed to their role in preventing severe tissue damage caused by acute viral infections. For PASC patients with persistent infection, vaccination was observed to cause an immediate rapid increase in viral load, followed by a temporary decrease over approximately one year. The former was effectively suppressed by the coadministration of antiviral medications, indicating that this combination is a promising treatment for PASC.">

        <tr id="Background The emergence of the hypermutated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) BA.2.86 variant raises significant concerns due to its potential to evade pre-existing immunity. Methods We measured cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses to BA.2.86 in 52 previously exposed participants and investigated clinic-demographic and viral genetic determinants affecting T-cell responses. Findings We found that despite notable escape from neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses remained generally preserved, albeit with a significant but small loss in T-cell cross-recognition (7.5 %, 14.2 % and 10.8 % average loss for IFN-g, IL-2 and IFN-g + IL-2, respectively, p < 0.05). This is consistent with the prediction of 6 out of 10 immunodominant T-cell epitopes (TCEs) altered by BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutations to have reduced peptide presentation. This effect is expected to be mitigated due to total TCEs across the genome. Remarkably, T-cell responses and cross-recognition were 3.5 (IFN-g), 2 (IL-2) and 2.4 (IFN-g + IL-2) times higher when first induced by natural infection rather than vaccination three years before, by increasing number of infections, and by ancestral/Delta than Omicron infections. Interpretation Our findings underscore the critical role and the factors influencing T-cell immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as first antigen encounter (vaccination or infection), which is essential for developing effective control strategies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal cancers, which include a variety of esophageal and colorectal malignancies, present a global health challenge and require effective treatment strategies. In the evolving field of cancer immunotherapy, tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm cells) have emerged as important players in the immune response within nonlymphoid tissues. In this review, we summarize the characteristics and functions of Trm cells and discuss their profound implications for patient outcomes in gastrointestinal cancers. Positioned strategically in peripheral tissues, Trm cells have functions beyond immune surveillance, affecting tumor progression, prognosis, and response to immunotherapy. Studies indicate that Trm cells are prognostic markers and correlate positively with enhanced survival. Their presence in the tumor microenvironment has sparked interest in their therapeutic potential, particularly with respect to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which may improve cancer treatment. Understanding how Trm cells work will not only help to prevent cancer spread through effective treatment but will also contribute to disease prevention at early stages as well as vaccine development. The role of Trm cells goes beyond just cancer, and they have potential applications in infectious and autoimmune diseases. This review provides a thorough analysis of Trm cells in gastrointestinal cancers, which may lead to personalized and effective cancer therapies.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) destroy virally infected cells and are critical for the elimination of viral infections such as those caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Delayed and dysfunctional adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are associated with poor outcomes. Treatment with allogeneic SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs may enhance cellular immunity in high-risk patients and provide a safe, direct mechanism of treatment. Thirty high-risk ambulatory patients with COVID-19 were enrolled on a phase I trial to assess the safety of 3rd party, SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs. Twelve Interventional patients, 6 of whom were immunocompromised, matched the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 restriction of the CTLs and received a single infusion of one of four escalating doses of a product containing 68.5% SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ CTLs/total cells. Symptom improvement and resolution in these patients was compared to an Observational group of eighteen patients lacking HLA-A*02:01 who could receive standard of care. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at any dosing level. Nasal swab PCR data showed ≥ 88% and >99% viral elimination from baseline in all patients at 4- and 14-days post-infusion. The CTLs did not interfere with the development of endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral or cellular responses. T-cell receptor beta (TCR) analysis comparing SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses derived from the CTL donor versus recipients showed persistence of donor-derived CTLs through the end of the 6-month follow-up period. Interventional patients consistently reported symptomatic improvement 2-3 days after infusion, whereas improvement was more variable in Observational patients. This study shows that SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs are a potentially feasible cellular therapy for COVID-19 illness. (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04765449).">

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers are molecular agents, usually antibody-based constructs, engineered to recruit immune cells against cancer cells and kill them. They represent a versatile and powerful tool for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the multiplication of new engagers tested and accepted in the clinics, how molecular and cellular parameters influence their action is poorly understood. In particular, disentangling the respective role of host immune cells and engager biophysical characteristics is needed to improve their design and efficiency. Focusing here on harnessing antibody dependent Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity, we measure the efficiency of 6 original bispecific antibodies (bsAb), associating an anti-HER2 nanobody and an anti-CD16 nanobody. In vitro cytotoxicity data using primary human NK cells on different target cell lines exposing different antigen densities were collected, exhibiting a wide range of bsAb dose response. In order to rationalize our observations, we introduce a simple multiscale model, postulating that the density of bsAb bridging the two cells is the main parameter triggering the cytotoxic response. We introduce two new microscopic parameters: the surface cooperativity describing bsAb affinity at the bridging step and the threshold of bridge density determining the donor-dependent response. Both parameters permit to rank Abs and donors and to predict bsAb potency as a function of antibodies bulk affinities and receptor surface densities on cells. Our approach thus provides a general way to decouple donor response from immune engagers characteristics, rationalizing the landscape of molecule design.">

Several studies support the idea that innate immunity, through the release of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines and tumor growth factors, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM). Cutaneous melanoma is the most common skin cancer, with an incidence that rapidly increased in recent decades. Melanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor, due to its high mutational burden. The metastatic form retains a high mortality. The advent of immunotherapy revolutionized the therapeutic approach to this tumor and significantly ameliorated the patients’ clinical outcome.

        <tr id="Our study investigated the innate immune response to Toxoplasma gondii infection by assessing microglial phenotypic changes and sickness behavior as inflammatory response markers post-ocular tachyzoite instillation. Disease progression in Swiss albino mice was compared with the previously documented outcomes in BALB/c mice using an identical ocular route and parasite burden (2 × 105 tachyzoites), with saline as the control. Contrary to expectations, the Swiss albino mice displayed rapid, lethal disease progression, marked by pronounced sickness behaviors and mortality within 11–12 days post-infection, while the survivors exhibited no apparent signs of infection. Comparative analysis revealed the T. gondii-infected BALB/c mice exhibited reduced avoidance of feline odors, while the infected Swiss albino mice showed enhanced avoidance responses. There was an important increase in microglial cells in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of the infected Swiss albino mice compared to the BALB/c mice and their respective controls. Hierarchical cluster and discriminant analyses identified three microglial morphological clusters, differentially affected by T. gondii infection across strains. The BALB/c mice exhibited increased microglial branching and complexity, while the Swiss albino mice showed reduced shrunken microglial arbors, diminishing their morphological complexity. These findings highlight strain-specific differences in disease progression and inflammatory regulation, indicating lineage-specific mechanisms in inflammatory responses, tolerance, and resistance. Understanding these elements is critical in devising control measures for toxoplasmosis.">

        <tr id="Cytokine storm is usually described as one of the main reasons behind COVID-associated mortality. Cytokines are essential protein molecules engaged in immune responses; they play a critical role in protection against infections. However, they also contribute to inflammatory reactions and tissue damage, becoming a double-edged sword in the context of COVID-19. Recent studies have suggested various cytokines and chemokines that play a crucial role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such cytokine is interleukin 27 (IL-27), which has been found to be elevated in the blood plasma of patients with COVID-19. Within this study, we will explore the role of IL-27 in immune responses and analyze both the existing literature and our own prior research findings on this cytokine in the context of COVID-19. It affects a wide variety of immune cells. Regardless of the pathological process it is involved in, IL-27 is critical for upholding the necessary balance between tissue damage and cytotoxicity against infectious agents and/or tumors. In COVID-19, it is involved in multiple processes, including antiviral cytotoxicity via CD8+ cells, IgG subclass switching, and even the activation of Tregs.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in infants presents distinctive challenges due to their developing immune systems and unique viral-host interactions compared to adults. This review examines current knowledge on viral-host interactions and immune responses in HIV-infected infants, focusing on immune development, viral dynamics, and therapeutic implications. The immune system of infants undergoes rapid maturation during early life, influencing their susceptibility to HIV infection and responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Key aspects include thymic function, cytokine profiles, and the establishment of immune memory, which collectively shape immune responses against HIV. Viral dynamics in HIV-infected infants differ markedly from those in adults, characterized by high viral loads, diverse viral subtypes, and the early establishment of viral reservoirs within immune cells. These reservoirs, particularly in sanctuary sites like the central nervous system, pose challenges for achieving viral eradication and long-term remission. Effective management requires strategies to characterize and target these reservoirs, alongside early intervention to mitigate viral replication and preserve immune function. Advances in viral monitoring technologies and treatment regimens are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing the global burden of pediatric HIV infection.

        <tr id="Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a rare, yet potentially fatal disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) enterotoxins, known as superantigens, which trigger an intense immune response. Our previous study demonstrated the protective effect of tofacitinib against murine toxin-induced shock and a beneficial effect against S. aureus sepsis. In the current study, we examined the effects of tofacitinib on T-cell response in peripheral blood using a mouse model of enterotoxin-induced shock. Our data revealed that tofacitinib suppresses the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. Furthermore, both gene and protein levels of Th1 cytokines were downregulated by tofacitinib treatment in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. Importantly, we demonstrated that CD4+ cells, but not CD8+ cells, are pathogenic in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. In conclusion, our findings suggest that tofacitinib treatment suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation and Th1 response, thereby aiding in protection against staphylococcal toxic shock in mice. This insight may guide the future development of novel therapies for STSS.">

However, certain CD8+ T cells show low reactivity and thus cannot effectively remove tumor cells or viral antigens. Due to this heterogeneity, effective biomarkers representing these differences in CD8+ cells are needed. The identification of suitable biomarkers will also enhance the management of cancer treatment. Recent research has improved the understanding of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment and circulatory system. Treatment efficacy is impacted directly by the pathogenic response of CTLs, and thus, the use of adjuvant therapies to address these pathological changes, e.g., stimulating the increase in the proportion of reactive T cells or suppressing the proportion of terminally exhausted T cells, would be advantageous.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and can be life-threatening. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), adult stem cells with immunomodulatory properties, have been used as therapeutic agents in a variety of ways and have demonstrated efficacy against acute GVHD (aGVHD); however, variability in MSC pro- and anti-inflammatory properties and the limitation that they only exhibit immunosuppressive effects at high levels of inflammation have prevented their widespread clinical use. The outcomes of GVHD treated with MSCs in the clinic have been variable, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, the unique biological effects of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonists led us to compare and validate the efficacy of MSCs primed with KMRC011, a TLR5 agonist. KMRC011 is a stimulant that induces the secretion of cytokines, which play an important role in immune regulation. In this study, we found that MSCs pretreated with KMRC011 increased the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and increased the expression of M2 macrophage polarizing cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in vitro. We investigated the immunosuppressive effects of TLR5 agonist (KMRC011)-primed MSCs on lymphocytes and their preventive and therapeutic effects on an in vivo mouse aGVHD model. In vitro experiments showed that KMRC011-primed MSCs had enhanced immunosuppressive effects on lymphocyte proliferation. In vivo experiments showed that KMRC011-primed MSCs ameliorated GVHD severity in a mouse model of induced GVHD disease. Finally, macrophages harvested from the spleens of mice treated with KMRC011-primed MSCs showed a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Overall, the results suggest that KMRC011-primed MSCs attenuated GVHD severity in mice by polarizing macrophages to the M2 phenotype and increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory cells, opening new horizons for GVHD treatment.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused a global health crisis, necessitating a deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. In this study, we explored the immune and hematological dynamics in COVID-19 patients to gain insights into disease severity and prognosis. Our findings revealed distinct cytokine profiles in moderate and severe cases. IL12A was significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from moderate cases, suggesting a potential role in initiating an effective immune response. Conversely, severe cases exhibited downregulation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL23A, TNFalpha, IL1B, and IFNG) alongside an upregulation of the immunosuppressive IL10, indicative of a dysregulated immune environment. Serum analysis showed elevated IL6 and IL10 levels in both moderate and severe cases, emphasizing their potential as markers for disease severity. Notably, no significant differences in serum cytokines were found between recovery and lethal cases. In lethal cases of COVID-19, elevated D-dimer, urea, and creatinine correlated with IL6 and IL10. This study contributes valuable information to the ongoing efforts to understand and manage the dysregulated immune responses underlying COVID-19 pathology.">

These treatments have marked a pivotal shift in cancer management. However, as “living drugs,” their effectiveness is dependent on their ability to proliferate and persist in patients. Recent studies indicate that the mechanisms regulating these crucial functions, as well as the T cell's differentiation state, are conditioned by metabolic shifts and the distinct utilization of metabolic pathways. These metabolic shifts, conditioned by nutrient availability as well as cell surface expression of metabolite transporters, are coupled to signaling pathways and the epigenetic landscape of the cell, modulating transcriptional, translational, and post‐translational profiles. In this review, we discuss the processes underlying the metabolic remodeling of activated T cells, the impact of a tumor metabolic environment on T cell function, and potential metabolic‐based strategies to enhance T cell immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has converted HIV from a lethal disease to a chronic condition, yet co-morbidities persist. Incomplete immune recovery and chronic immune activation, especially in the gut mucosa, contribute to these complications. Inflammasomes, multi-protein complexes activated by innate immune receptors, appear to play a role in these inflammatory responses. In particular, preliminary data indicate the involvement of IFI16 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in chronic HIV infection. This study explores inflammasome function in monocytes from people with HIV (PWH); 22 ART-treated with suppressed viremia and 17 untreated PWH were compared to 33 HIV-negative donors. Monocytes were primed with LPS and inflammasomes activated with ATP in vitro. IFI16 and NLRP3 mRNA expression were examined in a subset of donors. IFI16 and NLRP3 expression in unstimulated monocytes correlated negatively with CD4 T cell counts in untreated PWH. For IFI16, there was also a positive correlation with viral load. Monocytes from untreated PWH exhibit increased release of IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF compared to treated PWH and HIV-negative donors. However, circulating monocytes in PWH are not pre-primed for inflammasome activation in vivo. The findings suggest a link between IFI16, NLRP3, and HIV progression, emphasizing their potential role in comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. The study provides insights into inflammasome regulation in HIV pathogenesis and its implications for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could "reprogram" intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore T-cell responses.


METHODS
Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.


RESULTS
Intratumoral injection of RRV-IRF8 in mice bearing intracerebral SB28 glioma significantly suppressed the tumor growth and prolonged survival. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Furthermore, DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. In vivo treatment with azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor, showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation, achieving improved tumor control.">

        <tr id="Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a severe complication of influenza infection that occurs in critically ill patients and results in higher mortality compared to influenza infection alone. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) and the Type 17 immune signaling pathway cytokine family are recognized for their pivotal role in fostering protective immunity against various pathogens. In this study, we investigate the role of IL-17 and Type 17 immune signaling components during IAPA. Wild-type mice were challenged with influenza A H1N1 (Flu) and then exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC42202 resting conidia on day 6 post-influenza infection, followed by the quantification of cytokines and chemokines at 48 hours post-fungal infection. Gene and protein expression levels revealed that IL-17 and Type 17 immune cytokines and antimicrobial peptides are downregulated during IAPA compared to mice singularly infected solely with A. fumigatus. Restoration of Type 17 immunity was not sufficient to provide protection against the increased fungal burden observed during IAPA. These findings contrast those observed during post-influenza bacterial super-infection, in which restoration of Type 17 immune signaling protects against exacerbation seen during super-infection. Our study highlights the need for future studies to understand the immune mechanisms that increase susceptibility to fungal infection. Importance IAPA significantly elevates the risk of mortality in patients with severe influenza. Type-17 immunity is critical to host defense during fungal infections and, therefore, vital to understand its role during IAPA. The observations in this study reveal that Type 17 immunity is impaired during IAPA, potentially increasing susceptibility to secondary infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. However, restoration of IL-17 signaling alone is not sufficient to reduce fungal burden in our murine IAPA model. These observations differ from those observed in post-influenza bacterial super-infections, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying viral-fungal super-infection are different than those that underly viral-bacterial super-infection. By elucidating the complex interactions between the host immune system, influenza, and A. fumigatus, these findings are vital for developing strategies to enhance immune responses and improve survival rates during IAPA.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

Evidence suggests that COVID-19 predisposes to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). While monocytes/macrophages play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of atherosclerosis, less is known about their immunopathogenic mechanisms that lead to CVDs during COVID-19. Natural killer (NK) cells, which play an intermediary role during pathologies like atherosclerosis, are dysregulated during COVID-19. Here, we sought to investigate altered immune cells and their associations with CVD risk during severe COVID-19.


METHODS
We measured plasma biomarkers of CVDs and determined phenotypes of circulating immune subsets using spectral flow cytometry. We compared these between patients with severe COVID-19 (severe, n=31), those who recovered from severe COVID-19 (recovered, n=29), and SARS-CoV-2-uninfected controls (controls, n=17). In vivo observations were supported using in vitro assays to highlight possible mechanistic links between dysregulated immune subsets and biomarkers during and after COVID-19. We performed multidimensional analyses of published single-cell transcriptome data of monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19 to substantiate in vivo findings.


RESULTS
During severe COVID-19, we observed alterations in cardiometabolic biomarkers including oxidized-low-density lipoprotein, which showed decreased levels in severe and recovered groups. Severe patients exhibited dysregulated monocyte subsets, including increased frequencies of proinflammatory intermediate monocytes (also observed in the recovered) and decreased nonclassical monocytes. All identified NK-cell subsets in the severe COVID-19 group displayed increased expression of activation and tissue-resident markers, such as CD69. We observed significant correlations between altered immune subsets and plasma oxidized-low-density lipoprotein levels. In vitro assays revealed increased uptake of oxidized-low-density lipoprotein into monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of NK cells activated by plasma of patients with severe COVID-19. Transcriptome analyses confirmed enriched proinflammatory responses and lipid dysregulation associated with epigenetic modifications in monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides new insights into the involvement of monocytes and NK cells in the increased CVD risk observed during and after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract The late 2019 emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, caused profound and unprecedented disruption to the global socio-economic structure, negatively affecting millions of lives worldwide. A typical hallmark of severe COVID-19 is hyper inflammation due to aberrant cytokine release (cytokine storm) by innate immune cells. Recent studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2, through its spike (S) protein, can activate the body’s innate immune cells via Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR4. In silico studies have demonstrated that the S protein binds with high affinity to TLR4, triggering downstream signaling processes that result in pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Compared to other TLRs, such as TLR2, TLR4 plays a more significant role in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, interactions between the virus and target cells can enhance the cellular expression of TLR4, making cells more susceptible to viral interactions and subsequent inflammation. This increased expression of TLR4 upon viral entry creates a feedback loop, where heightened TLR4 levels lead to amplified inflammatory responses, contributing to the severity of the disease. Additionally, TLR4’s potent activation of inflammatory pathways sets it apart from other TLRs, underscoring its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this review, we thoroughly explore the multitude of regulatory signaling pathways that SARS-CoV-2 employs to incite inflammation. We specifically focus on the critical impact of TLR4 activation compared to other TLRs, highlighting how TLR4’s interactions with the viral S protein can exacerbate the severity of COVID-19. By delving into the mechanisms of TLR4-mediated inflammation, we aim to shed light on potential therapeutic targets that could mitigate the inflammatory damage caused by severe COVID-19. Understanding the unique role of TLR4 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection could pave the way for novel treatment strategies that specifically inhibit this receptor’s activity, thereby reducing the overall disease burden and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a multifaceted condition characterized by significant diversity in its molecular and pathological subtypes and clinical manifestation. Despite the progress made in the treatment of DLBCL through the development of novel drugs, an estimated one-third of patients encounter relapse or acquire refractory disease. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of DLBCL, a complex network consisting of cellular and noncellular components that engage in interactions with the tumor, is a parameter that is gaining increasing attention. The TME comprises both the immune and nonimmune microenvironments. The immune microenvironment comprises natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T and B lymphocytes. The nonimmune microenvironment consists of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stromal cells, and other molecules that are secreted. Despite ongoing research, the exact impact of these components and their interaction on the progression of the disease remains elusive. A comprehensive review of significant discoveries concerning the cellular and noncellular constituents, molecular characteristics, and treatment response and prognosis of the TME in DLBCL, as well as the potential targeting of the TME with novel therapeutic approaches, is provided in this article.">

        <tr id="The successful replacement of endogenous tissue-resident macrophages with healthy bone marrow-derived cells through transplantation presents a promising therapeutic approach for treating disease associated with macrophage dysfunction. Our previous development of the novel microglia replacement by bone marrow transplantation (Mr BMT) method achieved high engraftment efficiency in the central nervous system (CNS), overcoming the limitation of traditional bone marrow transplantation (tBMT). In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential impacts of Mr BMT approach on peripheral organs. The Mr BMT approach involves depleting resident microglia through colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibition, so we first evaluated the survival of peripheral macrophages after CSF-1R inhibition. We observed that the CSF-1R antagonist, PLX5622, exerted significant elimination of peripheral tissue macrophages, albeit with lower efficiency than in the CNS. Furthermore, we discovered that Mr BMT achieved replacement efficiencies comparable to tBMT in peripheral tissues such as the liver, kidney, lung, and spleen. Our findings suggested Mr BMT is a highly efficient strategy for allogeneic macrophage replacement in both the CNS and peripheral organs, and it could have potential clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Hepatitis B, caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), often progresses to chronic infection, leading to severe complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HBV infection is characterized by a complex interplay between the virus and the host immune system, resulting in immune cell exhaustion, a phenomenon commonly observed in chronic viral infections and cancer. This state of exhaustion involves elevated levels of inhibitory molecules, cells, and cell surface receptors, as opposed to stimulatory counterparts. This review aims to elucidate the expression patterns of various co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors on immune cells isolated from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. By analyzing existing data, the review conducts comparisons between CHB patients and healthy adults, explores the differences between HBV-specific and total T cells in CHB patients, and examines variations between intrahepatic and peripheral immune cells in CHB patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying immune exhaustion in CHB is crucial for developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches. This detailed analysis sheds light on the immune exhaustion observed in CHB and lays the groundwork for future combined immunotherapy strategies aimed at leveraging checkpoint receptors to restore immune function and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="GMCSF, discovered in 1977, was one of the first growth factors for myelopoiesis. However, over time, it has been found to be redundant for basal myelopoiesis. Rather, its important function seems to be its effect on mature myeloid cells and the immune system. It is produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, endothelial cells, T-cells etc. and works on the GMCSF receptor, which is mainly expressed by mature myeloid cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. It has been found to be an important mediator of at least two autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Animal models prove that GMCSF produced from T-cells play a crucial role in their pathogenesis of both these autoimmune diseases. This has led to the development of therapeutics which target GMCSF or its receptor. Clinical trials have been carried out in rheumatoid arthritis, which have shown modest efficacy. In addition, anti-GMCSF therapy has shown promise in giant cell arteritis.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite infection, is a potentially life-threatening neglected tropical disease with a worldwide distribution. During the chronic phase of the disease, there exists a fragile balance between the host immune response and parasite replication that keeps patients in a clinically-silent asymptomatic stage for years or even decades. However, in 40% of patients, the disease progresses to clinical manifestations mainly affecting and compromising the cardiac system. Treatment is recommended in the chronic phase, although there are no early markers of its effectiveness. The aim of this study is to identify differential expression changes in genes involved in the immune response in antigen-restimulated PBMC from chronic patients with Chagas disease due to benznidazole treatment. Methods Thus, high-throughput real-time qPCR analysis has been performed to simultaneously determine global changes in the expression of 106 genes involved in the immune response in asymptomatic (IND) and early cardiac manifestations (CCC I) Chagas disease patients pre- and post-treatment with benznidazole. Results and discussion The results revealed that 7 out of the 106 analyzed genes were differentially expressed (4 up- and 3 downregulated) after treatment in IND patients and 15 out of 106 (3 up- and 12 downregulated) after treatment of early cardiac Chagas disease patients. Particularly in CCC I patients, regulation of the expression level of some of these genes towards a level similar to that of healthy subjects suggests a beneficial effect of treatment and supports recommendation of benznidazole administration to early cardiac Chagas disease patients. The data obtained also demonstrated that both in asymptomatic patients and in early cardiac chronic patients, after treatment with benznidazole there is a negative regulation of the proinflammatory and cytotoxic responses triggered as a consequence of T. cruzi infection and the persistence of the parasite. This downregulation of the immune response likely prevents marked tissue damage and healing in early cardiac patients, suggesting its positive effect in controlling the pathology.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by the intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, an underreported and emerging global threat. As melioidosis-associated mortality is frequently high despite antibiotics, novel management strategies are critically needed. Therefore, we sought to determine whether functional changes in the host innate and adaptive immune responses are induced during acute melioidosis and are associated with outcome. Using a unique whole blood stimulation assay developed for use in resource-limited settings, we examined induced cellular functional and phenotypic changes in a cohort of patients with bacteremic melioidosis prospectively enrolled within 24 h of positive blood culture and followed for 28 days. Compared to healthy controls, melioidosis survivors generated an IL-17 response mediated by Th17 cells and terminally-differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells (P < .05, both), persisting to 28 days after enrolment. Furthermore, melioidosis survivors developed polyfunctional cytokine production in CD8+ T cells (P < .01). Conversely, a reduction in CCR6+ CD4+ T cells was associated with higher mortality, even after adjustments for severity of illness (P = 0.004). Acute melioidosis was also associated with a profound acute impairment in monocyte function as stimulated cytokine responses were reduced in classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Impaired monocyte cytokine function improved by 28-days after enrolment. These data suggest that IL-17 mediated cellular responses may be contributors to host defense during acute melioidosis, and that innate immune function may be impaired. These insights could provide novel targets for the development of therapies and vaccine targets in this frequently lethal disease.">

        <tr id="Since late 2019, the world has been devastated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with more than 760 million people affected and ∼seven million deaths reported. Although effective treatments for COVID-19 are currently limited, there has been a strong focus on developing new therapeutic approaches to address the morbidity and mortality linked to this disease. An approach that is currently being investigated is the use of exosome-based therapies. Exosomes are small, extracellular vesicles that play a role in many clinical diseases, including viral infections, infected cells release exosomes that can transmit viral components, such as miRNAs and proteins, and can also include receptors for viruses that facilitate viral entry into recipient cells. SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to impact the formation, secretion, and release of exosomes, thereby potentially facilitating or intensifying the transmission of the virus among cells, tissues and individuals. Therefore, designing synthetic exosomes that carry immunomodulatory cargo and antiviral compounds are proposed to be a promising strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 and other viral diseases. Moreover, exosomes generated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) might be employed as cell-free therapeutic agents, as MSC-derived exosomes can diminish the cytokine storm and reverse the suppression of host anti-viral defences associated with COVID-19, and boost the repair of lung damage linked to mitochondrial activity. The present article discusses the significance and roles of exosomes in COVID-19, and explores potential future applications of exosomes in combating this disease. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, exosome-based therapies could represent a promising avenue for improving patient outcomes and reducing the impact of this disease.">

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), pivotal mediators of intercellular communications, build indispensable biological connections between CSCs and immune cells. By transferring bioactive molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, EVs can exert mutual influence on both CSCs and immune cells. This interaction plays a significant role in reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment, creating conditions favorable for the sustenance and propagation of CSCs.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it identified functionally activated neutrophils exhibiting the rTEM phenotype in the lung of a sepsis mouse model using cecal ligation and puncture. The prevalence of neutrophils with the rTEM phenotype is elevated in the blood of patients with sepsis-associated ARDS and is positively correlated with disease severity. Mechanically, scRNA-seq and proteomic analys revealed that inflamed endothelial cell (EC) released extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in karyopherin subunit beta-1 (KPNB1), promoting abluminal-to-luminal neutrophil rTEM. Additionally, EC-derived EVs are elevated and positively correlated with the proportion of rTEM neutrophils in clinical sepsis. Collectively, EC-derived EV is identified as a critical regulator of neutrophil rTEM, providing insights into the contribution of rTEM neutrophils to sepsis-associated lung injury.">

        <tr id="Functional cure for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains challenging due to the lack of direct intervention methods for hepatic inflammation. Multi‐omics research offers a promising approach to understand hepatic inflammation mechanisms in CHB. A Bayesian linear model linked gene expression with clinical parameters, and population‐specific expression analysis (PSEA) refined bulk gene expression into specific cell types across different clinical phases. These models were integrated into our analysis of key factors like inflammatory cells, immune activation, T cell exhaustion, chemokines, receptors, and interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Validation through multi‐immune staining in liver specimens from CHB patients bolstered our findings. In CHB patients, increased gene expression related to immune cell activation and migration was noted. Marker genes of macrophages, T cells, immune‐negative regulators, chemokines, and ISGs showed a positive correlation with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels but not hepatitis B virus DNA levels. The PSEA model confirmed T cells as the source of exhausted regulators, while macrophages primarily contributed to chemokine expression. Upregulated ISGs (ISG20, IFI16, TAP2, GBP1, PSMB9) in the hepatitis phase were associated with T cell and macrophage infiltration and positively correlated with ALT levels. Conversely, another set of ISGs (IFI44, ISG15, IFI44L, IFI6, MX1) mainly expressed by hepatocytes and B cells showed no correlation with ALT levels. Our study presents a multi‐omics analysis integrating bulk transcriptomic, single‐cell sequencing data, and clinical data from CHB patients to decipher the cause of intrahepatic inflammation in CHB. The findings confirm that macrophages secrete chemokines like CCL20, recruiting exhausted T cells into liver tissue; concurrently, hepatocyte innate immunity is suppressed, hindering the antiviral effects of ISGs.">

This study explores the host’s innate and adaptive immune system response to TB in HIV immunocompromised patients, highlighting the significant role of CD8+ T cells. While the crucial role of macrophages and cytokines, like TNF-α and IFN-γ, in managing the host’s immune response to M. tb is examined, the emphasis is on the changes that occur as a result of HIV coinfection. With the progression of HIV infection, the primary source of IFN-γ changes from CD4+ to CD8+ T cells, especially when latent TB advances to an active state. This study sheds light on the necessity of developing new preventative measures such as vaccines and new treatment approaches to TB, especially for immunocompromised patients, who are at a higher risk of life-threatening complications due to TB-HIV coinfection.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex condition of inflammatory and immune dysregulation, triggered by severe infection. In survivors, chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation linger, facilitating the emergence of infections. CD8 dysfunction contributes to immunosuppression in sepsis survivors. We devised an animal model that enabled us to identify and analyze CD8-intrinsic defects induced by sepsis. We adoptively transferred CD45.1 CD8 OT-I T cells into CD45.2 congenic mice and subjected them to cecal ligature and puncture, to induce abdominal sepsis. One month later, we isolated the transferred CD8 cells. Surface marker expression confirmed they had not been activated through the TCR. CD8 OT-I T cells isolated from septic (or sham-operated) mice were transferred to second recipients, which were challenged with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes. We compared effector capacities between OT-I cells exposed to sepsis and control cells. Naive mice that received OT-I cells exposed to sepsis had higher bacterial burden and a shorter survival when challenged with OVA-expressing L. monocytogenes. OT-I cells isolated from septic mice produced less IFN-γ but had conserved activation, expansion potential, and cytotoxic function. We observed lower transcript levels of IFN-γ and of the long noncoding RNA Ifng-as1, a local regulator of the epigenetic landscape, in cells exposed to sepsis. Accordingly, local abundance of a histone modification characteristic of active promoter regions was reduced in sepsis-exposed CD8 T cells. Our results identify a mechanism through which inflammation in the context of sepsis affects CD8 T cell function intrinsically.">

The ability of vertebrate T and B lymphocytes to exhibit classic recall responses has long been regarded as a distinguishing characteristic. However, natural killer (NK) cells have been found to acquire immunological memory in a manner akin to T and B cells. The fundamental principles derived from the investigation of NK cell memory offer novel insights into innate immunity and have the potential to pave the way for innovative strategies to enhance therapeutic interventions against multiple diseases including cancer. Here, we reviewed the fundamental characteristics, memory development and regulatory mechanism of NK cell memory. Moreover, we will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the accomplishments, obstacles, and future direction pertaining to the utilization of NK cell memory in the field of cancer immunotherapy.">

IBD is thought to be primarily caused by an imbalance in immunological barriers, typically demonstrated by a disequilibrium of immune cells with either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory receptors. Despite the well-established efficacy of biological agents (BAs) in treating IBD, which underscores their remarkable therapeutic potential and elucidates their anti-inflammatory mechanisms, the immunomodulatory effects of BAs, particularly on immune balance such as T helper 1/T helper 2 and T helper 17/regulatory T equilibrium, remain to be fully elucidated.

        <tr id="Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are an essential component of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and play key roles in gastrointestinal development, homeostasis, and disease. Derived from neural crest cells, EGCs undergo complex differentiation processes regulated by various signalling pathways. Being among the most dynamic cells of the digestive system, EGCs react to cues in their surrounding microenvironment and communicate with various cell types and systems within the gut. Morphological studies and recent single cell RNA sequencing studies have unveiled heterogeneity among EGC populations with implications for regional functions and roles in diseases. In gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infections and cancer, EGCs modulate neuroplasticity, immune responses and tumorigenesis. Recent evidence suggests that EGCs respond plastically to the microenvironmental cues, adapting their phenotype and functions in disease states and taking on a crucial role. They exhibit molecular abnormalities and alter communication with other intestinal cell types, underscoring their therapeutic potential as targets. This review delves into the multifaceted roles of EGCs, particularly emphasizing their interactions with various cell types in the gut and their significant contributions to gastrointestinal disorders. Understanding the complex roles of EGCs in gastrointestinal physiology and pathology will be crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal disorders.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) mediate host defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and tumors. However, the magnitude of CTL response and their function needed to confer heterosubtypic immunity against influenza virus infection are unknown. We addressed the role of CD8+ T cells in the absence of any cross-reactive antibody responses to influenza viral proteins using an adenoviral vector expressing a 9mer amino acid sequence recognized by CD8+ T cells. Our results indicate that both CD8+ T cell frequency and function are crucial for heterosubtypic immunity. Low morbidity, lower viral lung titers, low to minimal lung pathology, and better survival upon heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with the increased frequency of NP-specific CTLs. NP-CD8+ T cells induced by differential infection doses displayed distinct RNA transcriptome profiles and functional properties. CD8+ T cells induced by a high dose of influenza virus secreted significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and exhibited higher levels of cytotoxic function. The mice that received NP-CD8+ T cells from the high-dose virus recipients through adoptive transfer had lower viral titers following viral challenge than those induced by the low dose of virus, suggesting differential cellular programming by antigen dose. Enhanced NP-CD8+ T-cell functions induced by a higher dose of influenza virus strongly correlated with the increased expression of cellular and metabolic genes, indicating a shift to a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype. These findings have implications for developing effective T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.


IMPORTANCE
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are an important component of the adaptive immune system that clears virus-infected cells or tumor cells. Hence, developing next-generation vaccines that induce or recall CTL responses against cancer and infectious diseases is crucial. However, it is not clear if the frequency, function, or both are essential in conferring protection, as in the case of influenza. In this study, we demonstrate that both CTL frequency and function are crucial for providing heterosubtypic immunity to influenza by utilizing an Ad-viral vector expressing a CD8 epitope only to rule out the role of antibodies, single-cell RNA-seq analysis, as well as adoptive transfer experiments. Our findings have implications for developing T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.">

SOCS1 is the prototypical member of the SOCS family and functions in a classic negative-feedback loop to inhibit signaling in response to interferon, interleukin-12 and interleukin-2 family cytokines. These cytokines have a critical role in orchestrating our immune defence against viral pathogens and cancer. The ability of SOCS1 to limit cytokine signaling positions it as an important immune checkpoint, as evidenced by the detection of detrimental SOCS1 variants in patients with cytokine-driven inflammatory and autoimmune disease. SOCS1 has also emerged as a key checkpoint that restricts anti-tumor immunity, playing both a tumor intrinsic role and impacting the ability of various immune cells to mount an effective anti-tumor response. In this review, we describe the mechanism of SOCS1 action, focusing on the role of SOCS1 in autoimmunity and cancer, and discuss the potential for new SOCS1-directed cancer therapies that could be used to enhance adoptive immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Antibiotic-Refractory Lyme Arthritis (ARLA) involves a complex interplay of T cell responses targeting Borrelia burgdorferi antigens succeeding towards autoantigens by epitope spreading. However, the precise molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenic T cell response in ARLA remain unclear. Our aim was to elucidate the molecular program of disease-specific Th cells.


METHODS
Using flow cytometry, high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and scRNA-seq of CD4+ Th cells isolated from the joints of European ARLA patients, we aimed at inferring antigen specificity through unbiased analysis of TCR repertoire patterns, identifying surrogate markers for disease-specific TCRs and connecting TCR specificity to transcriptional patterns.


RESULTS
PD-1hiHLA-DR+CD4+ effector T cells were clonally expanded within the inflamed joints and persisted throughout disease course. Among these cells, we identified a distinct TCRβ motif restricted to HLA-DRB1*11 or *13 alleles. These alleles, being underrepresented in North American ARLA patients, were unexpectedly prevalent in our European cohort. The identified TCRβ motif served as surrogate marker for a convergent TCR response specific to ARLA, distinguishing it from other rheumatic diseases. In the scRNA-seq dataset, the TCRβ motif particularly mapped to peripheral T helper (TPH) cells displaying signs of sustained proliferation, continuous TCR signaling, and expressing CXCL13 and IFN-γ.


CONCLUSION
By inferring disease-specific TCRs from synovial T cells we identified a convergent TCR response in the joints of ARLA patients that continuously fueled the expansion of TPH cells expressing a pathogenic cytokine effector program. The identified TCRs will aid in uncovering the major antigen targets of the maladaptive immune response.

This review will describe evidence for COVID-19 as a syndrome with a strong, albeit still underestimated, mitochondrial component. Due to the sensitivity of host mitochondria to coronavirus infection, SARS-CoV-2 affects mitochondrial signaling, modulates the immune response, modifies cellular energy metabolism, induces apoptosis and ageing, worsening COVID-19 symptoms which can sometimes be fatal. Various aberrations across human systems and tissues and their relationships with mitochondria were reported. In this review, particular attention is given to characterization of multiple alterations in gene expression pattern and mitochondrial metabolism in COVID-19; the complexity of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial proteins is presented. The participation of mitogenome fragments in cell signaling and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA within membranous compartments, including mitochondria is widely discussed. As SARS-CoV-2 severely affects the quality system of mitochondria, the cellular background for aberrations in mitochondrial dynamics in COVID-19 is additionally characterized. Finally, perspectives on the mitigation of COVID-19 symptoms by affecting mitochondrial biogenesis by numerous compounds and therapeutic treatments are briefly outlined.">

Motivated by recent discoveries that show activation of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling boosts T cell immunity, this study proposes that targeting this pathway can be a strategic approach to identify novel vaccine adjuvants. Consequently, a comprehensive chemical screening of 6,800 small molecules is performed, which results in the discovery of the natural compound picrasidine S (PS) as an IFN-I inducer. Further analysis reveals that PS acts as a powerful adjuvant, significantly enhancing both humoral and cellular immune responses. At the molecular level, PS initiates the activation of the cGAS-IFN-I pathway, leading to an enhanced T cell response. PS vaccination notably increases the population of CD8+ central memory (TCM)-like cells and boosts the CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response. Thus, this study identifies PS as a promising candidate for developing vaccine adjuvants in cancer prevention.">

        <tr id="Innate immune system activation is crucial in the inflammatory response, but uncontrolled activation can lead to autoimmune diseases. Cellular exhaustion and senescence are two processes that contribute to innate immune tolerance breakdown. Exhausted immune cells are unable to respond adequately to specific antigens or stimuli, while senescent cells have impaired DNA replication and metabolic changes. These processes can impair immune system function and disrupt homeostasis, leading to the emergence of autoimmunity. However, the influence of innate immune exhaustion and senescence on autoimmune disorders is not well understood. This review aims to describe the current findings on the role of innate immune exhaustion and senescence in autoimmunity, focusing on the cellular and molecular changes involved in each process. Specifically, the article explores the markers and pathways associated with immune exhaustion, such as PD-1 and TIM-3, and senescence, including Β-galactosidase (β-GAL), lamin B1, and p16ink4a, and their impact on autoimmune diseases, namely type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and immune-mediated myopathies. Understanding the mechanisms underlying innate immune exhaustion and senescence in autoimmunity may provide insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy is a fascinating immunological phenomenon because it allows allogeneic fetal and placental tissues to survive inside the mother. As a component of innate immunity with high inflammatory potential, the complement system must be tightly regulated during pregnancy. Dysregulation of the complement system plays a role in pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Complement components are also used as biomarkers for pregnancy complications. However, the mechanisms of detrimental role of complement in pregnancy is poorly understood. C5a is the most potent anaphylatoxin and generates multiple immune reactions via two transmembrane receptors, C5aR1 and C5aR2. C5aR1 is pro-inflammatory, but the role of C5aR2 remains largely elusive. Interestingly, murine NK cells have been shown to express C5aR2 without the usual co-expression of C5aR1. Furthermore, C5aR2 appears to regulate IFN-γ production by NK cells in vitro. As IFN-γ produced by uterine NK cells is one of the major factors for the successful development of a vital pregnancy, we investigated the role anaphylatoxin C5a and its receptors in the establishment of pregnancy and the regulation of uterine NK cells by examinations of murine C5ar2–/– pregnancies and human placental samples. C5ar2–/– mice have significantly reduced numbers of implantation sites and a maternal C5aR2 deficiency results in increased IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-γ mRNA expression as well as reduced uNK cell infiltration at the maternal-fetal interface. Human decidual leukocytes have similar C5a receptor expression patterns showing clinical relevance. In conclusion, this study identifies C5aR2 as a key contributor to dNK infiltration and pregnancy success.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a key factor in both influenza and radiation-induced lung pathophysiology. This implies a commonality of response to pulmonary damage from these insults and suggests exacerbated pathology may occur after combined exposure. We therefore tested the hypothesis that past inflammation from viral infection alters the lung microenvironment and lowers tolerance for radiation injury. Mice were inoculated with influenza A virus (IAV) and three weeks later, after virus clearance, mice received total-body irradiation (TBI). Survival as well as systemic and local lung inflammation were assessed, and strategies to mitigate pulmonary injury were investigated. After IAV infection alone, body condition recovered within 3 weeks, however inflammatory pathways remained active for 15 weeks. IAV infection exacerbated subsequent TBI responses, evident by increased lethality, enhanced histologically evident lung injury and an altered lung macrophage phenotype. To mitigate this enhanced sensitivity, captopril [an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)] was administered to limit tissue inflammation, or inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment was blocked with a C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) inhibitor. Both treatments abrogated the changes in circulating immune cells observed 4 weeks after TBI, and attenuated pro-inflammatory phenotypes in lung alveolar macrophages, appearing to shift immune cell dynamics towards recovery. Histologically apparent lung injury was not improved by either treatment. We show that latent lung injury from viral infection exacerbates radiation morbidity and mortality. Although strategies that attenuate proinflammatory immune cell phenotypes can normalize macrophage dynamics, this does not fully mitigate lung injury. Recognizing that past viral infections can enhance lung radiosensitivity is of critical importance for patients receiving TBI, as it could increase the incidence of adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains an important global public health problem. About 40 million people are infected with HIV, and this infection caused about 630,000 deaths in 2022. The hallmark of HIV infection is the depletion of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes (Th cells). There are at least seven different Th subtypes, and not all are the main targets of HIV. Moreover, the effect of the virus in a specific subtype can be completely different from that of the others. Although the most compromised Th subtype in HIV infection is Th17, HIV can induce important dysregulations in other subtypes, such as follicular Th (Tfh) cells and regulatory Th cells (Treg cells or Tregs). Several studies have shown that HIV can induce an increase in the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs without causing a significant reduction in their numbers, at least in the early phase of infection. The increased activity of this Th subtype seems to play an important role in determining the immunodeficiency status of HIV-infected patients, and Tregs may represent a new target for innovative anti-HIV therapies, including the so-called “Kick and Kill” therapeutic method whose goal is the complete elimination of the virus and the healing of HIV infection. In this review, we report the most important findings on the effects of HIV on different CD4+ T cell subtypes, the molecular mechanisms by which the virus impairs the functions of these cells, and the implications for new anti-HIV therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Discovered over 4 decades ago in the supernatants of activated T cells, interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses. It is required for effector T cell expansion and differentiation as well as for peripheral tolerance induced by regulatory T cells. High-dose IL-2 treatment was the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, achieving single agent complete and durable responses, albeit only in a small proportion of patients. The therapeutic potential of wild type IL-2 is clinically limited by its short half-life and severe vascular toxicity. Moreover, the activation of regulatory T cells and the terminal differentiation of effector T cells on IL-2 pose additional restrictions. To overcome the toxicity of IL-2 in order to realize its full potential for patients, several novel engineering strategies are being developed and IL-2 based immunotherapy for cancer has emerged as a burgeoning field of clinical and experimental research. In addition, combination of IL-2 with PD-1/L1 pathway blockade shows vastly improved anti-tumor efficacy over either monotherapy in preclinical tumor models. In this review we discuss the biological characteristics of IL-2 and its receptors, as well as its efficacy and treatment limiting toxicities in cancer patients. We also explore the efforts aimed at developing novel and safer IL-2 therapies to harness the full therapeutic potential of this cytokine.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide; annually, approximately 830,000 deaths related to liver cancer are diagnosed globally. Since early-stage HCC is clinically asymptomatic, traditional treatment modalities, including surgical ablation, are usually not applicable or result in recurrence. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), provides new hope for cancer therapy; however, immune evasion mechanisms counteract its efficiency. In addition to viral exposure and alcohol addiction, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a major cause of HCC. Owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance, NASH-associated HCC patients respond much less efficiently to ICB treatment than do patients with other etiologies. In addition, abnormal inflammation contributes to NASH progression and NASH–HCC transition, as well as to HCC immune evasion. Therefore, uncovering the detailed mechanism governing how NASH-associated immune cells contribute to NASH progression would benefit HCC prevention and improve HCC immunotherapy efficiency. In the following review, we focused our attention on summarizing the current knowledge of the role of CD4+T cells in NASH and HCC progression, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies involving the targeting of CD4+T cells for the treatment of NASH and HCC.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor microenvironment (TME) represents the key factor inducing leukemia development. As stromal cells within the leukemia microenvironment, Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BM-MSCs) can trigger leukemia progression under certain conditions. As a critical transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid related factor 2 (Nrf2) can modulate antioxidant response and antioxidant enzyme gene expression, and prevent various oxidative changes. We previously identified a novel mechanism by which Nrf2 promotes leukemia resistance, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of drug-resistant/refractory leukemias. However, the role of Nrf2 in BM-MSCs from B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients has not been clearly reported. The present work focused on investigating the effect of Nrf2 overexpression within MSCs on leukemia cell invasion, extramedullary infiltration and proliferation as well as its downstream pathway. Methods Through clinical sample detection, in vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments, the role of Nrf2 within MSCs within adult B-ALL cell migration and invasion and its potential molecular mechanism was explored through transcriptome sequencing analysis, RT-PCR, Western blot, cell migration, cell invasion, lentivirus transfection and other experiments. Results Nrf2 was highly expressed in BM-MSCs from patients with B-ALL as well as in BM-MSCs co-cultured with leukemia cells. Overexpression of Nrf2 within MSCs significantly promoted leukemia cell migration, invasion and proliferation. The extramedullary organ infiltration rate in B-ALL model mice receiving the combined infusion of both cell types dramatically increased relative to that of leukemia cells alone, accompanied by the significantly shortened survival time. Mechanism study found that Nrf2 overexpression within MSCs promoted PI3K-AKT/ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the downstream pathway by activating SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, ultimately leading to extramedullary infiltration of leukemia cells. Conclusion High Nrf2 expression with in MSCs enhances leukemia cell invasion and migration, which then accelerates infiltration in leukemic extramedullary organs. Targeting Nrf2 or inhibiting its downstream signal molecules may be the effective interventions for B-ALL patients treatment.">

        <tr id="The skin, as the first physical barrier for invading pathogens, also serves as an immunologically active organ. Breaching the skin barrier is thus essential for pathogens to enter the body. The skin contains various immune responsive cells that initiate both the innate and adaptive immune response upon invasion. Activated immune cells help to regulate cytokine response and their differentiation to promote or suppress the crucial immune response against invading pathogens. Human herpes simplex viruses (HHSVs) are the oldest pathogen that can escape immune surveillance of the human host by a well-developed escape mechanism within ganglia, as their evolutionary strategy. In primary infection, a non-specific defense of the host initiates the response against the invading virion. The initial direct antiviral action of the host is regulated by activated macrophages, via the release of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and type-1 interferon (IFN-1). The host-derived cytokines including IFN-12, TNF, and IFN-1 in turn induce natural killer (NK) cells to release IFN-γ. Their positive feedback with synergistic interactions collectively releases nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) against the invading virus. Simultaneously, the combination of cytokines, macrophages, and other cells activates the immune system to eliminate the pathogen. However, the virus has also evolved various mechanisms to counter the host defense strategies. This review will highlight virus-mediated skin infections, especially by HSV, and portray a detailed role of virus-induced cytokines in host-immunity to challenge the invading virion during mucocutaneous HSV infection. Further, this review will discuss the viral-interference on host defense to provide a simplistic overview of the complications of cutaneous HSV infection.">

This was revealed both by detailed analysis of their phenotypical features and gene expression profile and by functional explorations comparing capacity of purified B cells and PCs to suppress T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} secretion ex vivo. Sepsis-induced regulatory PCs exerted their suppressive function on T cells through IL-10 production and increased PD-L1 expression independently of regulatory T cells.

Exploring the differences between single intracranial aneurysm (SIA) and multiple IAs (MIAs) could provide insights for targeted therapies. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and detailed characterization of changes in circulating immune cells in MIAs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with SIA (n = 16) or MIAs (n = 6) were analyzed using high-dimensional mass cytometry to evaluate the frequency and phenotype of immune cell subtypes. A total of 25 cell clusters were identified, revealing that the immune signature of MIAs included cluster changes. Compared to patients with SIA, patients with MIAs exhibited immune dysfunction and regulatory imbalance in T-cell clusters. They also had reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells and their subgroups CD8+ Te and CD8+ Tem cells, as well as reduced numbers of the CD4+ T-cell subgroup CD27-CD4+ Tem cells. Furthermore, compared to SIA, MIAs were associated with enhanced T-cell immune activation, with elevated expression levels of CD3, CD25, CD27, CCR7, GP130, and interleukin 10. This study provides insights into the circulating immune cell profiles in patients with MIAs, highlighting the similarities and differences between patients with SIA and those with MIAs.

        <tr id="While conventional wisdom initially postulated that PD-L1 serves as the inert ligand for PD-1, an emerging body of literature suggests that PD-L1 has cell-intrinsic functions in immune and cancer cells. In line with these studies, here we show that engagement of PD-L1 via cellular ligands or agonistic antibodies, including those used in the clinic, potently inhibits the type I interferon pathway in cancer cells. Hampered type I interferon responses in PD-L1-expressing cancer cells resulted in enhanced efficacy of oncolytic viruses in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, PD-L1 expression marked tumor explants from cancer patients that were best infected by oncolytic viruses. Mechanistically, PD-L1 promoted a metabolic shift characterized by enhanced glycolysis rate that resulted in increased lactate production. In turn, lactate inhibited type I IFN responses. In addition to adding mechanistic insight into PD-L1 intrinsic function, our results will also help guide the numerous ongoing efforts to combine PD-L1 antibodies with oncolytic virotherapy in clinical trials.">

 The regulation of inflammation is a critical aspect of disease tolerance and naturally acquired clinical immunity to malaria. Here, we demonstrate using RNA sequencing and epigenetic landscape profiling by cytometry by Time-Of-Flight (EpiTOF), that the regulation of inflammatory pathways during asymptomatic parasitemia occurs downstream of pathogen sensing—at the epigenetic level. The abundance of certain epigenetic markers (methylation of H3K27 and dimethylation of arginine residues) and decreased prevalence of histone variant H3.3 correlated with suppressed cytokine responses among monocytes of Ugandan children. Such an epigenetic signature was observed across diverse immune cell populations and not only characterized active asymptomatic parasitemia but also correlated with future long-term disease tolerance and clinical immunity when observed in uninfected children. Pseudotime analyses revealed a potential trajectory of epigenetic change that correlated with a child’s age and recent parasite exposure and paralleled the acquisition of clinical immunity. Thus, our data support a model whereby exposure to Plasmodium falciparum induces epigenetic changes that regulate excessive inflammation and contribute to naturally acquired clinical immunity to malaria.">

        <tr id="Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer. CRC has no apparent symptoms in the early stages of disease, and most patients receive a confirmed diagnosis in the middle or late disease stages. The incidence of CRC continues to increase, and the affected population tends to be younger. Therefore, determining how to achieve an early CRC diagnosis and treatment has become a top priority for prolonging patient survival. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of bone marrow-derived immuno-negative regulatory cells that are divided into two subpopulations, polymorphonuclear-MDSCs and monocytic-MDSCs, based on their phenotypic similarities to neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. These cells can inhibit the immune response and promote cancer cell metastasis in the tumour microenvironment (TME). A large aggregation of MDSCs in the TME is often a marker of cancer and a poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases of the intestine (such as colonic adenoma and ulcerative colitis). In the present review, the phenotypic classification of MDSCs in the CRC microenvironment are first discussed. Then, the amplification, role and metastatic mechanism of MDSCs in the CRC TME are described, focusing on genes, gene modifications, proteins and the intestinal micro-environment. Finally, the progress in CRC-targeted therapies that aim to modulate the quantity, function and structure of MDSCs are summarized in the hope of identifying potential screening markers for CRC and improving CRC prognosis and therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a debilitating interstitial lung disease driven by incompletely understood immune mechanisms. Objectives: To elucidate immune aberrations in fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis in single-cell resolution. Methods: Single-cell 5' RNA sequencing was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bronchoalveolar lavage cells obtained from 45 patients with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, 63 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 4 non-fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and 36 healthy controls in the United States and Mexico. Analyses included differential gene expression (Seurat), transcription factor activity imputation (DoRothEA-VIPER), and trajectory analyses (Monocle3/Velocyto-scVelo-CellRank). Measurements and Main Results: Overall, 501,534 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 110 patients and controls and 88,336 bronchoalveolar lavage cells from 19 patients were profiled. Compared to controls, fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis has elevated classical monocytes (adjusted-p=2.5e-3) and are enriched in CCL3hi/CCL4hi and S100Ahi classical monocytes (adjusted-p<2.2e-16). Trajectory analyses demonstrate that S100Ahi classical monocytes differentiate into SPP1hi lung macrophages associated with fibrosis. Compared to both controls and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis patient cells are significantly enriched in GZMhi cytotoxic T cells. These cells exhibit transcription factor activities indicative of TGFβ and TNFα/NFκB pathways. These results are publicly available at https://ildimmunecellatlas.org. Conclusions: Single-cell transcriptomics of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis patients uncovered novel immune perturbations, including previously undescribed increases in GZMhi cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells - reflecting this disease's unique inflammatory T-cell driven nature - as well as increased S100Ahi and CCL3hi/CCL4hi classical monocytes also observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Both cell populations may guide the development of new biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.">

Recent studies have revealed TLR9’s involvement beyond its conventional role in immune response, notably during the tumorigenesis of various cancers such as head and neck, cervical, and ovarian cancers. Here we show that immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated significantly lower TLR9 levels in breast cancer tumors compared to normal breast tissue epithelium. Similarly, TLR9 downregulation was also observed in several transformed breast cancer cell lines versus untransformed breast epithelial cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of TLR9 led to reduced proliferation potential of breast cancer cell associated with activation of senescence as was evident by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, chemokines IL-8 and CXCL1; and growth factor GM-CSF. These findings support TLR9’s regulatory role in mitigating breast cancer and highlight its critical connection between the inflammatory response and tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis is a major global health problem and is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. There is a pressing need for new treatments that circumvent emerging antibiotic resistance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis parasitises macrophages, reprogramming them to establish a niche in which to proliferate, therefore macrophage manipulation is a potential host-directed therapy if druggable molecular targets could be identified. The pseudokinase Tribbles1 (Trib1) regulates multiple innate immune processes and inflammatory profiles making it a potential drug target in infections. Trib1 controls macrophage function, cytokine production, and macrophage polarisation. Despite wide-ranging effects on leukocyte biology, data exploring the roles of Tribbles in infection in vivo are limited. Here, we identify that human Tribbles1 is expressed in monocytes and is upregulated at the transcript level after stimulation with mycobacterial antigen. To investigate the mechanistic roles of Tribbles in the host response to mycobacteria in vivo, we used a zebrafish Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) infection tuberculosis model. Zebrafish Tribbles family members were characterised and shown to have substantial mRNA and protein sequence homology to their human orthologues. trib1 overexpression was host-protective against Mm infection, reducing burden by approximately 50%. Conversely, trib1 knockdown/knockout exhibited increased infection. Mechanistically, trib1 overexpression significantly increased the levels of proinflammatory factors il-1β and nitric oxide. The host-protective effect of trib1 was found to be dependent on the E3 ubiquitin kinase Cop1. These findings highlight the importance of Trib1 and Cop1 as immune regulators during infection in vivo and suggest that enhancing macrophage TRIB1 levels may provide a tractable therapeutic intervention to improve bacterial infection outcomes in tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer (OC) poses a significant global health challenge with high mortality rates, emphasizing the need for improved treatment strategies. The immune system’s role in OC progression and treatment response is increasingly recognized, particularly regarding peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cytokine production. This study aimed to investigate PBMC subpopulations (T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes) and cytokine production, specifically interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), in monocytes of OC patients both preoperatively and during the early postoperative period. Thirteen OC patients and 23 controls were enrolled. Preoperatively, OC patients exhibited changes in PBMC subpopulations, including decreased cytotoxic T cells, increased M2 monocytes, and the disbalance of monocyte cytokine production. These alterations persisted after surgery with subtle additional changes observed in PBMC subpopulations and cytokine expression in monocytes. Considering the pivotal role of these altered cells and cytokines in OC progression, our findings suggest that OC patients experience an enhanced pro-tumorigenic environment, which persists into the early postoperative period. These findings highlight the impact of surgery on the complex interaction between the immune system and OC progression. Further investigation is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms during this early postoperative period, which may hold potential for interventions aimed at improving OC management.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a major global health concern, particularly affecting those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly. CD4+ T cell response is crucial for immunity against M.tb, but chronic infections and aging can lead to T cell exhaustion and senescence, worsening TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction, prevalent in aging and chronic diseases, disrupts cellular metabolism, increases oxidative stress, and impairs T-cell functions. This study investigates the effect of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4+ T cell differentiation and function in aged mouse models and human CD4+ T cells from elderly individuals. Mito-transfer in naïve CD4+ T cells is found to promote protective effector and memory T cell generation during M.tb infection in mice. Additionally, it improves elderly human T cell function by increasing mitochondrial mass and altering cytokine production, thereby reducing markers of exhaustion and senescence. These findings suggest mito-transfer as a novel approach to enhance aged CD4+ T cell functionality, potentially benefiting immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients. This has broader implications for diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T-cell exhaustion and senescence.">

        <tr id="Vaccination against COVID-19 has been pivotal in reducing the global burden of the disease. However, Phase III trial results and observational studies underscore differences in efficacy across vaccine technologies and dosing regimens. Notably, mRNA vaccines have exhibited superior effectiveness compared to Adenovirus (AdV) vaccines, especially with extended dosing intervals. Using in-host mechanistic modelling, this study elucidates these variations and unravels the biological mechanisms shaping the immune responses at the cellular level. We used data on the change in memory B cells, plasmablasts, and antibody titres after the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine for Australian healthcare workers. Alongside this dataset, we constructed a kinetic model of humoral immunity which jointly captured the dynamics of multiple immune markers, and integrated hierarchical effects into this kinetics model, including age, dosing schedule, and vaccine type. Our analysis estimated that mRNA vaccines induced 2.1 times higher memory B cell proliferation than AdV vaccines after adjusting for age, interval between doses and priming dose. Additionally, extending the duration between the second vaccine dose and priming dose beyond 28 days boosted neutralising antibody production per plasmablast concentration by 30%. We also found that antibody responses after the second dose were more persistent when mRNA vaccines were used over AdV vaccines and for longer dosing regimens. Reconstructing in-host kinetics in response to vaccination could help optimise vaccine dosing regimens, improve vaccine efficacy in different population groups, and inform the design of future vaccines for enhanced protection against emerging pathogens.">

Plasma GSN levels are significantly decreased in critical illnesses, including COVID-19, correlating with dysregulated immune responses and poor outcomes. GSN supplementation may mitigate acute lung injury, ARDS, and sepsis, which share pathophysiological features with severe COVID-19, by scavenging actin, modulating cytokine production, enhancing macrophage phagocytosis, and stabilizing the alveolar-capillary barrier. Preliminary data indicate that recombinant human plasma GSN improves oxygenation and lung function in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Although further research is needed to optimize GSN therapy, current evidence supports its potential to mitigate severe consequences of COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

        <tr id="High expression of cellular self‐activated immunosuppressive molecules and extensive infiltration of suppressive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main factors contributing to glioma's resistance to immunotherapy. Nonetheless, technology to modify the expression of glioma cellular self‐molecules through gene editing requires further development. This project advances cell therapy strategies to reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma (TIME). Bone marrow‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are engineered to express bioactive proteins and demonstrate tumor‐homing characteristics upon activation by TGF‐β. These MSCs are designed to secrete the anti‐tumor immune cytokine IL‐12 and the nCD47‐SLAMF7 fusion protein, which regulates T‐cell activity and macrophage phagocytosis. The engineered MSCs are then injected in situ into the glioma site, circumventing the blood‐brain barrier to deliver high local concentrations of bioactive proteins. This approach aims to enhance the M1 polarization of infiltrating macrophages, stimulate macrophage‐mediated tumor cell phagocytosis, activate antigen‐presenting cells, and promote effector CD8+ T cell infiltration, effectively controlling glioma. Additionally, the engineered MSCs may serve as a universal treatment for other tumors that express TGF‐β at high levels. This study proposes a novel treatment strategy for the clinical management of glioma patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Human gliomas are classified using isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status as a prognosticator; however, the influence of genetic differences and treatment effects on ensuing immunity remains unclear.


METHODS
In this study, we used sequential single-cell transcriptomics on 144,678 and spectral cytometry on over two million immune cells encompassing 48 human gliomas to decipher their immune landscape.


RESULTS
We identified 22 distinct immune cell types that contribute to glioma immunity. Specifically, brain-resident microglia (MG) were reduced with a concomitant increase in CD8+ T lymphocytes during glioma recurrence independent of IDH status. In contrast, IDH-wild-type-associated patterns, such as an abundance of antigen-presenting cell-like MG and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, were observed. Beyond elucidating the differences in IDH, relapse, and treatment-associated immunity, we discovered novel inflammatory MG subpopulations expressing granulysin, a cytotoxic peptide, which is otherwise expressed in lymphocytes only. Furthermore, we provide a robust genomic framework for defining macrophage polarization beyond M1/M2 paradigm and reference signatures of glioma-specific tumor immune microenvironment (termed Glio-TIME-36) for deconvoluting transcriptomic datasets.


CONCLUSIONS
This study provides advanced optics of the human pan-glioma immune contexture as a valuable guide for translational and clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) possess unique immunosuppressive activity among CD4-positive T cells. Tregs are ubiquitously present in mammals and function to calm excessive immune responses, thereby suppressing allergies or autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, due to their immunosuppressive function, Tregs are thought to promote cancer progression. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a multicellular system composed of many cell types, including tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Within this environment, Tregs are recruited by chemokines and metabolic factors and impede effective anti-tumor responses. However, in some cases, their presence can also improve patient’s survival rates. Their functional consequences may vary across tumor types, locations, and stages. An in-depth understanding of the precise roles and mechanisms of actions of Treg is crucial for developing effective treatments, emphasizing the need for further investigation and validation. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the complex and multifaceted roles of Tregs within the TME, elucidating cellular communications, signaling pathways, and their impacts on tumor progression and highlighting their potential anti-tumor mechanisms through interactions with functional molecules.">

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, contributing to over a million cancer-related deaths annually. Despite extensive research investigating the genetic factors associated with lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis, few studies have explored genetic predispositions regarding the immune system. This review discusses the most recent genomic findings related to the susceptibility to or protection against lung cancer, patient survival, and therapeutic responses. The results demonstrated the effect of immunogenetic variations in immune system-related genes associated with innate and adaptive immune responses, cytokine, and chemokine secretions, and signaling pathways. These genetic diversities may affect the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression, invasion, and prognosis. Given the considerable variability in the individual immunegenomics profiles, future studies should prioritize large-scale analyses to identify potential genetic variations associated with lung cancer using highthroughput technologies across different populations. This approach will provide further information for predicting response to targeted therapy and promotes the development of new measures for individualized cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="One of the challenges in studying islet inflammation–insulitis–is that it is a transient phenomenon. Traditional reporting of the insulitis progression is based on cumulative, donor-averaged values of leucocyte density in the vicinity of pancreatic islets, that hinder intra- and inter-islet heterogeneity of disease progression. Here, we aimed to understand why insulitis is non-uniform, often with peri-insulitis lesions formed on one side of an islet. To achieve this, we demonstrated the applicability of network theory in detangling intra-islet multi-cellular interactions during insulitis. Specifically, we asked the question “What is unique about regions of the islet that interact with immune cells first”. This study utilized the non-obese diabetic mouse model of type one diabetes and examined the interplay among α-, β-, T-cells, myeloid cells, and macrophages in pancreatic islets during the progression of insulitis. Disease evolution was tracked based on the T/β cell ratio in individual islets. In the early stage, we found that immune cells are preferentially interacting with α-cell-rich regions of an islet. At the islet periphery α-linked β-cells were found to be targeted significantly more compared to those without α-cell neighbors. Additionally, network analysis revealed increased T-myeloid, and T-macrophage interactions with all β-cells.">

        <tr id="Introduction and Objectives: In healthy individuals, activation and expansion of CD8 regulatory T cells (CD8 Treg) leads to selective killing of pathogenic CD4 T cells without broad immunosuppression. In patients with autoimmunity, CD8 Treg appear dysfunctional, allowing pathogenic CD4 T cell expansion and downstream inflammatory events, causing damage to healthy tissues. MTX-101 is a bispecific CD8 Treg modulator targeting CD8 and KIR2DL(1/2/3), co-expressed on CD8 Treg. MTX-101 targets CD8 Treg to restore their function and reduce inflammation without unwanted immune cell activation or global immune suppression. By targeting a root cause of CD4-driven autoimmune diseases, our data suggest that MTX-101 is a promising CD8 Treg-specific therapeutic to restore immune balance for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
 Methods: We evaluated MTX-101 binding, mechanism of action, and specificity in vitro using human PBMCs and in vivo using a human CD4 T cell-driven GVHD model. Pharmacology and early tolerability were evaluated in humanized CD34+-engrafted NSG(IL-15Tg) mice.
 Results: MTX-101 increased the activation and functions of CD8 Treg without activating other immune cells or affecting global immune responses in vitro, and improved outcomes in the acute GVHD model. In Balb/c and humanized mice, MTX-101 pharmacokinetics were consistent with antibody-like molecules. In humanized mice, MTX-101 bound CD8 Treg in peripheral blood and terminal tissues, with no resulting activation of immune cells. No induction of proinflammatory serum cytokines were observed following MTX-101 dosing at concentrations up to 50 mg/kg.
 Conclusion: MTX-101 restores CD8 Treg functions and may provide durable resistance to autoimmune disease progression.

        <tr id="The presence of the HIV-1 reservoir, a group of immune cells that contain intact, integrated, and replication-competent proviruses, is a major challenge to cure HIV-1. HIV-1 reservoir cells are largely unaffected by the cytopathic effects of viruses, antiviral immune responses, or antiretroviral therapy (ART). The HIV-1 reservoir is seeded early during HIV-1 infection and augmented during active viral replication. CD4+ T cells are the primary target for HIV-1 infection, and recent studies suggest that memory T follicular helper cells within the lymph node, more precisely in the B cell follicle, harbor integrated provirus, which contribute to viral rebound upon ART discontinuation. The B cell follicle, more specifically the germinal center, possesses a unique environment because of its distinct property of being partly immune privileged, potentially allowing HIV-1-infected cells within the lymph nodes to be protected from CD8+ T cells. This modified immune response in the germinal center of the follicle is potentially explained by the exclusion of CD8+ T cells and the presence of T regulatory cells at the junction of the follicle and extrafollicular region. The proviral makeup of HIV-1-infected cells is similar in lymph nodes and blood, suggesting trafficking between these compartments. Little is known about the cell-to-cell interactions, microenvironment of HIV-1-infected cells in the follicle, and trafficking between the lymph node follicle and other body compartments. Applying a spatiotemporal approach that integrates genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to investigate the HIV-1 reservoir and its neighboring cells in the lymph node has promising potential for informing HIV-1 cure efforts.">

        <tr id="Autoimmunity refers to an organism’s immune response against its own healthy cells, tissues, or components, potentially leading to irreversible damage to vital organs. Central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms play crucial roles in preventing autoimmunity by eliminating self-reactive T and B cells. The disruption of immunological tolerance, characterized by the failure of these mechanisms, results in the aberrant activation of autoreactive lymphocytes that target self-tissues, culminating in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Genetic predispositions, environmental exposures, and immunoregulatory disturbances synergistically contribute to the susceptibility and initiation of autoimmune pathologies. Within the realm of immune therapies for autoimmune diseases, cytokine therapies have emerged as a specialized strategy, targeting cytokine-mediated regulatory pathways to rectify immunological imbalances. Proinflammatory cytokines are key players in inducing and propagating autoimmune inflammation, highlighting the potential of cytokine therapies in managing autoimmune conditions.

        <tr id="An overly exuberant immune response, characterized by a cytokine storm and uncontrolled inflammation, has been identified as a significant driver of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Consequently, deciphering the intricacies of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 is imperative to identify specific targets for intervention and modulation. With these delicate dynamics in mind, immunomodulatory therapies have emerged as a promising avenue for mitigating the challenges posed by COVID-19. Precision in manipulating immune pathways presents an opportunity to alter the host response, optimizing antiviral defenses while curbing deleterious inflammation. This review article comprehensively analyzes immunomodulatory interventions in managing COVID-19. We explore diverse approaches to mitigating the hyperactive immune response and its impact, from corticosteroids and non-steroidal drugs to targeted biologics, including anti-viral drugs, cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, cell-based therapies (i.e., CAR T, etc.). By summarizing the current evidence, we aim to provide a clear roadmap for clinicians and researchers navigating the complex landscape of immunomodulation in COVID-19 treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Immune evasion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) facilitates intracellular bacterial growth. The mechanisms of immune evasion, however, are still not fully understood. In this study, we reveal that tristetraprolin (TTP), one of the best characterized RNA‐binding proteins controlling the stability of targeted mRNAs, mediates innate immune evasion of mycobacteria. We found that TTP knockout mice displayed reduced bacterial burden in the early stage after Mtb aerosol challenge. Macrophages deficient in TTP also showed an inhibition in intracellular mycobacterial growth. Live mycobacteria induced TTP protein expression in macrophages, which was blocked by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Rapamycin and AZD8055 specifically blocked 4EBP1 phosphorylation in infected macrophages and suppressed intracellular BCG growth. Rapamycin promoted TTP protein degradation through the ubiquitination pathway, whereas the proteasome inhibitor MG‐132 blocked rapamycin function and thus stabilized TTP protein. TTP induction suppressed the expression of iNOS/TNF‐α/IL‐12/IL‐23, and weakened protective immune responses in macrophages, whereas rapamycin enhanced the bactericidal effects through TTP inhibition. Moreover, blocking TTP binding increased the expression of TNF‐α and iNOS and suppressed intracellular mycobacterial growth. Overall, our study reveals a novel role for RNA‐binding protein TTP in Mtb immune evasion mechanisms and provides a potential target for host‐directed therapy against tuberculosis (TB).">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a highly contagious viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a global health threat. The virus enters host cells by binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is then facilitated by the protease activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). It triggers a cytokine storm that eventually leads to cell apoptosis, tissue damage, and organ failure. Therefore, any organs in the human body that have both receptors are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, potentially resulting in multiple-organ failure. The prostate has been reported to express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While there are limited studies regarding the association between COVID-19 and prostatitis, the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could cause prostatitis cannot be denied. Thus, through this review, a better insight into the associations of SAR-CoV-2 can be provided.">

        <tr id="Metabolic reprogramming is a k`ey hallmark of tumors, developed in response to hypoxia and nutrient deficiency during tumor progression. In both cancer and immune cells, there is a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, which then leads to lactate acidification, increased lipid synthesis, and glutaminolysis. This reprogramming facilitates tumor immune evasion and, within the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer and immune cells collaborate to create a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The growing interest in the metabolic reprogramming of the TME, particularly its significance in colorectal cancer (CRC)—one of the most prevalent cancers—has prompted us to explore this topic. CRC exhibits abnormal glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and increased lipid synthesis. Acidosis in CRC cells hampers the activity of anti-tumor immune cells and inhibits the phagocytosis of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), while nutrient deficiency promotes the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. In CRC cells, activation of G-protein coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) signaling leads to overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and reduces the antigen presentation capability of dendritic cells. Moreover, the genetic and epigenetic cell phenotype, along with the microbiota, significantly influence CRC metabolic reprogramming. Activating RAS mutations and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) occur in approximately 50% and 80% of patients, respectively, stimulating glycolysis and increasing levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and MYC proteins. Certain bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which activate CD8+ cells and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, while other mechanisms support pro-tumor activities. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in selected CRC patients has shown promise, and the combination of these with drugs that inhibit aerobic glycolysis is currently being intensively researched to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) in ovarian cancer (OC) has much greater complexity than previously understood. In response to aggressive pro-angiogenic stimulus, blood vessels form rapidly and are dysfunctional, resulting in poor perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and leakiness, which leads to increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). Decreased perfusion and high IFP significantly inhibit the uptake of therapies into the tumor. Within the TME, there are numerous inhibitor cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor association macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete high numbers of immunosuppressive cytokines. This immunosuppressive environment is thought to contribute to the lack of success of immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. This review discusses the components of the TME in OC, how these characteristics impede therapeutic efficacy, and some strategies to alleviate this inhibition.">

        <tr id="Introduction & Objective: Viruses, particularly members of the picornavirus family, are correlated with the onset of T1D. For this reason, viral infection has been identified as an environmental trigger for T1D onset, specifically due to its ability to stimulate the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the islet. The purpose of this study is to define physiological functions of cytokine signaling in β-cells that may contribute to reduced virus-mediated damage and destruction of β-cells.
 Methods: C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice were infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a highly inflammatory picornavirus that causes dysglycemia in genetically susceptible mouse strains. Pancreas and serum were collected from the animals throughout the course of infection. Insulitis and β-cell morphology were evaluated by H&E and immunofluorescence and serum cytokine concentrations were analyzed by LEGENDplex anti-virus response assay. Furthermore, isolated mouse islets were treated with cytokines and gene responses and EMCV viral replication were measured by qRT-PCR.
 Results: We show that C57BL/6J mice are resistant to EMCV infection and maintain islet architecture and glycemic control, despite immune cell infiltration. In contrast, EMCV infection of genetically susceptible DBA/2J mice results in destruction of β-cells, deterioration of islet morphology, and loss of glycemic control. Transiently elevated serum cytokines in C57BL/6J mice suggest successful restriction of EMCV replication whereas sustained elevation of these cytokines in DBA/2J mice suggests a failure of these mice to mount an effective antiviral response. Additionally, islets treated with IL-1β ex-vivo upregulate several antiviral genes and treatment of isolated islets with IL-1β prior to infection attenuates EMCV mRNA accumulation.
 Conclusion: These studies suggest IL-1β signaling in β-cells during viral infection functions to activate protective antiviral defense mechanisms designed to limit β-cell damage.

These include the extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune microenvironment, both of which are integral components of the tumor microenvironment. The present review describes the roles of pancreatic stellate cells, differentiated cancer-associated fibroblasts and the interleukin family, either independently or in combination, in the progression of precursor lesions in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PDAC. These elements contribute to ECM deposition and immunosuppression in PDAC. Therapeutic strategies that integrate interleukin and/or stromal blockade for PDAC immunomodulation and fibrogenesis have yielded inconsistent results. A deeper comprehension of the intricate interplay between fibrosis, and immune responses could pave the way for more effective treatment targets, by elucidating the mechanisms and causes of ECM fibrosis during PDAC progression.">

Spleen pathology begins at the marginal zone (MZ), apparent by 2 d postinfection (dpi), and progresses throughout the red pulp by 4 dpi. To better understand how M.R2k/b mice respond to infection and how Cmv5s contributes to tissue damage in the spleen, we assessed the regulation of myeloid cells and inflammation during acute MCMV infection in MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. We found that Cmv5s drove increased neutrophil accumulation and cell death at the MZ, which corresponded with evidence of localized oxidative stress and increased overall spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 early during infection. Further assessment of MCMV infection dynamics at the early MZ revealed infected SIGNR1+ MZ macrophages as the first apparent cell type lost during infection in these mice and the likely target of early neutrophil recruitment. Spleen macrophages were also identified as the mediators of differential spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 between MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. Interrogation of MCMV progression past 2 dpi revealed substantial M.R2k/b F480+ red pulp macrophage loss along with buildup of oxidative stress and MZ macrophage debris that was not neutrophil dependent. Together we identify Cmv5s-driven macrophage loss and inflammation during acute MCMV infection corresponding with the spatial and temporal development of spleen tissue damage.">

The innate immune response, the host's primary defense against viral infection, plays a pivotal role and has become a breakthrough in research mechanisms. A component of the innate immune system, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are involved in inducing inflammatory responses to viral infections. Numerous DAMPs are released from virally infected cells, activating downstream signaling pathways via internal and external receptors on immune cells. This activation triggers immune responses and helps regulate viral host invasion. This review examines the immune regulatory mechanisms of various DAMPs, such as the S100 protein family, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock proteins, in various viral infections to provide a theoretical basis for designing novel antiviral drugs.">

        <tr id="Various studies have attempted to understand HIV infection under a diverse range of stimulants including cytokine stimulation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, have been shown to reactivate HIV latency by inducing NF-κB mediated activation of the HIV LTR (long terminal repeats) that contain κB transcriptional binding sites. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α), an anti-viral cytokine, is not well studied as an inducer of HIV activation. However, previous work from our group has shown that HIV can block IFN-α signaling in CD4+ T cells presumably to allow for further viral replication. Initially using HEK 293T cells, we moved to CD4+ T cells lines to develop a system to determine how stimulation with different cytokines impacts signaling within T cell lines. We confirmed that in our system TNF-α triggers activation of NF-κB driven reporters but not in the presence of HIV. In addition, we show that the presence of HIV blocks IFN-α signaling. Taken together, our system demonstrates that HIV by TNF-α, will continue to block IFN-α signaling preventing it from impacting HIV activation. This system can now be used to screen for cytokine based and other molecule activators that may be influenced by the presence of HIV.">

        <tr id="Gut mucosal immunity in infants exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) presents a complex interplay of developmental processes, viral dynamics, and therapeutic interventions that significantly impact clinical outcomes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms, clinical implications, and therapeutic strategies concerning gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants. The gut mucosa serves as a critical site for immune maturation and defense against pathogens, but HIV infection disrupts this delicate balance, leading to compromised immune function and increased susceptibility to infections.  Infants born to HIV-positive mothers experience unique challenges in gut mucosal immunity due to vertical transmission of the virus and exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV infection disrupts gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), resulting in early depletion of CD4+ T cells and compromised mucosal barrier function. These alterations contribute to microbial translocation, chronic inflammation, and immune dysregulation, impacting overall immune competence and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Despite advances in ART, persistent immune activation and residual gut mucosal damage pose ongoing challenges in achieving optimal immune reconstitution and preventing long-term complications in HIV-exposed infants. Clinical implications of compromised gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants extend beyond gastrointestinal health to encompass systemic immune dysfunction and increased risks of non-AIDS comorbidities. Impaired gut barrier function exacerbates microbial translocation, leading to systemic inflammation that may contribute to neurodevelopmental abnormalities and metabolic disorders.

        <tr id="Modest response rates to immunotherapy observed in advanced lung cancer patients underscore the need to identify reliable biomarkers and targets, enhancing both treatment decision-making and efficacy. Factors such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden, and a ‘hot’ tumor microenvironment with heightened effector T cell infiltration have consistently been associated with positive responses. In contrast, the predictive role of the abundantly present tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell (TIMs) fraction remains somewhat uncertain, partly explained by their towering variety in terms of ontogeny, phenotype, location, and function. Nevertheless, numerous preclinical and clinical studies established a clear link between lung cancer progression and alterations in intra- and extramedullary hematopoiesis, leading to emergency myelopoiesis at the expense of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lymphoid differentiation. These observations affirm that a continuous crosstalk between solid cancers such as lung cancer and the bone marrow niche (BMN) must take place. However, the BMN, encompassing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, differentiated immune and stromal cells, remains inadequately explored in solid cancer patients. Subsequently, no clear consensus has been reached on the exact breadth of tumor installed hematopoiesis perturbing cues nor their predictive power for immunotherapy. As the current era of single-cell omics is reshaping our understanding of the hematopoietic process and the subcluster landscape of lung TIMs, we aim to present an updated overview of the hierarchical differentiation process of TIMs within the BMN of solid cancer bearing subjects. Our comprehensive overview underscores that lung cancer should be regarded as a systemic disease in which the cues governing the lung tumor-BMN crosstalk might bolster the definition of new biomarkers and druggable targets, potentially mitigating the high attrition rate of leading immunotherapies for NSCLC.">

        <tr id="To investigate how host and pathogen diversity govern immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), we performed a large-scale screen of vaccine-mediated protection against aerosol Mtb infection using three inbred mouse strains [C57BL/6 (B6), C3HeB/FeJ (C3H), Balb/c x 129/SvJ (C129F1)] and three Mtb strains (H37Rv, CDC1551, SA161) representing two lineages and distinct virulence properties. We compared three protective modalities, all of which involve inoculation with live mycobacteria: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only approved TB vaccine, delivered either subcutaneously or intravenously, and concomitant Mtb infection (CoMtb), a model of pre-existing immunity in which a low-level Mtb infection is established in the cervical lymph node following intradermal inoculation. We examined lung bacterial burdens at early (Day 28) and late (Day 98) time points after aerosol Mtb challenge and histopathology at Day 98. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the reduction of bacterial load afforded by these modalities at Day 28 across the combinations and noted a strong positive correlation between bacterial burden in unvaccinated mice and the degree of protection afforded by vaccination. Although we observed variation in the degree of reduction in bacterial burdens across the nine mouse/bacterium strain combinations, virtually all protective modalities performed similarly for a given strain-strain combination. We also noted dramatic variation in histopathology changes driven by both host and bacterial genetic backgrounds. Vaccination improved pathology scores for all infections except CDC1551. However, the most dramatic impact of vaccination on lesion development occurred for the C3H-SA161 combination, where vaccination entirely abrogated the development of the large necrotic lesions that arise in unvaccinated mice. In conclusion, we find that substantial TB heterogeneity can be recapitulated by introducing variability in both host and bacterial genetics, resulting in changes in vaccine-mediated protection as measured both by bacterial burden as well as histopathology. These differences can be harnessed in future studies to identify immune correlates of vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections cause thymic involution yet the potential for broader, longer-term impact on thymic composition remains unexplored. Here we show that chronic, but not acute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection promotes a unique population of immature B cells in the thymus. We show that chronic viral infection promotes signals within the thymus, including the expression of B-cell activating factor (BAFF), that favor the maturation of this population as these cells acquire expression of CD19 and immunoglobulin M. Mechanistically, type I interferon (IFN-I), predominantly IFNβ, signals to thymic hematopoietic cells, strongly delaying T-cell development at the earliest precursor stage. Furthermore, IFN-I signaling to the nonhematopoietic compartment provides a second signal essential to favor B-cell differentiation and maturation within the thymus. Importantly, chronic infection yields changes in the B-cell population for at least 50 days following infection, long after thymic atrophy has subsided. Thus, the inflammatory milieu induced by chronic viral infection has a profound, and long-lasting, effect on thymic composition leading to the generation of a novel population of thymic B cells.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Dendritic cells are important mediators in the activation of the innate and adoptive immune response. The generation of DC/DCleu was comparable under physiological hypoxic and normoxic culture conditions, with no significant differences in frequencies of generated DC/DCleu from leukemic cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear as well as whole blood cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, the composition of immune cells and anti-leukemic immune activity after T cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture with patients’ blood pretreated vs not pretreated with defined response modifiers (Kits) was improved, particularly under hypoxic conditions. These data show that the generation of DC/DCleu as well as the induction of anti-leukemic immune activating functionality is possible under standard normoxic as well as physiological hypoxic culture conditions ex vivo. Abstract Hypoxia can modulate the immune system by affecting the function and activity of immune cells, potentially leading to altered immune responses. This study investigated the generation of leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DCleu) from leukemic blasts and their impact on immune cell activation under hypoxic (5–10% O2) compared to normoxic (21% O2) conditions using various immunomodulatory Kits. The results revealed that DC/DCleu-generation was similar under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, with no significant differences observed in frequencies of generated DC/DCleu. Furthermore, the study showed that the activation of immune cells and their anti-leukemic activity improved when T cell-enriched immunoreactive cells were co-cultured with DC/DCleu which were generated with Kit I and M compared to the control after mixed lymphocyte cultures. The anti-leukemic activity was improved under hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions after MLCWB-DC Kit M. These findings suggest that DC/DCleu-cultures of leukemic whole blood with Kits under hypoxic conditions yield comparable frequencies of DC/DCleu and can even increase the anti-leukemic activity compared to normoxic conditions. Overall, this research highlights the potential of utilizing DC/DCleu (potentially induced in vivo with Kits) as a promising approach to enhance immune response in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.">

This knowledge gap has hindered the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome tumor immune resistance induced by hypoxia.

A hypoxic microenvironment promotes binding of HIF-1α complex is demonstrated to the ALCAM promoter therefore increasing its expression in macrophages, and the ALCAMhigh macrophages co-localize with exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor spatial microenvironment and promote T cell exhaustion. Preclinically, HIF-1ɑ inhibition reduces ALCAM expression in macrophages and exhausted CD8+ T cells and potentiates T cell antitumor function to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. This study reveals the systematic landscape of hypoxia at single-cell resolution and spatial architecture and highlights the effect of hypoxia on immunotherapy resistance through the ALCAMhigh macrophage-exhausted T cell axis, providing a novel immunotherapeutic strategy to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance in cancers.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of chromatin DNA studded with granule proteins, are released by neutrophils in response to both infectious and sterile inflammation. Beyond the canonical role in defense against pathogens, the extrusion of NETs also contributes to the initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic response of malignant diseases. Recently, NETs have been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumors. Although extensive work regarding inflammation in tumors has been reported, a comprehensive summary of how these web‐like extracellular structures initiate and propagate tumor progression under the specific microenvironment is lacking. In this review, we demonstrate the initiators and related signaling pathways that trigger NETs formation in cancers. Additionally, this review will outline the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of NETs during dormant cancer cells awakening, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) extravasation, and metastatic recurrence of cancer. This is followed by a perspective on the current and potential clinical potential of NETs as therapeutic targets in the treatment of both local and metastatic disease, including the improvement of the efficacy of existing therapies.">

        <tr id="Conventionally, immune responses are studied in the context of inflamed tissues and their corresponding draining lymph nodes (LNs). However, little is known about the effects of systemic inflammatory signals generated during local inflammation on distal tissues and nondraining LNs. Using a mouse model of cutaneous immunization, we found that systemic inflammatory stimuli triggered a rapid and selective distal response in the small intestine and the mesenteric LN (mesLN). This consisted of increased permeability of intestinal blood vessels and lymphatic drainage of bloodborne solutes into the mesLN, enhanced activation and migration of intestinal dendritic cells, as well as amplified T cell responses in the mesLNs to systemic but not orally derived Ags. Mechanistically, we found that the small intestine endothelial cells preferentially expressed molecules involved in TNF-α signaling and that TNF-α blockade markedly diminished distal intestinal responses to cutaneous immunization. Together, these findings reveal that the intestinal immune system is rapidly and selectively activated in response to inflammatory cues regardless of their origin, thus identifying an additional layer of defense and enhanced surveillance of a key barrier organ at constant risk of pathogen encounter.">

        <tr id="While many studies have associated HIV prevalence with socio-economic status, few have explored the host's immunity status prior to HIV infection. High HIV prevalence in Africa may in part be contributed by a high prevalence of other persistent infections that modulate the host immunity towards phenotypes that promote HIV acquisition. In this narrative review, we examined how four most prevalent pathogens in Africa (human papillomavirus, herpesviruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and helminth infections) modulate immunity to favor their survival and in turn, also influence HIV acquisition. We have described how these pathogens expand the number of memory and activated T cells, increase the expression of HIV entry receptors leading to an increased HIV susceptibility, and show how these pathogens' immunoevasive strategies may favor HIV persistence. A better understanding of the association between immunomodulation caused by other prevalent infections and HIV/AIDS prevalence may improve HIV/AIDS preventive strategies in Africa. We suggest intensifying efforts to control these chronic infections by making drugs or vaccines available in endemic regions. This may act as another indirect strategy to complement current HIV/AIDS interventions in Africa. We also call for more research to understand better the relationship between immunomodulation by other prevalent infections and HIV incidence.

Those living with uncontrolled HIV and low CD4 T cell counts might develop a fulminant clinical mpox course with increased mortality, secondary infections, and necrotizing lesions. Fatal cases display a high and widespread MPXV tissue burden. The underlying pathomechanisms are not fully understood. We report here the pathological findings of an MPXV-driven abscess in gastrocnemius muscle requiring surgery in an immunocompromised patient with severe mpox. Presence of virus particles and infectivity were confirmed by electron microscopy, expansion microscopy, and virus culture, respectively. MPXV tissue distribution by immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed a necrotic core with infection of different cell types. In contrast, at the lesion rim fibroblasts were mainly infected. Immune cells were almost absent in the necrotic core, but were abundant at the infection rim and predominantly macrophages. Further, we detected high amounts of alternatively activated GPNMB+-macrophages at the lesion border. Of note, macrophages only rarely colocalized with virus-infected cells. Insufficient clearance of infected cells and infection of lesion-associated fibroblasts sustained by the abundance of profibrotic macrophages might lead to the coalescing of lesions and the severe and persistent clinical mpox course observed in immunocompromised patients.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature cells that expand in the circulation of patients with cancer, sepsis or chronic inflammation, modulate the immune response against cancer (favoring tumor onset and progression) and promote neoangiogenesis. These premises suggest that MDSCs could be involved in the pathogenesis of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by chronic inflammation and extensive neoangiogenesis in bone marrow and spleen). In this paper, we found that (1) MDSCs are increased both in the circulation and in the spleen of PMF patients and strongly correlate with disease progression; and (2) reduced CXCR4 expression on MDSCs along with increased plasmatic SDF-1α can be involved in their mobilization. These findings suggest that circulating MDSCs can be considered a parameter of disease severity and set MDSCs as potential new targets for cancer therapy. Abstract Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a chronic inflammatory state that plays a relevant role in the disease pathogenesis (as proven by high levels of inflammatory cytokines with prognostic significance and by a persistent oxidative stress) and by extensive neoangiogenesis in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature cells that expand in patients with cancer, sepsis or chronic inflammation, favoring tumor onset and progression mainly through the decrease in immune surveillance and the promotion of neoangiogenesis. In this paper, we evaluated the presence of circulating MDSCs in PMF patients, the plasmatic factors involved in their mobilization/expansion and the correlations with laboratory, genetic and clinical parameters. The data indicated that MDSCs could have a relevant role in PMF as a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to explaining the phenotypic diversity observed during the clinical course of the disease, or a potential new target for personalized treatment.">

        <tr id="Rationale: CD8+ T cells undergo a series of metabolic reprogramming processes during their activation and proliferation, including increased glycolysis, decreased aerobic oxidation of sugars, increased amino acid metabolism and increased protein synthesis. However, it is still unclear what factors regulate these metabolic reprogramming processes in CD8+ T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment. Methods: T cell chromobox protein 4 (CBX4) knock-out mice models were used to determine the role of CBX4 in CD8+ T cells on the tumor immune microenvironment and tumor progression. Flow cytometry, Cut-Tag qPCR, Chip-seq, immunoprecipitation, metabolite detection, lentivirus infection and adoptive T cells transfer were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms of CBX4 knock-out in promoting CD8+ T cell activation and inhibiting tumor growth. Results: We found that CBX4 expression was induced in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and inhibited CD8+ T cell function by regulating glucose metabolism in tumor tissue. Mechanistically, CBX4 increases the expression of the metabolism-associated molecule aldolase B (Aldob) through sumoylation of trans-acting transcription factor 1 (SP1) and Krüppel-like factor 3 (KLF3). In addition, Aldob inhibits glycolysis and ATP synthesis in T cells by reducing the phosphorylation of the serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt) and ultimately suppresses CD8+ T cell function. Significantly, knocking out CBX4 may improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy by enhancing the function of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Conclusion: CBX4 is involved in CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and functional persistence in tumor tissues, and serves as an inhibitor in CD8+ T cells' glycolysis and effector function.">

        <tr id="The generation and maintenance of memory T cells are regulated by various factors, including cytokines. Previous studies have shown that IL-27 is produced during the early acute phase of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS (Pcc) infection and inhibits the development of Th1-type memory CD4+ T cells. However, whether IL-27 acts directly on its receptor on Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells or indirectly via its receptor on other immune cells remains unclear. We aimed to determine the role of IL-27 receptor signaling in different immune cell types in regulating the generation and phenotype of memory CD4+ T cells during Plasmodium infection. We utilized Plasmodium-specific TCR transgenic mice, PbT-II, and Il27rα-/- mice to assess the direct and indirect effects of IL-27 signaling on memory CD4+ T-cell generation. Mice were transferred with PbT-II or Il27rα-/- PbT-II cells and infected with Pcc. Conditional knockout mice lacking the IL-27 receptor in T cells or dendritic cells were employed to discern the specific immune cell types involved in IL-27 receptor signaling. High levels of memory in PbT-II cells with Th1-shift occurred only when both PbT-II and host cells lacked the IL-27 receptor, suggesting the predominant inhibitory role of IL-27 signaling in both cell types. Furthermore, IL-27 receptor signaling in T cells limited the number of memory CD4+ T cells, while signaling in both T and dendritic cells contributed to the Th1 dominance of memory CD4+ T cells. These findings underscore the complex cytokine signaling network regulating memory CD4+ T cells during Plasmodium infection.">

The liver's specific anatomical and physiological features expose it to various antigens, requiring precise immune regulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a comprehensive overview of the interactions between the immune system and gut microbiota in the development of HCC, as well as the relevant therapeutic approaches are discussed. Dysregulation of immune compartments within the liver microenvironment drives HCC pathogenesis, characterized by elevated regulatory cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and M2 macrophages as well as suppressive molecules, alongside reduced number of effector cells like T cells, natural killer cells, and M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota also contributes to HCC by disrupting intestinal barrier integrity and triggering overactivated immune responses. Immunotherapy approaches, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, have exhibited promise in HCC management, yet adoptive cell therapy and cancer vaccination research are in the early steps with relatively less favorable outcomes. Further understanding of immune dysregulation, gut microbiota involvement, and therapeutic combination strategies are essential for advancing precision immunotherapy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium representing one of the leading causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The development of pneumonia results from a complex interplay between pathogens and pulmonary innate mucosal immunity. Therefore, the knowledge of the host immune responses is pivotal for the development of effective therapeutics to treat A. baumannii infections. Previous studies were conducted using cell lines and animal models, but a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between A. baumannii and primary human immune cells is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we investigated the response of primary monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells to the A. baumannii-type strain and an epidemic clinical isolate. We found that all immune cells trigger different responses when interacting with A. baumannii. In particular, macrophages and monocytes mediate bacterial clearance, whereas monocytes and dendritic cells activate a late response through the production of cytokines, chemokines, and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. The epidemic strain induces lower expression of interleukin-10 and CD80 compared with the type strain, potentially constituting two immune evasion strategies.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint proteins have become recent research hotspots for their vital role in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and suppressing immune response function in a wide range of tumors. Therefore, investigating the immunomodulatory functions of immune checkpoints and their therapeutic potential for clinical use is of paramount importance. The immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is an important component of cancer immunotherapy, as it targets inhibitory immune signaling transduction with antagonistic antibodies to restore the host immune response. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies are two main types of widely used ICBs that drastically improve the survival and prognosis of many patients with cancer. Nevertheless, the response rate of most cancer types remains relatively low due to the drug resistance of ICBs, which calls for an in-depth exploration to improve their efficacy. Accumulating evidence suggests that immune checkpoint proteins are glycosylated in forms of N-glycosylation, core fucosylation, or sialylation, which affect multiple biological functions of proteins such as protein biosynthesis, stability, and interaction. In this review, we give a brief introduction to several immune checkpoints and summarize primary molecular mechanisms that modulate protein stability and immunosuppressive function. In addition, newly developed methods targeting glycosylation on immune checkpoints for detection used to stratify patients, as well as small-molecule agents disrupting receptor–ligand interactions to circumvent drug resistance of traditional ICBs, in order to increase the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy strategies of patients with cancer, are also included to provide new insights into scientific research and clinical treatments.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune cell dysfunction plays a central role in sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. Targeted treatment using healthy donor immune cell transfusions, particularly granulocyte concentrates (GC) potentially induces tissue damage. Initial trials using GC in an extracorporeal immune cell perfusion system provided evidence for beneficial effects with fewer side effects, by separating patient and donor immune cell compartments. A multicenter clinical trial is exploring feasibility and effects of a 6-h treatment (NCT06143137). This ex vivo study examines technical feasibility and cellular effects of an extended treatment interval up to 24 h.


METHODS
Standard GC were purified to increase the potential storage time and subsequently implemented in the extracorporeal immune cell perfusion system. Parameters assessed included cell viability, phagocytosis activity, oxidative burst, cytokine release, and metabolic parameters of purified. GC during an extended circulation time of up to 24 h.


RESULTS
After storage of 72 h granulocytes were viable throughout the study period and exhibited preserved functionality and metabolic activity. The findings highlight a time-dependent nature of cytokine release by neutrophils in the extracorporeal circuit, as cytokine secretion patterns showed IL-8 peaking within 6 h, while MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α increased after 24 h of circulation.


CONCLUSION
Purified GC remain functional after 72 h of storage and additional 24 h in the circulating treatment model. Cytokine secretion patterns revealed a significant increase, especially between 10 and 24 h of treatment. Extending treatment time holds promise for enhancing immune response against sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing immune-targeted therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Obesity is a chronic disease caused by the accumulation of excessive adipose tissue. This disorder is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which promotes the release of proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines and leptin. Simultaneously, chronic inflammation can predispose to cancer development, progression and metastasis. Proinflammatory molecules are involved in the recruitment of specific cell populations in the tumor microenvironment. These cell populations include myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous, immature myeloid population with immunosuppressive abilities. Obesity-associated MDSCs have been linked with tumor dissemination, progression and poor clinical outcomes. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to assess the impact of obesity-associated MDSCs on cancer in both preclinical models and oncological patients with obesity. A secondary objective was to examine the key role that leptin, the most important proinflammatory mediator released by adipocytes, plays in MDSC-driven immunosuppression Finally, an overview is provided of the different therapeutic approaches available to target MDSCs in the context of obesity-related cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor‐driven immune suppression is a critical mechanism by which cancer cells evade the host immune system, leading to tumor growth and metastasis. The tumor immune microenvironment contains a large population of immune‐suppressing myeloid cells, which play a key role in tumor development and drug resistance to existing immunotherapy. Polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (PMN‐MDSCs) are important components of the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of PMN‐MDSCs and finding specific targets for PMN‐MDSCs to regulate tumor immune microenvironment is the focus and challenge of current immunotherapy. In a recent issue of Nature, Wang and colleagues revealed that CD300ld on PMN‐MDSCs is required for tumor‐driven immune suppression(1), this provided a new target for cancer immunotherapy, The study identified CD300ld as a novel, highly conserved tumor immunosuppressive receptor. CD300ld is highly expressed specifically on PMN‐MDSCs and is a key receptor in regulating the recruitment and immunosuppressant function of PMN‐MDSCs. Targeting CD300ld can reshape the tumor immune microenvironment by inhibiting the recruitment and function of PMN‐MDSCs, resulting in broad‐spectrum anti‐tumor effects. CD300ld target shows good safety, conservation, anti‐tumor effectiveness, and synergism with the Programmed death‐1 target, which is expected to become a new ideal target for tumor immunotherapy.">

 Monoclonal antibodies are among the most effective treatments for patients with blood cancers, and they primarily function by marking cells for destruction by the innate immune system. Macrophages are critical innate effectors of antibody therapies for lymphoma, but their anti-tumor capacity is limited by the CD47/SIRPa interaction. CD47 acts a “don’t eat me” signal that is highly expressed on the surface of many lymphomas, and it prevents phagocytosis by binding to the inhibitory receptor SIRPa expressed on macrophages. In multiple clinical trials, CD47-blocking therapies have demonstrated encouraging signs of efficacy for B-cell lymphomas, particularly when used in combination with rituximab, an opsonizing anti-CD20 antibody. However, the best antibodies and combination strategies to activate macrophages remains unknown. Here, we sought to define the repertoire of cell surface antigens that can be targeted to stimulate macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphomas. To achieve this goal, we developed a high-throughput functional screening platform to measure the ability of primary macrophages to attack B-cell lymphoma cells. We successfully applied this system to screen monoclonal antibody libraries targeting hundreds of distinct cell surface antigens across both mouse and human systems. We conducted screens using each antibody as a single agent, in combination with anti-CD20, or in combination with anti-CD47. From these efforts, we identified CD24, CD38, CXCR4, CD71, and multiple other novel and unique antigens that could be targeted alone or in combination to exert maximal macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphoma. Of note, some of the identified targets are predominantly expressed by the lymphoma cells, whereas others are expressed by the macrophages and act as unappreciated immune checkpoints. In validation studies, we defined a multitude of new antibody combinations that robustly stimulate macrophages to attack and eliminate lymphoma cells. Since some anti-CD47-antibodies have been limited by on-target hematologic toxicity, we also used the identified targets to engineer a collection of novel bispecific antibodies that induce macrophage phagocytosis without causing hematologic toxicity. We generated 156 bispecific antibodies, produced them recombinantly, and demonstrated they can maximize macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity of human B-cell lymphoma cells while minimizing binding to healthy blood cells. In mouse xenograft models, these bispecific antibodies exhibited significant single-agent activity in a model of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Thus, our study has led to the development of a multitude of novel therapeutic candidates and combination strategies that can be developed further to maximize anti-tumor function and benefit patients with lymphoma. Furthermore, our approach can be rapidly applied to other hematologic malignancies to create innovative bispecific agents that maximize anti-tumor responses by macrophages or other innate immune cells.

        <tr id="Macrophages, as important immune cells of the organism, are involved in maintaining intrahepatic microenvironmental homeostasis and can undergo rapid phenotypic changes in the injured or recovering liver. In recent years, the crucial role of macrophage-programmed cell death in the development and regression of liver diseases has become a research hotspot. Moreover, macrophage-targeted therapeutic strategies are emerging in both preclinical and clinical studies. Given the macrophages’ vital role in complex organismal environments, there is tremendous academic interest in developing novel therapeutic strategies that target these cells. This review provides an overview of the characteristics and interactions between macrophage polarization, programmed cell death, related biomarkers, and macrophage-targeted therapies. It aims to deepen the understanding of macrophage immunomodulation and molecular mechanisms and to provide a basis for the treatment of macrophage-associated liver diseases.">

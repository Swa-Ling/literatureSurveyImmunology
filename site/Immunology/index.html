        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The gut microbiota crucially regulates the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear at the single-cell resolution. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent validations, we investigate gut microbiota-ICI synergy by profiling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and elucidating critical cellular interactions in mouse models. Our findings reveal that intact gut microbiota combined with ICIs may synergistically increase the proportions of CD8+, CD4+, and γδ T cells, reduce glycolysis metabolism, and reverse exhausted CD8+ T cells into memory/effector CD8+ T cells, enhancing antitumor response. This synergistic effect also induces macrophage reprogramming from M2 protumor Spp1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to Cd74+ TAMs, which act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These macrophage subtypes show a negative correlation within tumors, particularly during fecal microbiota transplantation. Depleting Spp1+ TAMs in Spp1 conditional knockout mice boosts ICI efficacy and T cell infiltration, regardless of gut microbiota status, suggesting a potential upstream role of the gut microbiota and highlighting the crucial negative impact of Spp1+ TAMs during macrophage reprogramming on immunotherapy outcomes. Mechanistically, we propose a γδ T cell-APC-CD8+ T cell axis, where gut microbiota and ICIs enhance Cd40lg expression on γδ T cells, activating Cd40 overexpressing APCs (e.g., Cd74+ TAMs) through CD40-CD40L-related NF-κB signaling and boosting CD8+ T cell responses via CD86-CD28 interactions. These findings highlight the potential importance of γδ T cells and SPP1-related macrophage reprogramming in activating CD8+ T cells, as well as the synergistic effect of gut microbiota and ICIs in immunotherapy through modulating the TME.">

        <tr id="Preserving barrier integrity is of great importance in mucosal tissues while simultaneously defending against inflammatory threats and exposures to pathogens. NK cells at barrier sites are essential for viral control during infections such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but must also balance pathogen response with tissue protection. We have characterized human tissue NK cells in the vaginal tissue (VT) as having distinct effector and tissue protective functions. Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection. Our data, using both human tissues and a mouse model, reveal an unexpected role of mucosal tissue NK cells in the VT in balancing host protection with tissue repair in the context of localized mucosal tissue infection.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="Background. Immunotherapy is efficacious in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the benefits are limited to a minority of patients. Most HCC patients show resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), potent immune stimulators, showed limited effectiveness. Using preclinical models, we studied the mechanisms of resistance to ICB and STING agonism. Methods. Murine HCA-1 and RIL-175 HCCs were orthotopically grown in mice with underlying liver fibrosis, to mimic the presentation of human HCC. Established tumors were treated with a STING agonist (BMS-986301) or anti-PD1 ICB, and mice were followed to evaluate safety and efficacy, as well as the mechanisms of treatment resistance by RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, B-cell depletion and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) ICB. Results. Unbiased analyses of transcriptomic data from murine HCC tissues from ICB-treated mice showed an increased abundance of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and B cells. STING agonism alone showed efficacy in the ICB-responsive RIL-175 HCC model but more limited efficacy in the ICB-resistant HCA-1 model. STING agonism increased circulating IL-10 and intratumoral infiltration by B-cells, including TIM-1+ B cells, and promoted the formation of tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS)-like structures, especially in the peritumoral areas. Strikingly, adding B cell depletion to ICB or STING agonism treatment significantly increased survival. Interestingly, unlike ICB, STING agonism also had a pronounced anti-metastatic activity. In addition, the combination of STING agonism and TIM-1 blockade augmented B cell differentiation and antigen presentation in vitro and improved the anti-tumor effects in murine HCC in vivo. This approach decreased the number of TIM-1+ B cells in the tumor and shifted B cells to higher expression of CD86 and MHC class II, enhancing the antigen presentation capability and further boosting the antitumor efficacy of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that B cells are associated with ICB- and STING-mediated therapy resistance, and that depleting B-cells or targeting TIM-1 enhances both innate and acquired therapeutic efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are a granulocytic population of myeloid cells that have critical effector functions during infectious disease but are generally thought to be short-lived and nonproliferative with markedly limited activation states. In these studies, we directly compared lung neutrophil activation following infection with different groups of pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and helminths. Our results demonstrate considerable heterogeneity depending on the type of infectious agent. In contrast to bacterial and fungal infection, after helminth infection neutrophils expressed markers associated with characteristic type 2 responses and unexpectedly upregulated genes associated with cell cycling and protein synthesis. Further studies showed reduced neutrophil cell death following helminth infection and increased proliferation, which was dependent on IL-4R signaling. This distinct subset of proliferating neutrophils expanded following helminth infection and was released from the endothelial niche to colocalize with invading parasites in the airways. These studies demonstrate a novel long-lived cycling phenotype for neutrophils following helminth infection.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in immunotherapy, metastatic melanoma remains a considerable therapeutic challenge due to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. Intratumoral type I interferon (IFN-I) has long been associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, several IFN-I subtypes can also paradoxically promote tumor growth in some contexts. We investigated this further by engineering murine B16 melanoma cells to overexpress various IFN-I subtypes, where a spectrum of outcomes was observed. Characterization of these tumors by RNA sequencing revealed a tumor immune phenotype, where potent IFN-I signaling concomitant with diminished type 2 inflammation failed to confer durable tumor control. T cell–mediated rejection of these tumors was restored by introducing interleukin-4 (IL-4) into the tumor microenvironment, either through ectopic expression or in a preclinical adoptive T cell therapy model. Collectively, our findings highlight the IFN-I/IL-4 axis in promoting antitumor immunity, which could be harnessed to target and stratify solid tumors that are nonresponsive to frontline therapies.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cell (Treg) heterogeneity exists in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but we have limited understanding of context-dependent functions and spatiotemporal regulators of heterogenous Treg states, especially during perinatal life when immune tolerance is established. Here, we revealed that the class III PI3K Vps34 orchestrates effector Treg (eTreg) transitional heterogeneity during perinatal life. We found that loss of Vps34 reduced terminal eTreg accumulation in lymphoid tissues, associated with decreased Treg generation in non-lymphoid tissues and development of an early-onset autoimmune-like disease. After perinatal life, Vps34-deficient eTreg accumulation was further impaired due to reduced cell survival, highlighting temporal regulation of eTreg heterogeneity and maintenance by Vps34. Accordingly, inhibition of Vps34 in mature Tregs disrupted immune homeostasis but boosted anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, multiomics profiling approaches uncovered that Vps34-orchestrated transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling promotes terminal eTreg programming. Further, via genetic deletion of the Vps34-interacting proteins Atg14 or Uvrag in Tregs, we established that Atg14 but not Uvrag was required for the overall survival, but not terminal differentiation, of eTregs, suggesting that autophagy but not endocytosis partly contributed to Vps34-dependent effects. Accordingly, mice with Treg-specific loss of Atg14, but not Uvrag, had moderately disrupted immune homeostasis and reduced tumor growth, with Vps34- or Atg14-dependent gene signatures also being elevated in intratumoral Tregs from human cancer patients. Collectively, our study reveals distinct Vps34-orchestrated signaling events that regulate eTreg heterogeneity and functional adaptation and the pathophysiological consequences on autoimmunity versus anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8+ T cells are pivotal for long-term anti-tumor immunity due to their longevity and rapid response upon encountering tumor cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a member of the Ste20 family of kinases, restricts proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and plays critical roles in T cell priming and activation. However, the impact of HPK1 on CD8+ T cell differentiation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells derived from patients lacking HPK1 exhibit a stronger memory phenotype. HPK1 deletion promotes the formation of precursor and central memory CD8+ T cells, resulting in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity in murine cancer models compared to WT mice. Additionally, HPK1 knockout induces metabolic reprogramming by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration complex activity. Mechanistically, HPK1 deletion downregulates mTOR signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6. Increased mitophagy activity is observed in HPK1-depleted cells, with upregulation of key mitophagy regulators, including Pink1 and Bnip3l, maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our study reveals that HPK1 regulates CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming, guiding cell differentiation and antitumor responses.">

Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo.

        <tr id="Background Arginine methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are crucial modulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses, and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages is critical in shaping the TME. Despite ongoing clinical trials of small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 for cancer therapy, their effects on macrophages, a key component of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Methods A pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis was initially conducted to investigate the expression of PRMT5 in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 in mice, as well as the use of a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, was performed to evaluate the impact of PRMT5 on macrophage polarization and tumor progression. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics were employed to explore the mechanistic roles of PRMT5 in regulating lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy was assessed to study its effects on antitumor immunity in vivo. Results The pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the PPARG-macrophage subset, which correlates with poor patient survival. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 reprogrammed macrophages towards an antitumor phenotype, effectively inhibiting tumor progression. Mechanistically, PRMT5 was found to regulate lipid metabolism and drive macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state via the STAT6-PPARγ pathway, fostering an immunosuppressive TME conducive to tumor growth. Notably, Prmt5 deletion induced PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy, demonstrating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Conclusions These findings uncover a crucial role for PRMT5 in macrophage biology and suggest that targeting PRMT5 in myeloid cells offers a promising new approach for cancer immunotherapy. The combination of PRMT5 inhibition with anti-PD-L1 therapy may provide a potent strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Background Myocarditis is a common inflammatory heart disease in children and young adults, with fulminant myocarditis (FM) being the most severe form due to its rapid onset and high mortality rate. However, the precise pathological immune subsets and molecular change in myocarditis, particularly FM, remain unknown. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of pediatric peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the acute and recovery phases of FM. A viral myocarditis (MC) mouse model was established using CVB3. Deletion and adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells, as well as blockade of CXCR4, were conducted in vivo. CD8+T cells were sorted and cultivated in vitro, then stimulated with CXCL12 and CXCR4 antagonists to investigate the mechanism of CD8+T cell overactivation. Results CD8+T cells show significant activation, amplification, enhanced cytotoxicity, and increased chemotactic ability in FM. Deletion of CD8+T cells alleviates myocardial injury and improves cardiac function in MC mice, while adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells from MC mice aggravates myocardial inflammation and injury. The transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated CXCR4 expression in CD8+T cells in acute FM. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis drives the overactivation and cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells. In vivo treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist effectively reduces CD8+T cell accumulation in the heart, alleviates myocardial inflammation, and improves cardiac function in MC mice. Conclusions These findings provide deeper insights into the immune landscape of pediatric FM, uncovering a novel role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in driving CD8+T cell responses in myocarditis.

        <tr id="The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The immune system plays a crucial role in either fighting or supporting tumor growth. In this study, we analyzed immune cells in control skins and skin tumors using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 15 different immune cell types and observed significant changes in their composition during skin tumor progression. Macrophages became the dominant immune cells in tumors and acted as key regulators of immune interactions, while other immune cells, including Langerhans cells and DETC, decreased. We also found that tumors activated specific signaling pathways, including Jak2/Stat3, and increased immune-suppressing cells like Tregs and M2 macrophages. These changes help tumors evade the immune system. Our findings provide new insights into how the immune system responds to skin tumor progression and may help guide future treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="The current concept is that the eye is an immune privileged site endowed with innate immune regulatory networks to maintain organ function. We now have evidence that resident T cells occupy intraocular tissues. In immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, tissue resident T cells trigger disease flares in the skin and joints. This suggests resident T cells in the uvea may have similar functions in non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis, a collective term for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the uveal tract causing intraocular inflammation. Here, we demonstrate by spectral cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging that non-inflamed uveal tissue contains multiple T cell subtypes including CD8+ CD103+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. Using single cell RNA & T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile aqueous humour cells from donors with acute, active uveitis, we identify clonally expanded T cells which are enriched for TRM -associated genes. We further show that in donors with active uveitis, CD8+ CD103+ T cells persist within tissue in the uveal tract. Using bulk RNA sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) we show that quiescent iris tissue from donors with a history of uveitis are enriched for genes associated with T cell activation and antigen presentation. Finally, we demonstrate that TRM cells persist in the anterior uvea in mice following resolution of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Our results show that the human eye contains T cells both in health and during active inflammation. Our findings challenge the dogma that the eye is devoid of lymphocytes and supports the concept of resident T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis and as promising targets for therapy.

        <tr id="Neonates, especially those born prematurely, are highly vulnerable to infection-induced mortality. Numerous observational and immunological studies in newborns have shown that live attenuated vaccines have beneficial, non-specific effects (NSEs) against secondary infections to unrelated pathogens. These beneficial effects have been attributed to trained immunity, and emergency granulopoiesis plays an essential role. However, trained immunity has been shown to affect multiple myeloid subsets and how trained immunity influences the host protective response is still undefined. Here we show that Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis by simultaneously reprogramming broad aspects of myelopoiesis. Specifically, BCG vaccination expands multiple myeloid subsets, including the lineage (Lin)−Sca- 1+c-kit+ (LSK) and granulocytic-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and increases CD11b+Gr1+ cell number, as well as their oxidative metabolism and capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation in response to sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of neonatal splenocytes suggests that BCG-vaccination changes the broad transcriptional landscape of multiple myeloid subsets. The result is the maturation of various neutrophil and monocyte subsets, stimulation of antimicrobial processes, and suppression of inflammatory pathways and myeloid-derived suppressor cell transcription. These findings reveal that BCG administration early after birth fundamentally reorganizes the myeloid landscape to benefit the subsequent response to polymicrobial infection.

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as key immune components of the TME, play a pivotal role in tumor progression by fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Programmed death 1 (PD-1), a critical immune checkpoint molecule predominantly expressed on T cells, mediates immune suppression by binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Emerging evidence reveals that TAMs also express PD-1, however, the expression and functional regulatory mechanisms of PD-1 on TAM remain poorly understood. Methods In this study, we combined bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to investigate the association between PD-1 expression on macrophages and patient prognosis, while also uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which PD-1 regulates macrophage function. To further investigate the role of PD-1 in macrophage activity, we established a fluorescence-labeled tumor-bearing mouse model using CT26 cells, a murine colorectal cancer cell line, to evaluate the relationship between PD-1 expression on TAMs and their phagocytic activity as well as other functions. Additionally, to mimic the TME in vitro, we cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with CT26-conditioned medium (CT26-CM). Results Our results suggest that PD-1 expression on TAMs drives macrophage polarization toward an M2-like phenotype, suppresses their phagocytic activity, inhibits the synthesis of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling molecules, and ultimately promotes tumor progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PD-1 regulates the synthesis of IFN-γ signaling molecules and the polarization of M2-type macrophages in BMDMs through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Overall, our study demonstrates that PD-1 expression on TAMs facilitates the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, ultimately accelerating tumor progression.

        <tr id="Attempts to activate an anti-tumor immune response in glioblastoma (GBM) have been met with many challenges due to its inherently immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The degree and mechanisms by which molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this state are poorly defined. In this study, our multifaceted approach combining bioinformatics analyses of clinical and experimental datasets, single-cell sequencing, and the molecular and pharmacologic manipulation of patient-derived cells identified GSCs expressing immunosuppressive effectors mimicking regulatory T cells (Tregs). We showed that this immunosuppressive Treg-like (ITL) GSC state is specific to the mesenchymal GSC subset and is associated with and driven specifically by TGFβ type II receptor (TGFBR2) in contrast to TGFBR1. Transgenic TGFBR2 expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres promoted a mesenchymal transition and induced a six-gene ITL signature consisting of CD274 (PD-L1), NT5E (CD73), ENTPD1 (CD39), LGALS1 (galectin-1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), and TGFB1. This TGFBR2-driven ITL signature was identified in clinical GBM specimens, patient-derived GSCs, and systemic mesenchymal malignancies. TGFBR2high GSCs inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T cell viability and their capacity to kill GBM cells, effects reversed by pharmacologic and shRNA-based TGFBR2 inhibition. Collectively, our data identify an immunosuppressive GSC state that is TGFBR2-dependent and susceptible to TGFBR2-targeted therapeutics.">

TIM3 is markedly expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), and the inconsistent research findings on its role in myeloid cells underscore its vital function within DCs. Through the establishment of an in vitro differentiation model generating mature dendritic cells (mDCs) under TIM3-targeted interventions, combined with an RNA sequencing analysis, this investigation systematically examined TIM3-mediated regulation and ligand interactions in human primary DCs. The findings indicate that TIM3 inhibition hinders DC maturation, which subsequently diminishes the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, ultimately leading to immune suppression in T cells. These findings collectively establish TIM3 as a regulator of DC differentiation that promotes DC maturation while optimizing the antigen-processing and presentation capacity. This study elucidates the rationale behind the suboptimal efficacy of TIM3 inhibitors and advocates for retaining TIM3 signaling pathways in DCs.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, systemic Treg depletion is not favored due to the crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a key chemokine receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating Tregs and targeted blockade of CCR8 exerts anticancer effect in several cancer types, but whether this pathway is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods We determined the involvement of CCR8+ Tregs in HCC using human HCC tissues and TCGA database, and examined the anticancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CCR8 antagonist, IPG0521m, which was developed in house, in murine liver cancer model with flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and Real-Time PCR. Results Remarkable increase in CCR8+ Tregs was observed in human HCC tissues. Treatment of syngeneic liver cancer model with IPG0521m resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, associated with increased CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis indicated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in remarkable increase in antitumor immunity. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in a switch of Tregs from high immunosuppression to low immunosuppression phenotype, associated with elevated CD8+ T and NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor tissues. Conclusions IPG0521m inhibited liver cancer growth via reducing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs, thereby boosting anti-cancer immunity. Our study paves the way for the clinical study of CCR8 antagonist in HCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have substantially improved the lives of people with HIV (PWH) and reduced HIV acquisition through pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, the long-term effect of ART on the physiological state of cells remains poorly understood. Despite the success of ART in preventing the progression of HIV infection to AIDS, PWH are suffering from a disproportional burden of non-AIDS comorbidities, including lung diseases. Given the central function of alveolar macrophages (AM) in pulmonary immunity, we evaluated the impact of time on ART on AM of PWH and people on PrEP. Employing a retrospective cross-sectional design, we showed that ART imprinted a pro-inflammatory and senescence-like epigenetic and transcriptomic state on AM. This effect of ART was detected irrespective of HIV infection. Increased epigenetic priming and gene expression of cell cycle arrest markers such as CDKN1A (p21), senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes, e.g. IL6R and CXCL8, and transcription factors subunits of the AP-1 family were a hallmark of ART exposure. The ART-linked epigenetic and transcriptomic changes were strongly dependent on the duration of ART for both the PWH and PrEP groups and consistent with dysregulated AM function. SASP contributes to the pathophysiology of multiple lung diseases such as COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma. Combined, our data suggested that long-term ART contributes to age-related pulmonary comorbidities in PWH. Given the strong correlation with time on ART and adverse effects in PWH, it is possible that long-term PrEP may result in similar clinical outcomes. While PrEP is critically important for preventing HIV acquisition in the most vulnerable populations, our study advocates for adjuvant therapies and improved drug design to prevent or mitigate potential long-term adverse effects of PrEP.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and, despite treatment advances, immune suppression remains an obstacle to effective therapy. Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common leukemia in adults, exhibits immune escape characteristics like solid tumors. The expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a well-recognized immune checkpoint, has been detected in AML blast cells and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Although an imbalance of B cell subpopulations exists in AML patients’ bone marrow microenvironment, the role of B cells and their interaction with IDO1 in AML have yet to be elucidated. Herein, with bioinformatic analysis, we found the close correlations between IDO1 expression and survival and B cell subpopulation proportions in AML patients. Further, our investigation into IDO1 expression and activity, B cell subpopulation proportions and immunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10) level in AML cells and clinical samples revealed significant findings. Using a co-culture system of healthy human PBMCs and AML cell lines, we demonstrated that high IDO1 expression in AML cells could alter the proportions of total B, regulatory B and memory B cells, and increased the level of IL-10. Finally, with the IDO1 inhibitor RY103 designed by our laboratory, we found that IDO1 inhibition had good anti-leukemic effect and restored the abnormal proportions of B cell subpopulations in AML mice. Our study is the first to reveal the modulation of IDO1 on B cell subpopulations in AML, making a significant breakthrough in understanding the immune escape mechanisms of AML. Application of IDO1 inhibitor, such as RY103, targeting the imbalance of B cell subpopulations can lead to innovative treatments for AML.

        <tr id="Transplant recipients require lifelong, multimodal immunosuppression to prevent rejection by reducing alloreactive immunity. Rapamycin, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is known to modulate adaptive and innate immunity, while the full spectrum of its immunosuppressive mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Given the broad expression of mTOR, we investigated the understudied effects of rapamycin on lymph node (LN) architecture, leukocyte trafficking, and the gut microbiome and metabolism after 3, 7, and 30 days of rapamycin treatment, to characterize the early, intermediate, and late changes. Rapamycin significantly reduced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral LNs, mesenteric LNs, and the spleen over time. Rapamycin induced early pro-inflammation transition to pro-tolerogenic status, by modulating the LN laminin α4:α5 expression ratios through LN stromal cells laminin α5 expression and by adjusting Treg numbers and distribution. Additionally, rapamycin significantly altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic functions, shifting the Bacteroides to Firmicutes ratio and increasing amino acid bioavailability in the gut lumen. These effects were evident by 7 days and became most pronounced by 30 days in naïve mice, with notable changes as early as 3 days in allogeneic splenocyte-stimulated mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapamycin’s action through time-dependent modulation of LN architecture and gut microbiome, which orchestrates changes in immune cell trafficking, providing a new framework for understanding and optimizing immunosuppressive therapies.">

CD8+TRM derived from cervical tissue were more efficient at eliminating reactivated HIV-infected CD4+T cells compared to circulating effector CD8+T cells. Expansion of CD8+TRM-like phenotypes from blood through IL-15/TGF-β1 stimulation recovered functional HIV-specific CD8+T cells displaying residency features, increased clonotypic diversity and mitochondrial function, and were the most efficient phenotypes at eliminating intact viruses after reactivation.

        <tr id="Abstract Objective: Chronic HBV infection disproportionately affects people living with HIV, who are often excluded from functional cure studies. This study investigates CD8+ T cell profiles in HBV mono-infection versus HBV/HIV co-infection, examining the impact of long-term therapy on virus-specific responses with the goal of informing therapeutic strategies for immune restoration. Design: We analysed CD8+ T cell responses in 61 participants (HBV n=20, HBV/HIV n=20, HIV n=21), on suppressive antiviral therapy. We assessed transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, focusing on exhaustion markers alongside virus-specific functional capabilities. Results: Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct signature in co-infection, with upregulation of genes associated with TCR signaling, inhibitory pathways and progenitor-exhausted markers (XCL2, TCF7, PDCD1, IL7R). This gene profile scored highly for a precursor exhausted (Tpex) CD8+ T cell signature, reflecting a "stemness" programme that maintains plasticity despite chronic antigen exposure. Proteomic analysis confirmed higher frequencies of precursor exhausted TCF-1+CD127+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in co-infection, while HBV mono-infection showed predominance of terminally exhausted ToxhighTCF-1-CD127- cells. These differences correlated with more robust, polyfunctional HBV-specific responses in co-infection against surface and core antigens. Lower HBsAg levels and longer treatment duration in co-infection associated positively with Tpex populations and functional responses and inversely with terminal exhaustion. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that individuals with well-controlled HBV/HIV co-infection maintain more robust CD8+ T cell responses with preserved stem-like properties supporting ongoing antiviral function. These results underscore the benefits of early antiretroviral intervention and the need for tailored immune-modulatory therapies to restore antiviral functionality in these diverse patient populations.">

        <tr id="Background: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and holds great potential for them, including metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, immune resistance remains a major obstacle, limiting its efficacy and durability. Understanding the mechanisms of immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is pivotal for overcoming these challenges and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Methods: Over 2000 samples, including a real-world cohort of 230 advanced ccRCC patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) were analyzed. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from 13 tumor regions were categorized into ICB-exposed, ICB-resistant, and ICB-responsive groups. Multiple robust algorithms and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to explore TME composition and macrophage heterogeneity. Spatial communication dynamics were further investigated. In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of SPP1 on 786-O and 769-P cells. Co-culture experiments with THP-1-derived macrophages, followed by Western blot, flow cytometry, and functional assays, were performed to investigate SPP1-mediated macrophage polarization and its impact on tumor progression. Results: The results revealed an elevated presence of Apolipoprotein E (APOE)+ macrophages in ICB-resistant ccRCC. Notably, higher APOE+ macrophage proportion indicated shorter prognosis and worse response to ICB (P < 0.001). Elevated expression of CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Delta (CEBPD) was markedly linked to several immunosuppressive pathways, hindering T cell recruitment, promoting exhaustion, ultimately diminishing poorer prognosis and worse ICB efficacy. Meanwhile, upregulated Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) significantly enhances the proliferation, clonal formation, and migration of ccRCC cells. Tumor-derived SPP1. Additionally, SPP1 signaling from malignant cells appeared to recruit APOE+ macrophages to tumor margins, and promotes macrophage polarization into APOE+ M2-like macrophages. In the vicinity of the tumor, these APOE+ macrophages shape immunosuppressive TME by releasing abundant TGF-β signals, limiting anti-tumor effector T cells activity in ICB-resistant tumors, and contributing to tumor progression. Conclusion: This study reveals the critical role of APOE+ macrophages in promoting immune suppression and resistance to ICB therapy in ccRCC. By promoting T cell exhaustion and immunosuppressive signaling, particularly via localized TGF-β, these spatially segregated macrophages undermine treatment efficacy. Targeting APOE+ macrophages, especially in conjunction with ICB, presents a promising strategy to overcome immune resistance and enhance outcomes for ccRCC patients.">

        <tr id="Background Adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is now a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for melanoma. While this is a major milestone, there is room for improvement to increase clinical response rates and to further optimize the manufacturing of TIL products. In this study, we characterized the association of tumor-infiltrating B-cells (TIL-B) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) with clinical response to TIL therapy and tested whether the presence of B-cells in the tumor can be leveraged to optimize TIL manufacture. Methods Tumor sections from TIL responders (R, n=9) and non-responders (NR, n=11) were analyzed by RNA sequencing, and immune cell content was estimated in silico. To study the association between B-cells and TIL expansion, we quantified B-cell subsets and TIL phenotype by flow cytometry. CD40L-induced effects on melanoma-infiltrating B-cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and scRNA-sequencing. Results Tumors from TIL clinical responders had greater abundance of class-switched B-cells (p=0.007) and a greater TLS score (p=0.03) than those of NRs. In addition, greater abundance of B-cells (p≤0.05) and switched memory B-cells (CD27+ IgD−, p≤0.05) in the tumors were associated with greater TIL expansion. Stimulation of TIL-B through addition of CD40L during TIL ex vivo culture improved their expansion success rate from 33% to 67% (p=0.03). Similarly, the addition of CD40L to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) TIL cultures shortened the manufacturing period by 1 week. Moreover, CD40L-enhanced TIL showed more stem-like T-cells (CD39− CD69−, p≤0.05) and an enrichment of neoantigen-reactive T-cell clones in NSCLC TIL. Gene expression analysis showed that CD40L induced gene expression changes in TIL-B after 48 hours in culture (126 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)), with minimal to no changes observed in other immune cell types (including 12 DEG in macrophages, 10 DEG in dendritic cells, and none in monocytes). B-cell DEGs included upregulated co-stimulatory ligands (CD83, CD58), chemokines (CCL22, CCL17), among others. CD40L-induced upregulation of CD58 by melanoma infiltrating B-cells was associated with successful TIL expansion. Conclusions Our results show that CD40L-stimulated B-cells can be leveraged to enhance the quality and quantity of TIL.

        <tr id="Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="In solid tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex mix of tumor, immune, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a fraction of immune cells that may infiltrate into the TME. The primary function of these T-cells is to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME primarily mediated by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as the tumor cells themselves, T-cells fail to differentiate into effector cells or become dysfunctional and are unable to eliminate the tumor. In addition, chronic antigen stimulation within the TME also leads to a phenomenon, first identified in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, where the T-cells become exhausted and lose their effector functions. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) are characterized by the presence of remarkably conserved inhibitory receptors, transcription and signaling factors and the downregulation of key effector molecules. Tex cells have been identified in various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. Recent studies have indicated novel strategies to reverse T-cell exhaustion. These include checkpoint inhibitor blockade targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), or combinations of different immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) or combination of ICTs with cytokine co-stimulation. In this review, we discuss aspects of T-cell dysfunction within the TME with a focus on T-cell exhaustion. We believe that gaining insight into the mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion within the TME of human solid tumors will pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to target and potentially re-invigorate exhausted T-cells in cancer.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated metabolism of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment leads to immune evasion and tumor progression. As a major cell component in the tumor, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2hi TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (Tregs) to TH17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.">

        <tr id="Previous studies have demonstrated the significant impact of NK cells on adaptive immune responses against chlamydial infections through modulating DCs, yet the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of NK cells in modulating DC signaling pathways and the recruitment of DCs during Chlamydia muridarum infection. Transcriptomic analyses revealed significant downregulation of key genes in DCs from NK-depleted mice involved in type I immunity, including IL12rb2, IL-18rap, and chemokine signaling components such as Ccl3, Ccl5, and Ccr5. Gene ontology (GO) analyses confirmed impaired chemokine–chemokine receptor interactions in DCs from NK-depleted mice. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis showed that NK-cell depletion reduced CCR5 expression on splenic and pulmonary DCs, impairing their migration toward CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, IFN-γ enhanced CCR5 expression on the surface of DCs, consequently promoting their migration, which was blocked by anti-IFN-γ antibodies. In vitro migration assays showed that treatment of DCs with IFN-γ increased their responsiveness to CCL3 and CCL5, the ligands of CCR5. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the indispensable role of NK cells in orchestrating DC signaling and the recruitment of DCs during chlamydial infection.">

        <tr id="Tumor dissemination is a key event in tumor progression. During this event, a main role is played by circulating tumor cells (CTCs), immune cells, and their interaction. How the immune system supports the survival and proliferation of CTCs is not fully elucidated. In this study we established an in-vitro co-culture system consisting of immune cells and CTCs from the same patient, which increased the success rate in the establishment of CTC-derived long-term cell cultures. In this system, we characterized the immune cells of successful co-cultures and the signals they exchange with cancer cells, including cytokines and extracellular vesicle (EV) content. Using this protocol, we stabilized four CTC-derived cell lines from patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer, which were cultured for over a year and characterized from a genetic and molecular point of view. The four cell lines harbor shared chromosomal aberrations including the amplification at 8q24.21 containing MYC and deletion 9p21.3 containing CDKN2A/B and the IFN type I cluster. The transcriptomic profile of CTC cell lines is distinct from primary tumors, and we detected the activation of E2F, G2M and MYC pathways and the downregulation of interferon response pathway. Each cell line shows a degree of invasiveness in zebrafish in-vivo, and the most invasive ones share the same mutation in RAB14 gene. In addition, the four cell lines secrete cell-line specific EVs containing microRNAs that target YAP, BRG1-AKT1, TCF8-HDAC pathways. Overall, we highlight how the immune system plays a key role in the proliferation of CTCs through EV signaling, and how CTC cell line genomic and transcriptomic alterations make these cells less visible from the immune system and likely responsible for the survival advantage in sites distant from the microenvironment of origin.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have shown that the antitumor immunity of adaptive immune cells is regulated by Vitamin A (retinoic acid, RA). However, it remains unclear whether RA and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling can modulate antitumor immunity by reversing immune exhaustion of innate-like γδ T cells in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Periphery blood samples from patients with NPC were prospectively collected, and phenotypic and functional analyses of γδ T cells were performed using flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing models and RAR inhibitor approaches were utilized to investigate RA/RAR-mediated regulation of T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) and the antitumor activity of γδ T cells. Here, our findings indicate that immune exhaustion markers are highly expressed on peripheral αβ and γδ T cells in NPC patients. Serum RA levels are negatively correlated with the abundance of Tim-3 on circulating Vδ2 T cells. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RA/RAR signaling directly targets Vδ2 T cells, repressing Tim-3 expression, promoting NF-κB activation, and enhancing the production of antitumor-related cytokines. Notably, RA supplementation improved the efficacy of Vδ2 T cell-mediated immunotherapy in human NPC by suppressing Tim-3 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that RA/RAR signaling plays a crucial role in reversing immune exhaustion and represents a promising target for γδ T cell antitumor immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Objective Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating anti-tumor immune responses. However, various factors can suppress DCs function and compromise anti-tumor immunity. Itaconate, a metabolite activated during inflammation and infection, has been identified to possess immunomodulatory properties, but its role on DCs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of itaconate in regulating the maturation and function of DCs and its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were treated with 4-octyl itaconate (4OI). The expression levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II on BMDCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of cytokines was assessed using RT-qPCR. BMDCs with different treatment were adoptively transferred to B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice. The production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein level of NRF2 in BMDCs was analyzed by Western blot. Results Treatment with 4OI represses DC maturation and function. Specifically, 4OI-treated DCs exhibited impaired phenotypic and functional maturation, characterized by decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86, as well as lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, these DCs demonstrated a diminished capacity to stimulate T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 4OI inhibits DCs maturation and function through enhancing and activating KEAP1/NRF2 pathway. Conclusion This study reveals that 4OI inhibits DC function through NRF2 activation, elucidating the immunomodulatory mechanisms of itaconate and emphasizing its pivotal role in developing targeted DC-based tumor immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Despite significant advances in cancer biology research and treatment, clinical outcomes for patients with liver cancer remain unsatisfactory. The biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional signaling between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor progression in the liver, remain to be elucidated. Fibroblasts are crucial regulators of tumor progression and response to therapy; however, our understanding of their roles remains limited. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data of pan-liver cancers to characterize the different subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). siRNA transfection was used for knockdown the expression of LAMA4. Western blot assay was used for gene expression analysis. Flow cytometry was used to detect proliferation, toxicity and cytolytic capacity of CD8+ T cells. To establish a spontaneous murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model, a combined DEN and CCL4 approach was performed. Notably, we identified CD90+ extracellular matrix CAFs (eCAFs) associated with poor prognosis. These CD90+ eCAFs, located distal to the tumor nest, overlapped with the distribution of CD8+ T cells. Functional experiments demonstrated that CD90+ eCAFs recruited CD8+ T cells and inhibited their function through secretion of LAMA4. Further investigation revealed that LAMA4 induced the CD8+ T cell senescence through a DNA damage signaling pathway mediated by the receptor ITGA6. In a mouse model of spontaneous HCC, targeting LAMA4 can inhibit the progression of malignant transformation and synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study reveals the function of specific CAFs subtypes and highlights the importance of interactions with the immune system.

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases are driven, in part, by the activation of (auto)reactive CD4+ T-cells, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for these diseases. Nicotinamide (NAM) has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in various disease models and has already demonstrated safety in several large clinical trials in humans. The mechanisms behind these observations, and especially their direct effects on CD4+ T-cells, remain poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by investigating how NAM influences CD4+ T-cell activation and function. We also describe that NAM treatment significantly suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation in vitro, as evidenced by impaired proliferation and reduced expression of surface activation markers. Additionally, NAM treatment resulted in reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-2, IFNy, and IL-17, further highlighting its anti-inflammatory potential. We found that NAM modulates key metabolic processes, including glycolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production—both essential to T-cell activation. Taken together, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of T-cell activation by NAM, suggesting NAM as an attractive candidate for novel therapies targeting immune-related diseases.">

        <tr id="In the tumor host, neutrophils may exhibit protumor or antitumor activity. It is hypothesized that in response to host-derived or therapy-induced factors, neutrophils adopt diverse functional states to ultimately execute these differential functions. Here, we provide an alternative scenario in which the response of an individual tumor cell population determines the overall protumor versus antitumor outcome of neutrophil‒tumor interactions. Experimentally, we show that human neutrophils, which are sequentially stimulated with bacteria and secreted factors from tumor cells, kill a certain proportion of tumor target cells. However, the majority of the tumor cells remained resistant to this neutrophil-mediated killing and underwent a functional, phenotypic and transcriptomic switch that was reminiscent of partial epithelial‒to-mesenchymal transition. This cell biological switch was associated with physical escape from NK-mediated killing and resulted in enhanced metastasis to the lymph nodes in a preclinical orthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, we identified the antimicrobial neutrophil granule proteins neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) as the molecular mediators of this functional switch. We validated these data in patients with head and neck cancer and identified bacterially colonized intratumoral niches that were enriched for mesenchymal tumor cells and neutrophils expressing NE and MMP-9. Our data reveal the parallel execution of tumor cytotoxic and prometastatic activity by activated neutrophils and identify NE and MMP-9 as mediators of lymph node metastasis. The identified mechanism explains the functional dichotomy of tumor-associated neutrophils at the level of the tumor target cell response and has implications for superinfected cancers and the dysbiotic tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Recombinant interferon alpha (IFNα) has been used to treat cancer patients for over 30 years; however, its clinical utility has been limited by a narrow therapeutic index. Given the recognized anti-tumor and immunomodulatory impacts of IFNα, the development of novel strategies to harness these attributes while minimizing associated toxicity could provide significant benefit for patients. The concept of attenuating IFNα binding affinity for its receptor was conceived to address this challenge and led to the development of CD38-targeted Attenukine™, a CD38-targeted antibody attenuated IFNα immunocytokine. In this study, we sought to delineate the effects of targeting AttenukineTM specifically to tumor cells and/or immune cells using an antibody to CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on certain tumor and immune cells, using different mouse models and anti-human or anti-mouse CD38-targeted Attenukine™. Our results demonstrate that an anti-human CD38 AttenukineTM inhibits tumor growth through direct anti-proliferative effects of IFNα on CD38 + tumor cells as well as by indirectly modulating the anti-tumor immune response. In various in vivo models leveraging syngeneic mice bearing tumors with or without CD38 expression, administration of CD38-murine AttenukineTM mediated anti-tumor efficacy with increased immune activation and intra-tumoral infiltration. These data point to a potential dual mechanism of action for CD38-targeted Attenukine™, involving both tumor- and immune-directed effects, and highlight the potential benefit of a CD38-targeted attenuated IFNα therapy to deliver the known effects of IFNαtreatment to a broad spectrum of patients, while limiting the toxicity typically associated with recombinant IFNα.">

        <tr id="Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of T cell maturation and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell function in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, which counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses. Methods Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and subjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune cell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell exhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell differentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were investigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived tumor organoids. Results MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively associated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It correlates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of immune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting their 3’ untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell promotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T cells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression and suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing ectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in mice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced with miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from the same patients. Conclusions MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ T cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could represent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering promising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells can recognize and kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected cells in vitro, however their role after natural human exposure has not been well-studied. To identify Mtb-responsive NK cell populations, we analyzed the peripheral blood of healthy household contacts of active Tuberculosis (TB) cases and source community donors in an endemic region of Port-au-Prince, Haiti by flow cytometry. We observed higher CD8α expression on NK cells in putative resistors (Interferon γ release assay negative; IGRA− contacts) with a loss of CD8α surface expression during household-associated exposure and active TB disease. In vitro assays and CITE-seq analysis of CD8α+ NK cells demonstrated enhanced maturity, cytotoxic gene expression, and response to cytokine stimulation relative to CD8α− NK cells. CD8α+ NK cells also displayed dynamic surface expression dependent on MHC class I in contrast to conventional CD8+ T cells. Together, these results support a specialized role for CD8α+ NK cell populations during Mtb infection correlating with disease resistance.

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently develops resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, resulting from an immune-excluded microenvironment. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can increase tumor immunogenicity and further augment immune-cell infiltration by releasing immunogenic molecules. Hence, inducing ICD within tumors might be a promising strategy to restore antitumor immunity and sensitize HNSCC to ICB. Herein, we developed shikonin (SHK)-loaded, CGKRK-modified lipid nanoparticles (C-SNPs) and demonstrated that C-SNPs could enrich in tumor cells and induce necroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that C-SNPs suppressed tumor-cell mismatch repair, which later activated the cGAS-mediated IFN response and further increased the expression of PD-L1. Combining C-SNPs with an anti-PD-1 antibody increased the infiltration of DCs and CD8+ T cells, yet the response was limited. Modifying C-SNPs with Mn2+ (C-SMNPs) enhanced the activation of cGAS-STING signaling and further boosted the maturation of DCs and the differentiation of cytotoxic T cells within ICB-treated tumors. Importantly, compared to C-SNPs, the combination of C-SMNPs with ICB resulted in more sustained tumor suppression in vivo. Together, we developed a versatile nanoparticle that delivered SHK and Mn2+ which sensitized HNSCC to ICB by disrupting tumor-cell mismatch repair and boosting the cGAS-STING-mediated IFN response. This nanosized ICD inducer-based strategy holds therapeutic potential in synergizing with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to enhance treatment efficacy in HNSCC.">

We longitudinally sampled the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had active liver inflammation and were starting antiviral therapy. Antiviral therapy suppressed viral replication and liver inflammation, which coincided with decreased myeloid activation markers. Single-cell RNA-Seq mapped peripheral inflammatory markers to a monocyte-derived macrophage population, distinct from Kupffer cells, with an inflammatory transcriptional profile. The inflammatory macrophages (iMacs) differentiated from blood monocytes and were unique from macrophage found in healthy or cirrhotic liver. iMacs retained their core transcriptional signature after inflammation resolved, indicating inflammation-mediated remodeling of the macrophage population in the human liver that may affect progressive liver disease and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in cancer therapy, substantially improving patient survival rates. Our comprehensive research reveals a significant positive correlation between coagulation scores and immune‐related gene expression across 30 diverse cancer types. Notably, tumours exhibiting high coagulation scores demonstrated enhanced infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. Leveraging the TCGA pan‐cancer database, we developed the Coagulation.Sig model, a sophisticated predictive framework utilising a coagulation‐related genes (CRGs) to forecast immunotherapy outcomes. Through rigorous analysis of ten ICI‐treated cohorts, we identified and validated seven critical CRGs: BIRC2, HMGB1, STAT2, IFNAR1, BID, SPATA2, IL33 and IFNG, which form the foundation of our predictive model. Functional analyses revealed that low‐risk tumours characterised by higher immune cell populations, particularly CD8+ T cells, demonstrated superior ICI responses. These tumours also exhibited increased mutation rates, elevated neoantigen loads, and greater TCR/BCR diversity. Conversely, high‐risk tumours displayed pronounced intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and elevated NRF2 pathway activity, mechanisms strongly associated with immune evasion. Experimental validation highlighted BIRC2 as a promising therapeutic target. Targeted BIRC2 knockdown, when combined with anti‐PD‐1 therapy, significantly suppressed tumour growth, enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration, and amplified IFN‐γ and TNF‐α secretion in tumour models. Our findings position the Coagulation.Sig model as a novel, comprehensive approach to personalised cancer treatment, with BIRC2 emerging as both a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic intervention point.">

        <tr id="The intratumoral mycobiome plays a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment, but its impact on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. We collected and quantitatively profiled the intratumoral mycobiome data from 1044 patients with RCC across four international cohorts, of which 466 patients received immunotherapy. Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. Aspergillus tanneri was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis. Our findings suggest that the intratumoral mycobiome suppresses lipid catabolism and induces T cell exhaustion in RCC.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Recent findings reveal that the precursors of exhausted CD8+ T (CD8+ Tpex) cells possess stem-like signatures in tumor immunity, which originate from tumor draining lymph node (TdLN)-derived tumor-specific memory (CD8+ TTSM) cells. Both of these T subsets can be collectively referred to as stem-like CD8+ T cells, which demonstrate robust self-renewal ability and can proliferate and differentiate into transitory effector-like exhausted T cells (Texint). There are reports that chemotherapeutic drugs can promote the antitumor immune responses of patients by increasing the number of CD8+ T cells; however, whether chemotherapeutic drugs increase these two stem-like CD8+ T cells remain further exploration. Methods Tpex cell-associated subpopulations in human colorectal tumors were analyzed by using single-cell sequencing data. CT26 and B16 tumor models of wild type and Eomes conditional knockout mice were constructed, and the changes of TTSM, Tpex and Tex subsets in mice were dissected by flow cytometry after treatment with decitabine (DAC), doxorubicin (DOX) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Results In this study, we demonstrated that DAC and 5-FU expanded CD8+ TTSM cells in TdLNs. At the same time, we validated that DAC and 5-FU substantially promoted the expansion of CD62L+CD8+ Tpex cells and subsequently increased effector function of CX3CR1+ CD8+ Texint cells. In addition, the conditional knockout of transcription factor Eomes in CD8+ T cells partially eliminated DAC-amplified CD62L+ CD8+ Tpex cells, but had no effect on such CD8+ T subset expanded by 5-FU. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that both DAC and 5-FU promoted the differentiation of stem-like CD8+ TTSM cells in TdLNs and significantly enhanced the differentiation and expansion of stem-like CD62L+ CD8+ Tpex and CX3CR1+ Texint cells in tumor microenvironment. The knockout of Eomes partially influenced the role of DAC in promoting the differentiation and expansion of stem-like CD8+ T cells.">

        <tr id="One of the earliest steps of breast cancer metastasis occurs when tumor cells (TCs) disseminate through the bloodstream. There, they interact with several blood components. Among them, platelet favor TC survival and metastatic spread. While the binding of platelet to TC is highly variable, its molecular controls and downstream consequences remain unidentified. Here, we first document that high CD24 expression correlates with increased platelet binding and poorer survival in breast cancer. We further demonstrate that CD24-mediated platelet binding regulates TC cluster formation and resistance to anoikis in vitro. Depleting CD24 expression significantly reduces TC metastatic potential by rewiring the metastatic tumor microenvironment (mTME), affecting immune compartments and secreted factors. Overall, our work identifies CD24 as a molecular cue controlling TC-platelet interaction, dictating their metastatic potential. As such, it represents a druggable target to counteract platelet-TC collaboration in metastasis.">

        <tr id="The roles of circulating complement C3, produced in hepatocytes, in immune defense are well defined in the literature. Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms.">

        <tr id="Introduction Due to the historical dogma that host defense against intracellular pathogens is primarily mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have long been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence highlights the multifaceted role of B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. B cells accumulate at the site of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity are still being unraveled. In addition to producing antibodies, B cells secrete a wide range of cytokines that can influence the local immune response. In this study, we focused on the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-secreting B cells in the long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Methods B cell-specific IL-10 expression was assessed in IL-10 transcriptional reporter (Vert-X) mice following Mtb infection. To investigate the role of B cell-derived IL-10 in TB immunity, both male and female mice with a targeted knockout of IL-10 in B cells (IL-10flox/CD19cre) were infected with Mtb HN878. Disease progression, control of bacterial replication, and immunological changes were monitored throughout the course of infection. Results B cells contribute to IL-10 production in the Mtb-infected lung in both sexes, with CD138+ plasma cells serving as the primary source of B cell-derived IL-10. Mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 exhibited increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, demonstrated by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was associated with male-specific immune alterations. Conclusion Our research highlights a previously unrecognized sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) reinvigorate strong polyclonal T-cell immune responses against tumor cells. For many patients, these therapies fail because the development of spontaneous immune responses is often compromised, as the tumor microenvironment (TME) lacks proinflammatory signals resulting in suboptimal activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Necroptosis is a special form of programmed cell death associated with leakage of inflammatory factors that can lead to APC maturation. However, it is unclear to which extent functional necroptosis in tumor cells contributes to ICI immunotherapy. Methods With genetically engineered tumor cell lines that lack specific components of the necroptosis machinery (mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL), receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)), we addressed the importance of necroptotic tumor cell death for the efficacy of ICI immunotherapy in murine models. Preclinical data were aligned with genome-wide transcriptional programs in patient tumor samples at diagnosis and during ICI treatment for the activity of these pathways and association with treatment outcome. Results Mice bearing MLKL-deficient or RIPK3-deficient tumors failed to control tumor growth in response to anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, defects in the necroptosis pathway resulted in reduced tumor antigen cross-presentation by type 1 conventional dendritic cells (DCs) in tumor-draining lymph nodes, and subsequently impaired immunotherapy-induced expansion of circulating tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and their accumulation and activation in the TME. In vitro, co-culture of tumor cells undergoing necroptotic but not apoptotic programmed cell death resulted in increased uptake by phagocytic cells, associated with maturation and activation of DCs. Treatment of tumors with the epigenetic modulator azacytidine enhanced intrinsic transcriptional activity of the necroptosis machinery, and hence their susceptibility to ICI immunotherapy. In humans, transcriptome analysis of melanoma samples revealed a strong association between high expression of MLKL and prolonged overall survival and durable clinical response to immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. Conclusions Defective necroptosis signaling in tumor cells is a cancer resistance mechanism to ICI immunotherapy. Reversion of epigenetic silencing of the necroptosis pathway can render tumors susceptible to checkpoint inhibition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is a prevalent form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and immune abnormalities play a crucial role in promoting its development. However, the dynamic changes and regulatory characteristics of immune cells during TPE progression remain incompletely understood. This study analyzed DNA methylation and transcriptome data from macrophages and CD4+ T cells from pleural lavage fluid of BCG‐induced tuberculous pleurisy mouse models at specific time points (Days 0, 1, 7, and 14). The results revealed substantial alterations in DNA methylation patterns associated with inflammatory factors and interferon genes. Notably, macrophages exhibited the most pronounced differences in DNA methylation profiles on Day 1, while CD4+ T cells demonstrated gradual changes over time. The investigation further indicated that DNA methylation primarily regulated the differentiation of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells but not Th9 cells. Additionally, single‐cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an increasing expression of C1q during infection, which was regulated by DNA methylation. Importantly, C1q+ and C1q− macrophages demonstrated distinct roles in modulating immune responses during infection. This research provides valuable insights into the DNA methylation profile of immune cells during Mycobacterium bovis infection–induced pleurisy in a mouse model, enhancing our understanding of the upstream regulatory mechanisms underlying immune response development in TPE.">

        <tr id="Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a member of the β-galactoside-binding soluble lectin family, is a double-edged sword in immunity. On one hand, it plays a crucial role in regulating diverse immune cell functions, including the apoptosis of activated T cells. These processes are key in resolving inflammation and preventing autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, Gal-1 has significant implications in cancer, where tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) (e.g., tumor-associated fibroblasts, myeloid-derived suppressor cells) secrete Gal-1 to evade immune surveillance and promote cancer cell growth. Within the TME, Gal-1 enhances the differentiation of tolerogenic dendritic cells, induces the apoptosis of effector T cells, and enhances the proliferation of regulatory T cells, collectively facilitating tumor immune escape. Therefore, targeting Gal-1 holds the potential to boost anti-tumor immunity and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This review provides insights into the intricate role of Gal-1 in immune cell regulation, with an emphasis on T cells, and elucidates how tumors exploit Gal-1 for immune evasion and growth. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of Gal-1 as a therapeutic target to augment current immunotherapies across various cancer types.

        <tr id="Background Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) could regulate inflammatory markers, promote intestinal barrier integrity, and block tumor formation in colon. However, the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on NSCLC and its impact on tumor immunity. Methods We first established a mouse model of Lewis lung cancer, and administered P. distasonis and intrabitoneal injection of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody to assess the impact of P. distasonis on tumor immunity, and mouse intestinal barrier. Then, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secretion mediated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We used the TLR1/2 complex inhibitor CPT22 to evaluate its effect on macrophage activation. Finally, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secreted by TAM in vivo. Results In vivo, P. distasonis enhanced anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1 in NSCLC mice, improved intestinal barrier integrity, recruited macrophages, and promoted M1 polarization. In vitro, CD86 and iNOS levels in BMDM were elevated and CD206 and Arg1 levels were suppressed in membrane fraction of P. distasonis (PdMb) group in comparison to Control group. With additional CPT22 pre-treatment, the levels of CD86 and iNOS in BMDM were reduced, and the levels of CD206 and Arg1 were increased. Compared to PBS group, P. distasonis group exhibited higher proportion of CD8+T cells in tumor tissues, along with increased positive proportion of GZMB and IFN-γ in CD8+T cells. Additionally, in comparison to Control group, PdMb group showed an elevated proportion of GZMB+T and IFN-γ+T cells within CD8+T cells, and secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and GZMB in CD8+T cell supernatant increased. Moreover, the proportion of CXCL9+F4/80+ macrophages in tumor tissues was higher in P. distasonis group compared to PBS group. In comparison to Control group, CXCL9 protein level in BMDM and CXCL9 secretion level in BMDM supernatant were increased in PdMb group. Finally, P. distasonis enhanced CD8+T cell activity by secreting CXCL9 from macrophages in vivo. Conclusions P. distasonis promoted CXCL9 secretion of TAM and enhanced CD8+T cell activity to trigger anti-tumor immunity against anti-PD-1 treatment in NSCLC mice.

        <tr id="T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a specialized subset of CD4+ T lymphocytes that are essential for the development of long-lasting humoral immunity. Tfh cells facilitate B lymphocyte maturation, promote germinal center formation, and drive high-affinity antibody production. Our current knowledge of Tfh interactions with the humoral immune system effectors suggests that they have a critical role in supporting the immune response against viral infections. This review discusses the mechanisms through which Tfh cells influence anti-viral immunity, highlighting their interactions with B cells and their impact on antibody quality and quantity. We explore the role of Tfh cells in viral infections and examine how vaccine design can be improved to enhance Tfh cell responses. Innovative vaccine platforms, such as mRNA vaccines and self-assembling protein nanoplatforms (SAPNs), are promising strategies to enhance Tfh cell activation. Their integration and synergistic combination could further enhance immunity and Tfh responses (SAPN-RNA vaccines). In summary, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current insights into Tfh cells’ role during viral infections, emphasizing their potential as strategic targets for innovative vaccine development.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Mechanisms underlying the T-cell-dependent anti-cancer effect of cyclophosphamide (CTX) are not fully understood. We found that CTX chemotherapy induces long-term survival of mice bearing metastasized breast cancer with chromosomal instability. Given that CTX induces DNA damage and type I interferon (IFN-I) in vivo and that cGAS senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA, we investigated the role of the host cGAS–STING–IFN-I pathway in CTX therapy. We found that CD8+ T cells, the cGAS of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, the STING of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), and the IFN-I response of non-cDC1 myeloid cells are essential for CTX efficacy. Moreover, the cGAS and STING of BM-derived cells positively modulate intratumoral CD8+ T cell populations. Our study shows that the T-cell-dependent anti-tumor effect of CTX critically involves the cGAS–STING–IFN-I axis, the IFN-I response, and the STING-independent cGAS function of host myeloid cells, which supports the deployment of CTX in treating advanced solid tumors by bypassing the often-failed IFN-I production by tumor cells due to a chronic activation of the intrinsic cGAS–STING caused by chromosomal instability.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="T cell engagers (TCEs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the treatment of B and plasma cell malignancies and are emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid tumors. These molecules harness T cells to bind to and eliminate cancer cells, effectively bypassing the need for antigen-specific T cell recognition. Despite their established clinical efficacy, a subset of patients is either refractory to TCE treatment (e.g. primary resistance) or develops resistance during the course of TCE therapy (e.g. acquired or treatment-induced resistance). In this review we comprehensively describe the resistance mechanisms to TCEs, occurring in both preclinical models and clinical trials with a particular emphasis on cellular and molecular pathways underlying the resistance process. We classify these mechanisms into tumor intrinsic and tumor extrinsic ones. Tumor intrinsic mechanisms encompass changes within tumor cells that impact the T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, including tumor antigen loss, the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory ligands and intracellular pathways that render tumor cells resistant to killing. Tumor extrinsic mechanisms involve factors external to tumor cells, including the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and reduced T cell functionality. We further propose actionable strategies to overcome resistance offering potential avenues for enhancing TCE efficacy in the clinic.">

        <tr id="Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a pathogen that is capable of colonizing various infection sites and can potentially elicit an inadequate immune response that will lead to sepsis. The processes underlying this misdirected immune reaction remain poorly understood, and reliable biomarkers for indicating impending organ failure during sepsis are still missing. The present study aims to identify parameters that can predict the onset of end-organ damage in the course of sepsis. To that extent, we investigated key aspects of the immune response in early-phase sepsis following infection of different tissues in a mouse model, using Brefeldin A to link cytokine production to specific cell types through multi-parameter flow cytometry. Subcutaneous and intravenous GAS infections resulted in clinical sepsis, which was paralleled by peripheral blood lymphopenia. Intravenous infection in particular was associated with a higher bacterial burden in the liver that strongly correlated with an increased granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio of the peripheral blood. Strikingly, IL-6 overexpression was more pronounced in intravenous infection and strongly correlated with hepatic stress, indicated by elevated bacterial loads in the liver. Collectively, our data highlight the potential utility of IL-6 in conjunction with an elevated granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio as promising early indicators of concomitant liver stress in sepsis.

        <tr id="Respiratory virus infections, such as those caused by influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronaviruses, pose a significant global health burden. While the immune system’s adaptive components, including memory T cells, are critical for recognizing and combating these pathogens, recurrent infections and variable disease outcomes persist. Memory T cells are a key element of long-term immunity, capable of responding swiftly upon re-exposure to pathogens. They play diverse roles, including cross-reactivity to conserved viral epitopes and modulation of inflammatory responses. However, the protective efficacy of these cells is influenced by several factors, including viral evolution, host age, and immune system dynamics. This review explores the dichotomy of memory T cells in respiratory virus infections: their potential to confer robust protection and the limitations that allow for breakthrough infections. Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the formation, maintenance, and functional deployment of memory T cells in respiratory mucosa is critical for improving immunological interventions. We highlight recent advances in vaccine strategies aimed at bolstering T cell-mediated immunity and discuss the challenges posed by viral immune evasion. Addressing these gaps in knowledge is pivotal for designing effective therapeutics and vaccines to mitigate the global burden of respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) are the current standard treatments for patients with aplastic anemia (AA). However, IST also carries significant risks and side effects, and up to 30–50% of patients experienced refractory or relapsed disease following IST. Treating AA remains challenging and novel efficient therapies are in critical need. The IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) plays a crucial role in the T cell response and functions as a regulator of T cell activity. While ITK inhibition has shown promise in various immune-related disorders, its potential role in the pathophysiology of AA has not been thoroughly investigated. We observed elevated level of phosphorylated ITK in T cells from AA patients and AA mouse models. Moreover, we found that both treatment with an ITK inhibitor or conditional depletion of Itk in donor mice alleviated bone marrow hypoplasia, improved cytopenia, and extended survival rates. Notably, ITK inhibition orchestrates T cell quantity and function by reducing T cell infiltration and suppressing the secretion of key inflammatory cytokines in AA mice. Our data suggest that ITK inhibitor could potentially offer a new therapeutic strategy for AA.

        <tr id="Objective To investigate the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in restoring humoral immune response against HBV. Methods HBV‐persistent C57BL/6J mice were established through hydrodynamic tail vein injection of 10 µg pAAV‐HBV1.2 plasmid. Subsequently, mice treated i.p. with anti‐PD‐L1 and/or anti‐CTLA‐4 at specified time points, with dosages of 500 µg, 250 µg, and 250 µg, respectively. Additionally, 5 × 105 magnetic bead‐purified plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were adoptively transferred i.v. into the acute mouse model followed by anti-PD-L1 treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to assess the expression levels of costimulatory and tolerogenic molecules in two dendritic cell subsets. Serum HBsAg and HBsAb were measured using ELISA. Flow cytometry was utilized to quantify T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), and germinal center (GC) B cells. Results PD-L1 blockade markedly enhanced the differentiation of Tfh cells and GC B cells in HBV-persistent C57BL/6J mice, thereby promoting HBV clearance. Additionally, pDCs exhibited an increased capacity to induce immune tolerance, with pDCs isolated from HBV carriers inducing viral persistence. This persistence was effectively counteracted by treatment with anti-PD-L1. Conclusion pDCs mediate the dysregulation of the humoral immune response to HBV through PD-L1 in chronic hepatitis B infection, highlighting a promising target for the management of chronic HBV.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors, enhancing clinical outcomes by releasing T cells from inhibitory effects of receptors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Despite these advancements, achieving durable antitumor responses remains challenging, often due to additional immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive TME and play a pivotal role in shaping T cell-mediated antitumor responses. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), expressed on myeloid cells, including TAMs, is an inhibitory receptor, which contributes to macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. In this study, we present AZD2796, a high-affinity anti-LILRB2 antibody designed to repolarize TAMs from an immunosuppressive to a proinflammatory phenotype. Methods Anti-LILRB2 antibodies were identified using single-B-cell encapsulation Immune Replica technology. The ability of AZD2796 to enhance proinflammatory responses from macrophages treated with CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide was assessed using a macrophage stimulation assay. A tumor cell/macrophage/T cell co-culture assay was developed to evaluate the effect of AZD2796, as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, on the cytolytic activity of antigen-specific T cells. In vivo assessments were then carried out to determine the ability of AZD2796 to alter tumor growth rate in mice humanized with CD34 hematopoietic stem cells. Results In preclinical assessments, AZD2796 skewed macrophage differentiation away from an immunosuppressive phenotype and enhanced the proinflammatory function of macrophages. AZD2796 significantly increased the anti-tumor response of T cells following PD-1 checkpoint blockade, while AZD2796 monotherapy reduced tumor growth in humanized mouse models. Conclusions These findings support the potential of AZD2796 as an anti-cancer therapy, with the ability to synergize with T-cell-based therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Th17 cells can perform either regulatory or inflammatory functions depending on the cytokine microenvironment. These plastic cells can transdifferentiate into Tregs during inflammation resolution, in allogenic heart transplantation models, or in cancer through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that NLRP3 expression in Th17 cells is essential for maintaining their immunosuppressive functions through an inflammasome-independent mechanism. In the absence of NLRP3, Th17 cells produce more inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, Granzyme B, TNFα) and exhibit reduced immunosuppressive activity toward CD8+ cells. Moreover, the capacity of NLRP3-deficient Th17 cells to transdifferentiate into Treg-like cells is lost. Mechanistically, NLRP3 in Th17 cells interacts with the TGF-β receptor, enabling SMAD3 phosphorylation and thereby facilitating the acquisition of immunosuppressive functions. Consequently, the absence of NLRP3 expression in Th17 cells from tumor-bearing mice enhances CD8 + T-cell effectiveness, ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.">

Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is now recognized as a major cause of septic death, and identifying effective strategies to counteract it poses a significant challenge. This immunosuppression results from the disruption of immune homeostasis, characterized by the abnormal death of immune effector cells, hyperproliferation of immune suppressor cells, release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of immune checkpoints. Preclinical studies targeting immunosuppression, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise in reversing immunocyte dysfunctions and establishing host resistance to pathogens. Here, our review highlights the mechanisms of sepsis-induced immunosuppression and current diagnostic biomarkers, as well as immune-enhancing strategies evaluated in septic patients and therapeutics under investigation.">

        <tr id="Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by heterogeneity in individual responses to therapy. The heterogeneous phenotypes and crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in immunotherapy resistance remain largely unclear. Methods A specific CAF subset was identified by integrating comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and transcriptome profiling of patients with HCC with different responses to antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Mouse orthotopic HCC models and a coculture system were constructed, and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis was performed to investigate the functions and mechanisms of specific CAFs in the immune context of HCC. Results We identified a distinct flavin-containing monooxygenase 2 (FMO2)+ CAF subset associated with a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy and better clinical outcomes. FMO2+ CAFs increase anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy by promoting tertiary lymphoid structure formation and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1-like macrophages through the C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19)-C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 axis. Mechanistically, FMO2 promotes nuclear factor kappa B/p65-mediated CCL19 expression by competitively binding to glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) with praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1 (PJA1), thereby suppressing the PJA1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GYS1. CCL19 treatment potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse orthotopic HCC models. A favorable immunotherapy response was observed in patients with HCC with high serum levels of CCL19. Conclusions We identified a novel FMO2+ CAF subset that serves as a critical regulator of microenvironmental immune properties and a predictive biomarker of the immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. CCL19 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.">

This study investigated the role of CD31+ immune cells, specifically macrophages and T cells, in the glioma microenvironment through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods We employed the CellChat framework to map cell-cell communication pathways and used Monocle3 for pseudotime trajectory analysis to characterize the signaling and developmental progressions within CD31+ cells. Pathways such as osteopontin (SPP1) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) were analyzed in terms of their role in immune regulation, and we examined the expression of ferritin, an iron-binding protein, to assess its potential function in modulating CD31+ cell activity. Results Our findings highlight the expression of key pathways, including SPP1 and MHC-II, influencing immune regulation. Ferritin was found to be highly expressed in CD31+ cells, suggesting a dual role in iron metabolism and immune modulation within the glioma microenvironment. Conclusions This study clarified the distinct roles of CD31+ immune cells in glioma progression and identified ferritin as a potential therapeutic target for modulating immune responses in gliomas. These findings may offer new directions in glioma research and the development of immunotherapy, which can aid in improving treatment outcomes.">

ICI has shown its effectiveness in many solid tumors, but it lacks activity against “cold” tumors which lack CTL infiltration, including most of the colon, prostate, lung and breast cancers. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) responds to PD-1 blockade only in 5–20% cases. Chemotherapy has been shown to have a PD1-sensitizing effect in a fraction of patients with TNBC but the underlying mechanism and the reasoning behind its limitation to only a subset of patients are unknown. Recent data demonstrate the key roles played by paclitaxel-driven Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and the resulting activation of type-1 and type-2 interferon pathways in tumor-associated macrophages, resulting in local M2 to M1 transition and enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation, in the paclitaxel-driven sensitization of “cold” tumors to ICI. These data and the known ability of the TLR4-activated MyD88-NFκB pathway to mobilize both antitumor and tumor-promoting events in the TME provide new tools to enhance the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy for metastatic, and potentially early, TNBC and other taxane-sensitive cancers.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant tumor and stands as the fourth leading contributor to cancer-related fatalities on a global scale. The specific link between CD2 Associated Protein (CD2AP) expression and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear, and further exploration is needed to understand its potential role in immune response and as a target for immunotherapy in GC. Utilizing RNA sequencing data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for a pan-cancer analysis, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out to determine the expression pattern and immunological involvement of CD2AP. Systematic association of CD2AP with immunological features within the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) TME was subsequently performed, encompassing factors like cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). We found that CD2AP was enhanced expression in the TME of a variety of malignancies. CD2AP contributes to forming a stromal reduced TME in GC and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. It was observed that patients with elevated levels of CD2AP, along with high scores on their CD4, CD20, and CD57 immune markers, tended to experience the most favorable prognosis. Furthermore, an IRS was constructed to accurately assess the prognosis of STAD patients. Since CD2AP was associated with the formation of stromal reduced TME in STAD, the expression of CD2AP can improve the effect of immunotherapy of STAD. CD2AP could emerge as a novel prognostic biomarker for STAD, offering a fresh avenue for molecular targeted therapy.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has emerged as a pivotal advancement in cancer treatment, yet its efficacy varies among patients and resistance can develop. This study focuses on TIGIT, a newly identified immune checkpoint, to explore its expression, prognostic significance, and therapeutic potential in hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we found TIGIT highest expression levels in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, with enrichment in immune cells such as NK-T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). A prognostic model incorporating TIGIT expression and other immune-related genes effectively stratified AML patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the former displaying significantly shorter overall survival times. Our model outperformed traditional prognostic factors, highlighting TIGIT’s potential as a superior predictive biomarker. Additionally, our in vitro and in vivo studies showed that combining tiragolumab with azacitidine (AZA) synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, reducing tumor burden and extending survival in a murine AML model. Our findings underscore TIGIT’s role in hematologic malignancies and its potential as a therapeutic target in AML. The combination of AZA with TIGIT inhibition offers a promising new approach for AML treatment, warranting further clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="Recipients’ age has emerged as a key factor that impacts on acute renal allograft rejection and graft survival. Age-related functional and structural changes in the immune system have been observed, yet the precise influence of aged immunity on kidney transplant remains unclear. In an initial retrospective analysis of clinical data gathered from two major centers in China and Germany, we found a correlation between aging and mitigated rejection outcomes in kidney recipients. To study the mechanism, we performed kidney transplantation on mice and observed attenuated allograft rejection in senescent recipients. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of allograft kidneys indicated a protective role of p21high macrophages in aged mice. Supernatant collected from p21high macrophage primary culture inhibited the cytotoxic function and proliferation of CD8+ T cells. Zfp36 is highly expressed in senescent p21high macrophages. To determine its role in renal allograft rejection, we studied mice with Zfp36 conditionally deleted in macrophages (Zfp36-cKO). These mice developed exacerbated allograft rejection with enhanced IL-27 production and CD8+ T cell hyperactivation. Inhibition of IL-27 with neutralizing antibody or deletion of IL-27 receptor on CD8+ T cells reversed acute renal allograft rejection in Zfp36-cKO mice. Moreover, in vitro silencing Zfp36 with siRNA led to impaired degradation of IL-27 p28 mRNA and a subsequent increase of IL-27 in p21high macrophages. In conclusion, senescent macrophages protect renal allograft rejection by suppressing CD8+ T cells via a Zfp36/IL-27-dependent mechanism. These findings may provide innovative therapeutic strategies for addressing kidney allograft rejection.">

        <tr id="Newborns exhibit a heightened vulnerability to inflammatory disorders due to their underdeveloped immune system, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report that plasma spermidine is correlated with the maturity of human newborns and reduced risk of inflammation. Administration of spermidine led to the remission of neonatal inflammation in mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that spermidine enhanced the generation of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) via downstream eIF5A hypusination. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), a key enzyme of hypusinated eIF5A (eIF5AHyp), diminished the immunosuppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs, leading to aggravated neonatal inflammation. The eIF5AHyp pathway was found to enhance the immunosuppressive function via histone acetylation–mediated epigenetic transcription of immunosuppressive signatures in PMN-MDSCs. These findings demonstrate the spermidine-eIF5AHyp metabolic axis as a master switch to restrict neonatal inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background: The chaotic, over-activated tumor vasculature promotes tumor growth and erodes most current therapies. Although Notch activation critically regulates angiogenesis, the broad roles of Notch has dampened its druggability. Methods: Gene-modified mice with a Cdh5-CreERT transgene were employed to activate/block Notch signaling in endothelial cells (ECs). Multiple transcriptome analyses were conducted to compare gene expression profiles. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to determine gene expression level. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to observe morphological alterations and immune microenvironment in tumors. Nanoparticles (PEI-PEG-cRGD) were used to deliver siRNA into tumor ECs (TECs) in vivo. Results: Genetic Notch activation or blockade in TECs normalizes or deteriorates tumor vessels, respectively. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that Notch activation selectively reduced the proliferating TEC subset, which accounted for about 30% of TECs and gave rise to other TEC subsets. Notch activation or blockade downregulated or upregulated MYC, respectively. MYC overexpression canceled Notch activation-induced proliferation arrest of TECs in vitro, and a MYC inhibitor normalized tumor vessels in RBPj deficient mice, suggesting that MYC is the authentic Notch target in normalizing tumor vessels. Nanoparticles encapsulated with MYC siRNA (EC-siMYC) or miR-218 (EC-miR-218), a Notch-downstream miRNA suppressing MYC, were able to mitigate Notch inhibition-induced tumor vessel defects. Combination of cisplatin with MYC blockade exhibited improved therapeutic effects. Moreover, MYC blockade promoted T cell infiltration and enhanced anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Conclusions: Together, our data have demonstrated that Notch activation normalizes tumor vessels by repressing the proliferating TEC subset via MYC, and targeting endothelial MYC using nanoparticles bearing siRNA or miRNA is an efficient strategy for tumor anti-angiogenic therapy.">

        <tr id="γδT cells represent a unique and versatile subset of T cells characterized by the expression of T-cell receptors (TCRs) composed of γ and δ chains. Unlike conventional αβT cells, γδT cells do not require major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent antigen presentation for activation, enabling them to recognize and respond to a wide array of antigens, including phosphoantigens, stress-induced ligands, and tumor-associated antigens. While γδT cells are relatively rare in peripheral blood, they are enriched in peripheral tissues such as the skin, intestine, and lung. These cells play a crucial role in tumor immunotherapy by exerting direct cytotoxicity through the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-17 (IL-17)) and cytotoxic molecules (e.g., perforin and granzyme). Recent advances in γδT cell research have elucidated their mechanisms of tumor recognition, including the detection of phosphoantigens and stress-induced ligands like MICA (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A), MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B), and ULBP (UL16-binding protein). Furthermore, various strategies to enhance γδT cell-based tumor immunotherapy have been developed, such as in vitro expansion using phosphoantigen-based therapies, cytokine stimulation, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδT cell engineering. These advancements have shown promising results in both preclinical and clinical settings, paving the way for γδT cells to become a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy. This review highlights the key mechanisms, functions, and strategies to harness the potential of γδT cells for effective tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Upon activation, B cells undergo either the germinal center (GC) or extrafollicular (EF) response. While GC are known to generate high‐affinity memory B cells and long‐lived plasma cells, the role of the EF response is less well understood. Initially, it was thought to be limited to that of a source of fast but lower‐quality antibodies until the GC can form. However, recent evidence strongly supports the EF response as an important component of the humoral response to infection. EF responses are now also recognized as a source of pathogenic B cells in autoimmune diseases. The EF response itself is dynamic and regulated by pathways that are only recently being uncovered. We have identified that the cytokine IL‐12 acts as a molecular switch, enhancing the EF response and suppressing GC through multiple mechanisms. These include direct effects on both B cells themselves and the coordinated differentiation of helper CD4 T cells. Here, we explore this pathway in relation to other recent advancements in our understanding of the EF response's role and highlight areas for future research. A better understanding of how the EF response forms and is regulated is essential for advancing treatments for many disease states.">

Here, using a KrasG12D/+-induced mouse model of MPN, we demonstrated that the number and cycling of CD45-Ter119+ cells increased in the spleens of MPN mice. Moreover, these cells could differentiate into myeloid cells upon stimulation with GM-CSF and mIL-6. Through RNA sequencing, we further revealed that myeloid genes, such as Hoxa9, Mpo and Ms4a3, were highly expressed in CD45-Ter119+ cells. Mechanistically, we showed that the arachidonic acid content was significantly elevated in splenic CD45-Ter119+ cells, and exogenous arachidonic acid mediated the differentiation of splenic CD45-Ter119+ cells into myeloid cells. Our results revealed that splenic CD45-Ter119+ cells play a crucial role in myeloid leukemia and that arachidonic acid could be a potential therapeutic target for MPN treatment.">

Therefore, γδ T cell-based immunotherapies have been extensively explored for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Several therapeutic strategies based on γδ T cells have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising safety and efficacy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for flavivirus infections, which are typically characterized by acute onset. Research has shown that γδ T cells can rapidly expand during the early phases of flavivirus infections and effectively suppress viral replication, making them an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for flavivirus infections.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has transformed the landscape of cancer treatment, with T cell‐based strategies at the forefront of this revolution. However, the durability of these responses is frequently undermined by two intertwined phenomena: T cell exhaustion and senescence. While exhaustion is driven by chronic antigen exposure in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, leading to a reversible state of diminished functionality, senescence reflects a more permanent, age‐ or stress‐induced arrest in cellular proliferation and effector capacity. Together, these processes represent formidable barriers to sustained anti‐tumor immunity. In this review, we dissect the molecular underpinnings of T cell exhaustion and senescence, revealing how these dysfunctions synergistically contribute to immune evasion and resistance across a range of solid tumors. We explore cutting‐edge therapeutic approaches aimed at rewiring the exhausted and senescent T cell phenotypes. These include advances in immune checkpoint blockade, the engineering of “armored” CAR‐T cells, senolytic therapies that selectively eliminate senescent cells, and novel interventions that reinvigorate the immune system's capacity for tumor eradication. By spotlighting emerging strategies that target both exhaustion and senescence, we provide a forward‐looking perspective on the potential to harness immune rejuvenation. This comprehensive review outlines the next frontier in cancer immunotherapy: unlocking durable responses by overcoming the immune system's intrinsic aging and exhaustion, ultimately paving the way for transformative therapeutic breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Background CD169+ macrophages in lymph nodes (LNs) activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which play a crucial role in anticancer immunity, through antigen presentation and co-stimulation by CD169. Interferon alpha (IFNα) is capable of inducing the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages; however, its clinical applications have been hindered by pharmacokinetic limitations—low LN distribution and an inability to target macrophages. To overcome these issues, this study genetically fused mouse IFNα (mIFNα) with mannosylated mouse serum albumin (Man-MSA), and investigated the antitumor effects of the hybrid protein (Man-MSA-mIFNα) or its add-on effects with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade. Methods To confirm the possibility of CD169+ macrophage-mediated T cell priming, positional information about individual immune cells in LNs of cancer patients was obtained. Traits of Man-MSA-mIFNα, which was prepared using Pichia pastoris to form the high-mannose structure, were characterized by several physicochemical methods. To evaluate the lymphatic drainage of Man-MSA-mIFNα, radioiodine or Cy5-labeled Man-MSA-mIFNα was subcutaneously administered in mice, and then the radioactivity or fluorescence in LNs was analyzed. CD169-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (CD169-DTR) mice in which LN CD169+ macrophages can be depleted by DT injection were used to verify whether the antitumor effect of Man-MSA-mIFNα is dependent on LN CD169+ macrophages. Results Multiplex tissue imaging predicted close proximity of CD169+ macrophages and T cells and positive correlation between the number of CD169+ macrophages and T cells in neighborhoods in LNs of cancer patients. Physicochemical analyses showed that Man-MSA-mIFNα was formed from the fusion of the intact Man-MSA and mIFNα. Man-MSA-mIFNα efficiently induced the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages by its high LN distribution and macrophage-targeting capability, and significantly exerted antitumor activity through CD8+ T cell activation in the LNs, whereas its antitumor effects were canceled in CD169-DTR mice. Finally, combination therapy with PD-L1 blockade markedly suppressed tumor growth in MB49-bearing mice, which exhibit resistance to PD-L1 blockade monotherapy. Conclusions The present study successfully designed and developed Man-MSA-mIFNα, which efficiently induces the CD169+ phenotype in LN macrophages, contributing to the antitumor immunity. The findings suggest that our novel strategy targeting CD169⁺ macrophages could be a promising immunotherapy for cancer patients who are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

        <tr id="Abstract The pathophysiology of sepsis is orchestrated by a delicate and dynamic interaction between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Essential factors influencing this process include interleukin-7 (IL-7), the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis, and cellular apoptosis. These elements shape the immune response in sepsis, influencing its progression and outcomes. IL-7 is an important cytokine maintaining lymphocyte function and survival. At the same time, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis acts as a modulatory checkpoint suppressing immune activation to prevent overreaction but can exacerbate immunosuppression during sepsis. Cellular apoptosis impairs the host’s ability to mount an effective defence, especially against secondary infections. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms through which sepsis results in organ dysfunction and immune dysregulation remain incompletely understood. The global burden of sepsis emphasizes the urgent need for innovative approaches, paving the way for personalized, immune-based therapies. This review aims to delve into and synthesize the current knowledge regarding cellular apoptosis, the regulatory role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, and the critical functions of IL-7 in sepsis, with a focus on their underlying mechanisms, clinical relevance, and potential as targets for future immunomodulatory treatments.">

        <tr id="The immune checkpoint CD47 is highly upregulated in several cancers as an innate immune escape mechanism. CD47 delivers a “don’t eat me” signal to its co-receptor signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα), thereby inhibiting phagocytosis. Blocking the CD47–SIRPα axis is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy against cancer. However, early trial data has demonstrated on-target off-leukemia toxicity. In addition, the ubiquitous expression pattern of CD47 might contribute to an antigen sink. In this study, we combined low-affinity CD47 checkpoint blockade and specific tumor targeting in a multivalent and multifunctional antibody construct to prevent CD47-related toxicities. First, we established a local inhibitory checkpoint monoclonal antibody (LicMAb) by fusing two N-terminal extracellular domains of SIRPα to a full-length anti-human mesothelin (MSLN)-IgG1 antibody, a well-described tumor-associated antigen in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Next, we evaluated the SIRPα-αMSLN LicMAb for mediating a tumor-restricted immune response as observed by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP). Our data validates CD47 and MSLN as highly upregulated targets expressed on various solid cancer entities, particularly EOC. We show tumor-specific binding and CD47 blocking by the SIRPα-αMSLN LicMAb even in the presence of healthy CD47-expressing cells. Furthermore, the LicMAb induces NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity and improves phagocytosis of EOC and PDAC tumor cells. Moreover, cell death in EOC-derived organoids was specifically LicMAb-driven. Hence, the SIRPα-αMSLN LicMAb combines a tumor-restricted blockade of the CD47–SIRPα axis with a specific antitumor response while preventing on-target off-tumor toxicities. Our data supports the multifunctional SIRPα-αMSLN LicMAb as a promising approach to treating solid tumors. Graphical abstract The local inhibitory checkpoint monoclonal antibody (LicMAb) binds mesothelin (MSLN) with high affinity and simultaneously blocks CD47 on MSLN-expressing tumor cells to inhibit the “don’t eat me” signal. CD47 is blocked by the fused extracellular SIRPα domain that intrinsically has a low affinity. Furthermore, the SIRPα-αMSLN LicMAb is based on a human IgG1 backbone to provide an Fc receptor (FcR)-activating stimulus to enable direct NK-cell-mediated killing by granzyme B (GrzB) and perforin secretion, and an additional pro-phagocytic signal to phagocytic cells, such as macrophages (MØ). This leads to tumor-restricted antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of cancer cells.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal cancer of the central nervous system, presenting substantial treatment challenges. The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. It also summarizes recent progress in TAM-targeted therapies, which may, in combination with other treatments like immunotherapy, pave the way for more effective and personalized strategies against this aggressive malignancy.">

        <tr id="The potential of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination against cancer is not fully achieved. Little is known about the precise nature of the anti-cancer immune response triggered by different natural DC subsets and their relevance in preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. Here, we use mouse splenic conventional DC1s (cDC1s) or cDC2s pulsed with tumor cell lysates to generate DC vaccines. cDC1-based vaccination induces a stronger effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ anti-tumor T cell response, leading to a better control of tumors treated either therapeutically or prophylactically. Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4+ tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8+ memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4+ Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma. Our findings suggest that cDC1-based vaccination excels at immune memory induction and prevention of cancer recurrence.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are critical for the maintenance of self‐tolerance, and their absence or dysfunction can result in autoimmunity. To determine the critical cell type controlled by Treg and potentially the suppressor mechanism utilized by Treg in the steady state, we utilized mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) exclusively on Treg cells. Complete depletion of Treg was achieved 24 h after DT treatment, but profound activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as measured by induction of CD44 expression and proliferation required 3–4 days. Increased expression of CD80/CD86 was observed on dendritic cells and more prominently on macrophages after 3 days. Depletion of CD4+ T cells or macrophages resulted in ∼50% inhibition of T‐cell activation. The initial steps in T‐cell activation were completely independent of IFN‐γ or IL‐2, while upregulation of CD80/CD86 was partially dependent on IFN‐γ. Complete reversal of immune activation post‐Treg depletion was only achieved by blockade of CD80/CD86 interactions with CD28. We conclude that the major mechanism used by Treg in the steady state is the regulation of CD80/CD86 expression and dysregulation of this suppressor pathway results in lethal autoimmunity driven by co‐stimulatory signals in concert with TCR stimulation, or even by costimulatory signals alone.">

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Nature , Breart et al. 1 untangled the controversy surrounding interleukin (IL)-27 ’ s role in regulating T cell differentiation and immune responses in cancer. Their ﬁ ndings reveal that IL-27 enhances the persistence and effector functions of tumor-in ﬁ ltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (TILs), preventing exhaustion, sustaining T cell-dependent tumor control and immunotherapy ef ﬁ cacy without signi ﬁ cant systemic side effects. Effective immune control of cancer relies on the ability of T lymphocytes to in ﬁ ltrate tumors and exert their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, surviving neoplastic cells promptly adapt to immune-patrolled environments and evolve under immune system pressure to progressively avoid immune clearance, establishing immune-privileged conditions that sustain limitless growth. These immune evasive strategies are deployed in 3 main routes: “ camou ﬂ age ” (reduced immunogenicity and immune exclusion), “ coercion ” (impaired local immune activation through the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment [TME]), “ cytoprotection ” (avoiding neoplastic cell killing through intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms). 2 Therapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoints and aiming to restore cancer immune surveillance signi ﬁ cantly improved the survival and life quality of cancer patients, although their ef ﬁ cacy is restricted to a fraction of patients and tumor types. Breart et al. attempted to identify novel, actionable immunological targets by charting the cytokines, which are known to be the most potent immune system regulators.

        <tr id="Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) play a crucial role in modulating tumor immune responses and influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, our current understanding of the microenvironment within these lymph nodes remains limited. Tumors not only impair the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment, but they also facilitate immune evasion and promote metastasis by altering the structure and function of TDLNs. Research has shown that tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells (TTSM) within TDLNs are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockers. Moreover, the abnormal structure of TDLNs, along with the presence of immunosuppressive cells—such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), and immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs)—contributes to tumor-mediated immune evasion. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the immune microenvironment within TDLNs is essential for improving the effectiveness of immunotherapies and developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review explores various TDLN-based therapeutic strategies, addressing the controversies surrounding lymph node dissection, the use of TDLNs as a source of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for therapy, targeting immunosuppressive cells within TDLNs, and methods to reverse the structural abnormalities of TDLNs. These strategies offer valuable insights and potential directions for advancing tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background The role of T cell immunity during antineoplastic therapy is poorly understood. In the BEGYN-1 study, patients with breast cancer underwent quarterly assessments prior to and during antineoplastic therapy over a period of 12 months. Methods We used flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays to quantify 25 T cell subpopulations and seven T cell associated plasma cytokines in peripheral blood from 92 non-metastatic breast cancer patients, respectively. In addition, the association between T cell dynamics and the outcome of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was investigated. Results In patients undergoing chemotherapy, a significant reduction in T helper (Th) cells, particularly naïve central and effector cells and thymus positive Th cells, was observed over time. Interestingly, Th1 immune response-associated cytokines (IL-12, TNF, IFN-γ) declined while Th2 cells and cytotoxic T cells increased over time. Conclusions We conclude that in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy is associated with a transition from a Th1 immune response towards Th2 and an increase in cytotoxic T cells, whereas in patients without chemotherapy, these alterations were less pronounced. Future studies should clarify whether patterns of T cell subsets or plasma cytokines can be used as biomarkers to monitor or even improve therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with high resistance and recurrence rates, with only one fifth of patients eligible for surgical treatment. The disease resists standard chemotherapy and often relapses. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promise for hematological malignancies but faces challenges in solid tumors due to resistance mechanisms like PD-L1 expression, which tumors use to evade the immune system. To address this challenge, we developed fifth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 that also secrete anti-PD-L1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to target both tumor cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. We examined integrin αvβ6 and PD-L1 expression in CCA cell lines and engineered T cells to express either fourth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 (A20 CAR4 T cells) or fifth-generation CAR T cells with anti-PD-L1 scFv secretion (A20 CAR5 T cells). In vitro, A20 CAR5 T cells exhibited less exhaustion and superior long-term functionality compared to A20 CAR4 T cells. In 3D spheroid models of CCA, A20 CAR5 T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity and better infiltration into the spheroid core. These findings suggest that A20 CAR5 T cells have significant potential and warrant further in vivo studies and clinical trials.

The oral oncogenic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum) was recently observed to suppress the anti‐tumour immune response, although the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from F.nucleatum (F.n‐OMVs) promoted HNSCC progression by inducing immunosuppressive phenotypes of tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in decreased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration in vivo. Mechanistically, TAMs internalized tryptophanase presented in F.n‐OMVs, which activated the tryptophan‐2,3‐dioxygenase 2/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (TDO2/AHR) pathway and upregulated the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoints. TDO2 inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti‐programmed death‐1 in a tumour‐bearing mouse model. Both TDO2 and F.nucleatum demonstrated excellent performance in predicting the immunotherapy outcomes in patients with HNSCC. These results indicate that F.n‐OMVs induce immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC, providing novel insights into the microbiota–tumour immunity crosstalk.">

        <tr id="Background The dismal efficacy of immunotherapy for Pancreatic cancer (PC) can be predominantly ascribed to its distinctive cold-tumor properties. The by-products of purine metabolic reprogramming are extensively engaged in tumor immune modulation, influencing the functions and recruitment of immune cells and molding an immune microenvironment that is propitious for tumor growth. Methods We harnessed single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics to concurrently analyze the purine metabolism (PM) features of the PC microenvironment. We quantitatively appraised the PM traits of diverse cell subsets via scoring algorithms such as AUCell and Ucell. Moreover, cell development and cell-cell interaction analysis elucidated the alterations in TME induced by PM dysregulation. Additionally, we defined the PM disorder characteristics of PC patients and utilized this to assess the immune phenotypes and prognoses of the patient population. Also, we identified the crucial intermediate genes that impact PM reprogramming and the establishment of an immunosuppressive environment within the TME of PC, and validated them through spatial sectioning and cell co-culture experiments. Results Multi - dimensional transcriptome data elucidated the unique heterogeneity of PM in the PC microenvironment, which manifested that tumor cells and fibroblasts demonstrating higher PM scores in the TME. Cellchat analysis revealed that malignant cells with elevated PM expression were concomitantly associated with frequent interactions with CAFs as well as high expression of ligand-receptor pairs and transcription factors. Spatial data further corroborated this finding. Furthermore, the newly constructed PM disorder criteria indicated that patients with high PM levels were associated with a lack of response to immunotherapy and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Finally, this study identified the singular role of NT5E in the immunosuppression resulting from PM reprogramming in PC. CCK8 and invasion experiments following the co-culture model demonstrated that intervention targeting NT5E could reverse the augmented malignancy of PC induced by co-cultured CAFs. NT5E is potentially a key target for reversing the “stiff-cancer” characteristics of PC. Conclusion This study demonstrates that PM metabolic disorders could impinge upon tumor immunotherapy and exacerbate the immunosuppression engendered by the progression of PC fibrosis. Therapeutic strategies targeting PM or NT5E may offer a ray of hope for patients with advanced PDAC.">

        <tr id="Integrin Mac-1 plays a critical role in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we developed a myeloid-specific Mac-1–deficient mouse. Using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, we report that Mac-1 on myeloid cells is key to disease development. Our data reveal that myeloid-specific Mac-1 significantly increases EAE severity and hinders disease regression. Loss of Mac-1 increases Gr-1+ cells in peripheral tissues and the CNS and preferably accelerates the transition of Ly6Chi monocytes from a pro-inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in a disease stage–dependent manner. Mechanistically, our results demonstrate that Mac-1 suppresses interferon-γ production and prevents monocytes from acquiring immunosuppressive functions by reducing the expression of iNOS, IDO, and CD84.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), pivotal immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), exhibit dual potential in both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects. These cells display remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity within the TME, adapting to hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions through metabolic reprogramming while critically influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. The metabolic reprogramming of TANs not only modulates their functional phenotypes but also reshapes tumor biological behaviors and therapeutic responses by regulating metabolic intermediates and cellular interactions within the TME. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying TANs metabolic reprogramming has significant implications for deciphering the molecular basis of tumorigenesis, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies. This review systematically summarizes current knowledge regarding metabolic reprogramming mechanisms of TANs in the TME and their impact on tumor progression. We particularly focus on: 1) TAN-specific alterations in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism within the TME; 2) Emerging immunotherapeutic strategies targeting TANs metabolic pathways; 3) Recent advances in understanding TAN-mediated immune evasion and therapy resistance. Furthermore, this review discusses potential challenges and corresponding solutions in targeting TANs metabolic reprogramming for therapeutic intervention, aiming to provide novel insights for advancing cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM’s persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their “accomplices,” undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer. It remains incurable, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated a panel of peptides derived from a functional motif of Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family 1 (SLAMF1) with single amino acid substitutions and found that several of them exhibited potent anti-cancer activity by inducing MM cell death. The most potent peptide P7N4 significantly reduced the viability of both IL-6-dependent and -independent human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), proteasome inhibitor-resistant MM cells, and primary MM cells, while exerting minimal effects on healthy blood cells. Furthermore, P7N4 enhanced the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan. When combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, P7N4 potentiated the anti-cancer effect of bortezomib in a highly aggressive murine MM model. Mechanistically, P7N4 induced apoptosis in MM cells by disrupting key pro-survival pathways, leading to reduction in IRF4, MYC, and β-catenin levels, as well as inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in peptide-sensitive HMCL, P7N4 significantly altered the expression of IRF4-associated genes. These effects were likely mediated by direct interaction of peptide with IRF4, targeting this transcription factor for degradation. Overall, our findings established P7N4 as a promising therapeutic candidate for MM, warranting further optimization and in-depth mechanistic studies.">

The pathophysiology of IBD remains unclear, likely involving aberrant innate and adaptive immunity. Studies have reported altered population of MDSCs in patients with IBD. However, their distribution varies among patients and different preclinical models of IBD. The expansion and activation of MDSCs are likely driven by various stimuli during intestinal inflammation, but the in-depth mechanisms remain poorly understood. The role of MDSCs in the pathogenesis of IBD appears to be paradoxical. In addition to intestinal inflammation, suppressive MDSCs may promote colitis-to-colon cancer transition. In this Review, we summarize recent progresses on the features, activation, and roles of MDSCs in the development of IBD and IBD-associated colon cancer.">

        <tr id="Purpose CD4+ effector T cells (Teffs) play a key role in immune responses by infiltrating the sites of inflammation and modulating local leukocyte activity. In turn resident immune cells shape their response. This study aimed to investigate the influence of mast cells (MCs) on Teff biological responses. Methods This study examined human MC-Teff interactions, focusing on how MCs shape Teff responses. Flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and cytokine assays were used to analyze the impact of primary human MCs on the Teff phenotype and function. MC-Teff crosstalk within Crohn’s disease patient tissues was assessed using confocal microscopy and advanced image analysis. Results MCs promoted the differentiation of Th17 cells, particularly the inflammatory Th17.1 subset, that secretes IFN-γ and GM-CSF. This differentiation was driven by the PGE2 and IL-1β axis. Additionally, MCs disrupted the phenotype and impaired the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) through PGE2, skewing the Th17/Treg balance. The analysis of biopsies from patients with Crohn’s disease indicated that this MC/Teff crosstalk may play a role in the pathogenesis of auto-inflammatory processes. Conclusion MCs influence CD4+ T cell responses by fostering pro-inflammatory Th17 differentiation while impairing Treg function. This interaction underpins a Th17/Treg imbalance, which is significant in auto-inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease, positioning MCs as critical drivers of disease pathogenesis.">

While vaccine-induced TRM express high levels of CD103 and persist longer in the lung parenchyma, short-lived, H1N1-induced TRM have a transcriptome associated with higher cytotoxic potential and distinct transcriptional profile as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing. In both the vaccine and H1N1 groups, NP-specific CD8+ T cells expand during heterologous influenza virus infection and protect the mice from disease. Meanwhile, lung inflammation in response to an infection with unrelated respiratory syncytial virus do not influence the fate of pre-existing TRM. Our preclinical work thus confirms that inflammatory conditions in the tissue shape the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TRM to serve relevant informations for optimizing mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an exceedingly aggressive primary brain tumor defined by rapid growth, extensive infiltration, and resistance to standard therapies. A central factor driving these malignancies is the subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which possess self-renewal capacity, multipotency, and the ability to regenerate tumor heterogeneity. GSCs contribute to key hallmarks of GBM pathobiology, including relentless progression, resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and inevitable recurrence. GSCs exhibit distinct molecular signatures, enhanced DNA repair, and metabolic adaptations that protect them against conventional treatments. Moreover, they reside within specialized niches—such as perivascular or hypoxic microenvironments—that sustain stemness, promote immunosuppression, and facilitate angiogenesis. Recent discoveries highlight signaling pathways like Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, STAT3-PARN, and factors such as TFPI2 and HML-2 as critical regulators of GSC maintenance, plasticity, and immune evasion. These findings underscore the complexity of GSC biology and their pivotal role in driving GBM heterogeneity and therapeutic failure. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to target GSCs through multiple avenues, including surface markers, immunotherapeutics (e.g., CAR T cells), metabolic vulnerabilities, and combination regimens. Advances in patient-derived organoids, single-cell omics, and 3D co-culture models enable more accurate representation of the tumor ecosystem and personalized therapeutic approaches. Ultimately, improved understanding of GSC-specific targets and the tumor microenvironment promises more effective interventions, paving the way toward better clinical outcomes for GBM patients.">

        <tr id="The immune system plays a major role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with remarkable immunosuppressive functions. We hypothesized that their anti‐inflammatory activity may dampen PF by inhibiting inflammation and its transition to fibrosis. Here, we studied the emergence of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)‐ and monocytic (M)‐MDSCs in a murine model of PF. We assessed immunological, histopathological, and clinical changes at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 following bleomycin challenge. A comprehensive overview of the role of MDSCs during the acute lung injury and chronic phase of pulmonary fibrosis is provided, along with the effects of MDSCs adoptive transfer and depletion. Inflammation and fibrosis increased over a period of 21 days after bleomycin administration. In the lung, the number of PMN‐MDSCs increased, while M‐MDSCs decreased over the time following bleomycin challenge. Especially, M‐MDSCs showed enhanced suppressive activity on day 3 following bleomycin challenge. Adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs attenuated inflammation and fibrosis development. However, depletion of PMN‐MDSCs did not lead to an exacerbation of PF. Our results suggest that adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs can ameliorate the inflammatory responses and thus the development of fibrosis in a bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis model.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and highly lethal type of primary brain tumor in adults. Therapeutic failure is partly attributed to a fraction of Glioblastoma Stem Cells (GSCs) that show high levels of heterogeneity and plasticity. GSCs exist in a transcriptional gradient between two states: Developmental (Dev) and Injury Response (IR) in which IR-GSCs exhibit more invasive behaviors. While previous studies have identified fitness genes in GSCs, the genes required to establish and maintain the Dev and IR states remain poorly defined. To identify the regulators of the IR GSC state, we performed a phenotypic genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen in patient-derived GSCs based on cell surface expression of the IR marker CD44. Notably, we found that perturbations of the histone acetyltransferase EP300 in IR GSCs led to decreased CD44 cell surface expression, significant downregulation of gene expression signatures associated with the IR state, and to decreased self-renewal and invasion. Furthermore, genetic targeting of Ep300 in a mouse GBM model delayed tumor initiation and/or progression. Collectively, our results establish EP300 as a regulator of the IR state in GSCs and provide a mechanistic basis for its therapeutic targeting in GBM. Significance A genome-wide phenotypic CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a patient-derived Glioblastoma Stem Cell line identified the genes required to maintain the Injury-Response cellular state, with a focus on the histone acetyl transferase gene EP300. This study suggests how therapeutic targeting of cellular state could reduce the aggressiveness of GBM tumors.">

        <tr id="The nexus between aging-associated immune deteriorations and tumorigenesis of lung cancers remains elusive. In a mouse model with Med23 depletion in T cells (Med23 -/-), it is found a strong association between the decline of CD103+ T cells and spontaneous alveolar epithelial type II cell (AT2 cell)-originated lung adenocarcinomas. The reduction of CD103+ T cells in the lung results in an accumulation of AT2 cells bearing oxidative damages, which appears to be the major origin of the lung adenocarcinoma. Functional experiments reveal CD103+ T cells can eradicate oxidative-damage-bearing AT2 cells as well as ROS-dependent, KRAS (G12D)-driven tumorigenesis. In vitro co-cultures prove CD103+ T cells, especially CD103+ CD8+ T cells, exhibit a killing capacity that matches the oxidative stress level in the target cells. In aged animals, it is found the abundance of CD103+ CD8+ T cells in the lung declines with age, accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative-damage-bearing AT2 cells. Collectively, the study establishes the vital function of CD103+ T cells in surveilling epithelial cells under oxidative stress to prevent malignancies, and unravels a potential immuno-dysregulation in the aged lung which contributes to tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis represents an emerging, iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. In recent years, it has garnered significant attention in the realm of cancer immunotherapy, particularly in studies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors. This form of cell death not only enhances our comprehension of the tumor microenvironment but is also considered a promising therapeutic strategy to address tumor resistance, investigate immune activation mechanisms, and facilitate the development of cancer vaccines. The combination of immunotherapy with ferroptosis provides innovative targets and fresh perspectives for advancing cancer treatment. Nevertheless, tumor cells appear to possess a wider array of ferroptosis evasion strategies compared to CD8+T cells, which have been conclusively shown to be more vulnerable to ferroptosis. Furthermore, ferroptosis in the TME can create a favorable environment for tumor survival and invasion. Under this premise, both inducing tumor cell ferroptosis and inhibiting T cell ferroptosis will impact antitumor immunity to some extent, and even make the final result run counter to our therapeutic purpose. This paper systematically elucidates the dual-edged sword role of ferroptosis in the antitumor process of T cells, briefly outlining the complexity of ferroptosis within the TME. It explores potential side effects associated with ferroptosis-inducing therapies and critically considers the combined application of ferroptosis-based therapies with ICIs. Furthermore, it highlights the current challenges faced by this combined therapeutic approach and points out future directions for development.">

Given the increasing application of ICIs in cancer therapy, ECP might offer a promising alternative to glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive treatments that may diminish therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy. 2 ECP is an immunomodulatory therapy initially developed for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Its clinical applications have expanded to include conditions such as acute graft-versus-host disease and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. 3 The procedure involves leukapheresis, photoactivation, and reinfusion of treated cells. This article explores the mechanisms of action in immune regulation in the context of irAEs. Braun et al. investigated the impact of ECP vs. glucocorticoids on anti-PD-1 therapy in multiple cancer models. 1 Their ﬁ ndings revealed that glucocorticoids treatment led to reduced survival, increased tumor burden, and diminished in ﬁ ltration of tumor-speci ﬁ c T cells across various cancers, including melanoma, lung, colon, and renal cancers.

        <tr id="Background The immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) present significant hurdles in tumor therapy. The identification of therapeutic agents that can target both CSCs and the TME could be a potential approach to overcome treatment resistance. Methods We conducted an in vivo chemical screen to identify F1929-1458, which is capable of eliciting an organism-wide response to destroy stem cell tumors in Drosophila. We then performed functional validation using a mouse colorectal cancer graft tumor model established with the CT26 cell line characterized by its high content of CSCs. Single-cell sequencing was employed to analyze alterations in the TME. Small molecule pull-down mass spectrometry, cellular thermal shift assay, drug affinity experiment, and molecular docking were utilized to identify the target of F1929-1458. An in vitro co-culture system was applied to establish that the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by the tumor cells are accountable for the activation of dendritic cells (DCs). Results We demonstrated that F1929-1458 treatment enhanced T cell infiltration and T cell mediated tumor regression, its anti-tumor effect was nullified in nude mice and was abolished after anti-CD3 neutralizing antibody treatment. We found that F1929-1458 binds NFKB1 to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway in tumor cells. The activation further elicits cellular stress, causing tumor cells to release DAMPs (HMGB1-gDNA complex, ATP, and OxLDL). These DAMPs, in turn, stimulate the cGAS-STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in DCs, resulting in the generation of type I IFNs and IL-1β. These cytokines facilitate the maturation of DCs and antigen presentation, ultimately enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, we showed that the combination of F1929-1458 and the anti-PD-1 antibody exhibited a synergistic anti-tumor effect. Conclusion Our study identified a novel NFKB1 agonist that promotes anti-tumor immunity by remodeling the TME and activating DCs and that may provide a new way to overcome resistance to current anti-tumor immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.

        <tr id="Background Major histocompatibility complex class I-related protein A and B (MICA/B) are ligands for the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor and are broadly expressed on tumor cells but minimally on normal tissues. When cytotoxic NKG2D-expressing immune cells engage MICA/B, the ligand-expressing cells are targeted for lysis. Cancer cells can evade NKG2D-mediated destruction by shedding MICA/B from their cell surface via proteases present in the tumor microenvironment. CLN-619 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds MICA/B and inhibits shedding resulting in accumulation of MICA/B on the tumor cell surface. CLN-619 may thereby have therapeutic effects in a broad range of malignancies by re-establishing the MICA/B-NKG2D axis to enable NKG2D-mediated, as well as Fc-gamma receptor-mediated, tumor cell lysis. Methods CLN-619 was characterized for binding epitope and affinity, effects on surface and soluble levels of MICA/B, and in vitro tumor cell killing. In mouse models, the mAb was tested for tumor growth inhibition. The contribution of the Fc-gamma (Fcγ) 1 domain to CLN-619 activity was also assessed. Results CLN-619 bound with high affinity to the alpha-3 domain of MICA/B without encumbering the interaction with NKG2D on natural killer cells. CLN-619 increased the level of cell surface expression of MICA/B and concomitantly decreased the levels of soluble MICA/B in cell culture assays. Treatment of cancer cell lines with CLN-619 induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. CLN-619 resulted in potent inhibition of tumor growth in multiple xenograft models and increased survival of mice in a disseminated cancer model. Conclusions CLN-619 inhibited the shedding of MICA/B to effectively restore cytotoxic signaling pathways in immune cells. Potent antitumor activity of CLN-619 as a monotherapy was observed in several preclinical models. Activity of CLN-619 required a functional Fcγ1 domain, suggesting the requirement of simultaneous engagement of NKG2D and cluster of differentiation 16A (CD16A) on immune cells for optimal cytotoxicity. The preclinical data reported here support the assessment of CLN-619 in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Antibodies against immune checkpoints are now routinely administered as a first line of treatment against metastatic lung cancer. Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors is, however, frequent, underscoring the need to find alternative treatments. Adoptive T-cell therapy has recently proven effective in treating patient’s refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This provides impetus to characterize the T-cell subsets best able to tackle tumors. The anticancer activities of IL-9-producing CD4 T helper cells (TH9 cells) were identified in melanoma in 2012. TH9 cells feature strong antimelanoma effects thanks to their production of interleukin (IL)-9 and the activation of innate and adaptive immune effectors. The ability of TH9 cells to prevent the growth of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and osteosarcoma (OS), which commonly metastasize to the lungs, is elusive. In this commentary, we discuss the findings of Chen et al reported in the JITC demonstrating that TH9 cells are lung-tropic and eliminate TNBC and OS cells developing in the lungs. We also highlight how these investigations are in line with recent studies indicating that the adoptive transfer of IL-9-producing T cells eliminate aggressive cancers, including hematological tumors like leukemia and solid tumors such as glioblastoma. Altogether, these findings over the past 13 years support the clinical evaluation of TH9 cells in the adoptive therapy of cancer.">

        <tr id="The molecular barriers that cause acute xenograft rejection have been identified and addressed by generating genetically modified (GM) animals, knocked out for specific xenoantigens (xenoAgs), and expressing regulatory molecules for both complement and coagulation pathways among others. The focus of xenotransplantation research now lies in delayed xenograft rejection. Dendritic cells (DC) are a specific subpopulation of professional antigen‐presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in the context of organ transplantation. DCs, originating from both the xenograft and the recipient, have the capacity to present xenoAgs to the recipient's immune system via their respective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to rejection. These processes are known as direct and indirect presentation, respectively. However, under certain microenvironmental conditions, DC develops into anti‐inflammatory regulatory cells that can induce immunological tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the general characteristics and functions of DC from species relevant to xenotransplantation, specifically humans, non‐human primates (NHP), and pigs. It will also cover the process of xenoAg presentation, different methods for generating DC with regulatory properties in vitro, and finally, discuss the current strategies for using regulatory DC to improve xenograft acceptance by inducing tolerance.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident immune cells such as innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are known to reside in the parenchymal compartments of tissues and modulate local immune protection. Here we use intravascular cell labeling, parabiosis and multiplex 3D imaging to identify a population of group 3 ILCs in mice that are present within the intravascular space of lung blood vessels (vILC3). vILC3s are distributed broadly in alveolar capillary beds from which inhaled pathogens enter the lung parenchyma. By contrast, conventional ILC3s in tissue parenchyma are enriched in lymphoid clusters in proximity to large veins. In a mouse model of pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection results in rapid vILC3 expansion and production of chemokines including CCL4. Blocking CCL4 in vivo attenuates neutrophil recruitment to the lung at the early stage of infection, resulting in prolonged inflammation and delayed bacterial clearance. Our findings thus define the intravascular space as a site of ILC residence in mice, and reveal a unique immune cell population that interfaces with tissue alarmins and the circulating immune system for timely host defense.">

        <tr id="This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts—such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia—is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules—such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT—are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression—through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation—the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.

        <tr id="Background Antigen-specific immunotherapy shows potential for inducing long-term immune tolerance in type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet its clinical application is hampered by uncertainty regarding dominant epitopes. Conversely, non-antigen-specific treatments such as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) present a more straightforward approach but struggle to maintain tolerance after treatment. Addressing these issues is critical for advancing T1D therapies. Methods The phenotypic and metabolic properties of two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells were analyzed in both humans and NOD mice. T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity and Bulk RNA sequencing provided insights into the transcriptomic profiles and TCR reactivity of these cells. Mechanistic studies were conducted using the HEK-293 T cell line and primary cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to evaluate the characteristics of different CD8+ T cell subsets following two types of immunotherapies. In NY8.3 mice, the effect of mitochondrial fission inhibitors on immunotherapy results was evaluated. Final validation was carried out with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1D patients. Results Our study reveals the diversity of two distinct exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets in T1D through flow cytometry, highlighting unique clinical features, phenotypes, and functions. Notable differences in TCR reactivity and metabolic pathways between these subsets were identified through TCR sequencing and transcriptomic analyses in NOD mice. Both antigen-specific and non-antigen-specific stimuli produced unique exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets. Our research identified leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) as a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, influencing the interconversion of exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets by phosphorylating dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at serine 637 (Ser637) and serine 616 (Ser616). scRNA-seq confirmed that antigen-specific immunotherapy effectively suppresses T cell signaling, induces exhaustion, and promotes the development of terminally exhausted T (TEX) cells. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti-CD3 mAb treatment by promoting the development of more TEX cells. Conclusions Our results point to a new immunotherapeutic approach that targets exhausted CD8+ T cells’ energy metabolism, offering valuable insights for advancing clinical strategies in T1D therapy.

With growing interest in their potential for cancer immunotherapy, a comprehensive and inclusive exploration of γδ T cell families, their development, activation mechanisms, functions, therapeutic implications, and current treatments is essential. This review aims to provide an inclusive and thorough discussion of these topics. Through our discussion, we seek to uncover insights that may harbinger innovative immunotherapeutic strategies. Beginning with an overview of γδ T cell families including Vδ1, Vδ2, and Vδ3, this review highlights their distinct functional properties and contributions to anti-tumor immunity. Despite γδ T cells exhibiting both anti-tumor and pro-tumor activities, our review elucidates strategies to harness the anti-tumor potential of γδ T cells for therapeutic benefit. Moreover, our paper discusses the structural intricacies of the γδ T cell receptor and its significance in tumor recognition. Additionally, this review examines conventional and emerging γδ T cell therapies, encompassing both non-engineered and engineered approaches, with a focus on their efficacy and safety profiles in clinical trials. From multifunctional capabilities to diverse tissue distribution, γδ T cells play a pivotal role in immune regulation and surveillance. By analyzing current research findings, this paper offers insights into the dynamic landscape of γδ T cell–based immunotherapies, underscoring their promise as a potent armamentarium against cancer. Furthermore, by dissecting the complex biology of γδ T cells, we learn valuable information about the anti-cancer contributions of γδ T cells, as well as potential targets for immunotherapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="T cell exhaustion is a critical obstacle for durable treatment response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Developing drugs that control tumor growth and simultaneously bolster immune function is of great significance. Although high-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) has been reported to be crucial to HCC prognosis, its role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Here, we found HMGB2+ CD8+ T cells as being associated with immune exhaustion and resistance to anti–PD-1 treatment through single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistically, HMGB2 impaired the oxidative phosphorylation in CD8+ T cells and inactivated the interferon-γ response in tumor cells, reducing the antitumor effector function. Tannic acid, a specific inhibitor of HMGB2, synergized with PD-1 antibody to attenuate tumor growth and reverse T cell exhaustion. Our findings highlight the unique role of HMGB2 as an immune exhaustion associated molecule. Targeting HMGB2 on both CD8+ T cells and tumor cells contributed to promising treatment strategies for HCC.">

        <tr id="Tumor tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), especially mature TLS (mTLS), have been associated with better prognosis and improved responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, by performing single-cell RNA, antigen receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics on tumor tissue from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients with different statuses of TLS, we observe that mTLS are enriched with stem-like T cells, and B cells at various maturation stages. Notably, progenitor exhausted CD4+ T cells, with features resembling follicular helper T cells, support these responses, by activating B cells to produce plasma cells in the germinal center, and interacting with DC-LAMP+ dendritic cells to support CD8+ T cell activation. Conversely, non-mTLS tumors do not promote local anti-tumor immunity which is abundant of immunosuppressive cells or a lack of stem-like B and T cells. Furthermore, patients with mTLS manifest improved overall survival and response to ICB compared to those with non-mTLS. Overall, our study provides insights into mechanisms underlying mTLS-mediated intra-tumoral immunity events against cancer.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke (IS) is a significant contributor to disability and death worldwide, with limited treatments beyond early intervention. The importance of CD4+ T cells in the advancement of IS has been highlighted by recent studies, providing new insights into immunomodulatory strategies. This review describes the spatiotemporal dynamics of CD4+ T cells and their subsets at different stages of IS. The signaling pathways activated by IS regulate the distribution of CD4+ T cells and their subsets, which further influences the inflammatory response and disease progression. In the acute and subacute stages, CD4+ T cells exacerbate neuronal damage. In contrast, CD4+ T cells, which are predominantly composed of Treg cells (Tregs), promote tissue repair and neurological recovery in the chronic stage. In light of recent findings that challenge traditional views, we analyze the underlying mechanisms and potential explanations for these discrepancies. In addition, we summarize the potential of targeting CD4+ T cells as a therapeutic strategy for IS. Although no drugs specifically targeting CD4+ T cells have been developed, certain drugs that modulate CD4+ T cells show potential for IS treatment. Moreover, multitarget drugs integrated with nanomaterials are currently undergoing preclinical investigation. We further explore the challenges in the clinical translation of CD4+ T-cell-targeted therapies and discuss potential strategies to address these challenges. In conclusion, a deeper comprehension of the complex effects of CD4+ T cells and their subsets on IS will contribute to disease management and drug development, thereby improving the quality of life for IS patients.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are characterized by irregular immune responses that disrupt self-tolerance. This research explores the effects of the immunomodulatory drug celecoxib on the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Key receptors, including CTLA-4, VISTA, BTLA, PDL-1, B7H7, and LAG3, play critical roles in initiating and regulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of immune checkpoints in preventing autoimmune conditions, with animal research supporting their effectiveness in immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that the upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors can enhance the inhibitory functions of DCs, thereby promoting self-tolerance. As a result, tolerogenic DCs present a promising therapeutic avenue for treating autoimmune diseases. Although these results are promising, further trials are required to validate this approach before it can be applied clinically. This study underscores the potential of targeting immune checkpoint receptors as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disorders.">

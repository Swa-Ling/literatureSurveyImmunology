        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever, is an emerging respiratory disease caused by soil dwelling fungi of the Coccidioides genus that is expected to spread from the southwest into the central U.S. by 2050. While 60% of infections are asymptomatic, the other 40% of patients experience a range of symptoms, from self-limiting pneumonia to life-threatening disseminated disease. The immunological events that underlie the progression to severe disease remain under defined. Here, we probed the early immune response to Coccidioides using a high dose of an attenuated strain of C. posadasii in a mouse model of infection coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing. At 24 hours post-infection, robust immune infiltration is detected in the lung, marked by high levels of inflammatory PD-L1+ neutrophils and fungal-contact dependent pro-fibrotic Spp1+ macrophages. These findings elucidate the early dynamics of the host response to Coccidioides and provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the lung. Importance By examining early immune dynamics in the lungs, we uncover critical insights into how myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, are recruited and differentiated during Coccidioides infection. The discovery of specific immune cell subsets, such as PD-L1+ neutrophils and Spp1+ macrophages, which are associated with inflammation and fibrosis, highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that occur during Coccidioides infection, offering valuable directions for developing more effective treatments and preventive strategies against this increasingly prevalent disease.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Yellow fever vaccination provides long-lasting protection and is a unique model for studying the immune response to an acute RNA virus infection in humans. To elucidate the early innate immune events preceding the rapid generation of protective immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of human blood dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subpopulations before and 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after vaccination. We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on day 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type specific responses and temporal dynamics. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees. We identified SIGLEC1/CD169 upregulation as a sensitive indicator of the transient IFN-induced activation state elicited in DCs and monocytes by YF17D vaccination correlating with early protective IgM antibody responses.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus. Previous studies have shown antibody Fc effector functions are critical for optimal monoclonal antibody-mediated protection against alphaviruses; however, the requirement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) for protection during natural infection has not been evaluated. Here, we showed mice lacking activating FcγRs (FcRγ-/-) developed prolonged clinical disease with more virus in joint-associated tissues. Viral clearance was associated with anti-MAYV cell surface binding rather than neutralizing antibodies. Lack of Fc-FcγR engagement increased the number of monocytes through chronic timepoints. Single cell RNA sequencing showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes in joint-associated tissue with increased MAYV RNA present in FcRγ-/- monocytes and macrophages. Transfer of FcRγ-/- monocytes into wild type animals was sufficient to increase virus in joint-associated tissue. Overall, this study suggests that engagement of antibody Fc with activating FcγRs promotes protective responses during MAYV infection and prevents monocytes from being potential targets of infection.">

        <tr id="The adjuvant AS01 plays a key role in the immunogenicity of several approved human vaccines with demonstrated high efficacy. Its adjuvant effect relies on activation of the innate immune system. However, specific effects of AS01-adjuvanted vaccines on innate cell function and epigenetic remodeling, as described for Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and influenza vaccines, are still unknown. We assessed the long-term functional and epigenetic changes in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells induced by a model vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen and AS01 in healthy adults (NCT01777295). The AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, but not an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine, increased the number of circulating monocytes and their expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DR, which correlated with the magnitude of the memory CD4+ T cell response. Single-cell analyses revealed epigenetic alterations in monocyte and dendritic cell subsets, affecting accessibility of transcription factors involved in cell functions including activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA, C/EBP, and interferon regulatory factor. The functional changes were characterized by a reduced proinflammatory response to Toll-like receptor activation and an improved response to interferon-γ, a cytokine critical for the adjuvant’s mode of action. Epigenetic changes were most evident shortly after the second vaccine dose in CD14+ monocytes, for which accessibility differences of some transcription factors could persist for up to 6 months postvaccination. Together, we show that reprogramming of monocyte subsets occurs after vaccination with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, an effect that may contribute to the impact of vaccination beyond antigen-specific protection. An AS01-adjuvanted vaccine for hepatitis B virus modifies the epigenetic landscape of monocytes isolated from clinical study participants. Editor’s summary Most vaccines based on recombinant antigens rely on coadministration with an adjuvant to elicit a robust immune response. Although adjuvants are needed for many vaccines, it is less clear which adjuvant(s) should be paired with each immunogen. In two papers, Bechtold et al. and Arunachalam et al. performed comparative analyses to assess the effect of different adjuvants on the immune response. Bechtold et al. showed that an AS01-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus vaccine, which induces robust CD4+ T cell responses against the vaccine antigen, also elicited trained immunity in human recipients, which was not observed in an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine. Arunachalam et al. found that Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum adjuvantation induced robust immune responses to the R21 malaria vaccine in nonhuman primates, but a third comparator, GLA-LSQ, elicited a lower magnitude of response that was short lived. Although Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum induced robust and durable antibody responses, they elicited distinct innate immune responses, demonstrating that multiple innate immune mechanisms can program durable vaccine-induced immunity. These head-to-head comparisons in both humans and nonhuman primates demonstrate that selecting an adjuvant should be done carefully and that different adjuvants have distinct effects on both innate and adaptive immunity. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

Single cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that NT CD4 TRM are heterogeneous and transcriptionally distinct as compared to their lung counterparts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the CXCR6- CXCL16 axis is involved in CD4 TRM residency in the NT. Furthermore, we show that the NT of mice and humans contains a high frequency of IL-17-producing CD4 TRM that aid in local viral clearance and in reducing tissue damage. Collectively, our results support a robust physiological role for nasal tissue CD4 TRM in preventing IAV infection.">

Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) presented clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Lack of ICI efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells that create the “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) impeding infiltration and activation of effector T cells. We developed a designer RGD peptide that hindered glioma-instigated, integrin-mediated pro-tumoral reprogramming of myeloid cells and blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in co-cultures in vitro. Intratumorally-delivered RGD alone did not reduce glioma growth in syngeneic mice but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and led to peritumoral blood vessels normalization. Furthermore, combining RGD with immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade reduced tumor growth, led to upsurge of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depleted regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. RGD modified the phenotypes of myeloid cells in human gliomas in nude mice. Thus, combining the integrin blockade with ICI reinvigorates antitumor immunity and paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.">

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Atherosclerotic plaques are defined by the accumulation of lipids and immune cells beneath the endothelium of the arterial intima. CD8 T cells are among the most abundant immune cell types in plaque, and conditions linked to their activation correlate with increased levels of cardiovascular disease. As lethal effectors of the immune response, CD8 T cell activation is suppressed at multiple levels. These checkpoints are critical in dampening autoimmune responses, and limiting damage in cardiovascular disease. Endothelial cells are well known for their role in recruiting CD8 T and other hematopoietic cells to low and disturbed flow (LDF) arterial regions that develop plaque, but whether they locally influence CD8 effector functions is unclear. Here, we show that endothelial cells can actively suppress CD8 T cell responses in settings of chronic plaque inflammation, but that this behavior is governed by expression of the RNA-binding protein Embryonic Lethal, Abnormal Vision-Like 1 (Elavl1). In response to immune cell recruitment in plaque, the endothelium dynamically shifts splicing of pre-mRNA and their translation to enhance expression of immune-regulatory proteins including C1q and CD27. This program is immuno-suppressive, and limited by Elavl1. We show this by Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2-mediated deletion of Elavl1 (ECKO), and analysis of changes in translation by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP). In ECKO mice, the translational shift in chronic inflammation is enhanced, leading to increased ribosomal association of C1q components and other critical regulators of immune response and resulting in a ∼70% reduction in plaque CD8 T cells. CITE-seq analysis of the remaining plaque T cells shows that they exhibit lower levels of markers associated with T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, survival, and activation. To understand whether the immunosuppressive mechanism occurred through failed CD8 recruitment or local modulation of T cell responses, we used a novel in vitro co-culture system to show that ECKO endothelial cells suppress CD8 T cell expansion—even in the presence of wild-type myeloid antigen-presenting cells, antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and antigen. Despite the induction of C1q mRNA by T cell co-culture in both wild-type and ECKO endothelial cells, we find C1q protein abundantly expressed only in co-culture with ECKO cells. Together, our data define a novel immune-suppressive transition in the endothelium, reminiscent of the transition of T cells to T-regs, and demonstrate the regulation of this process by Elavl1.">

        <tr id="Waning immunity and the emergence of immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants jeopardize vaccine efficacy leading to breakthrough infections. We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing, we defined changes in gene expression associated with inflammation at 1-day post-wounding (dpw) in mouse skin. Compared to keratinocytes and myeloid cells, we detected enriched expression of pro-inflammatory genes in fibroblasts associated with deeper layers of the skin. In particular, SCA1+ fibroblasts were enriched for numerous chemokines, including CCL2, CCL7, and IL33 compared to SCA1-fibroblasts. Genetic deletion of Ccl2 in fibroblasts resulted in fewer wound bed macrophages and monocytes during injury-induced inflammation with reduced revascularization and re-epithelialization during the proliferation phase of healing. These findings highlight the important contribution of deep skin fibroblast-derived factors to injury-induced inflammation and the impact of immune cell dysregulation on subsequent tissue repair.">

Here, we have used a mouse model to track GC-derived B cells with integrative single-cell and spatial analyses in draining lymph node after immunization. We first identified putative prePC in scRNA-seq datasets, then enriched those cells through their specific surface phenotype for further analysis of their gene expression trajectories and BCR repertoire. We found a continuum of actively proliferating transitional states bridging selected LZ GC B cells and recently exported PCs, with gradually increasing levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated genes and immunoglobulin transcripts. Spatial analyses revealed that recently differentiated PC continued their maturation and proliferation at the interface between the DZ and extensions of the lymph node medulla. Our results provide insights into the intermediate stages and microenvironmental factors involved in the differentiation of GC B cells into PC, with implications for vaccine development and understanding antibody responses.">

        <tr id="Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) represent an urgent public health challenge and are estimated to affect more than 60 million individuals globally. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood-based studies, with few focusing on samples derived from affected tissues. Furthermore, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal mechanisms. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we comprehensively compared bronchoalveolar lavage fluid single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from clinical PASC samples and a mouse model of PASC. This revealed a pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC, as well as abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells, in both humans and mice. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in respiratory PASC. Neutralizing IFN-γ after the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced lung inflammation and tissue fibrosis in mice. Together, our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the cause of PASC and suggests that the IFN-γ signaling axis might represent a therapeutic target. Comparative scRNA-seq analysis, combined with functional experiments in an animal model, identified IFN-γ as a target for respiratory PASC. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a myriad of symptoms that a person may experience after an acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also referred to as postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The specific drivers of these symptoms are unclear, complicating the development of therapeutics for those suffering from this condition. Here, Li et al. used comparative analysis to interrogate a potential driver of respiratory PASC, one of the most debilitating types of PASC. The authors found that humans with respiratory PASC had evidence of an enhanced monocyte-derived macrophage response in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A similar phenotype was observed in aged C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. This phenotype in mice could be reduced by anti–interferon-γ (anti–IFN-γ) treatment initiated after the resolution of acute disease, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for humans. —Courtney Malo">

Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6.

Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology.

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated durable responses in various cancer types, a significant proportion of patients do not exhibit favourable responses to these interventions. To uncover potential factors associated with a positive response to immunotherapy, we established a bilateral tumor model using P815 mastocytoma implanted in DBA/2 mice. In this model, only a fraction of tumor-bearing mice responds favourably to anti-PD-1 treatment, thus providing a valuable model to explore the influence of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in determining the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based immunotherapies. Moreover, this model allows for the analysis of a pretreatment tumor and inference of its treatment outcome based on the response observed in the contralateral tumor. Here, we demonstrated that tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell clones expressing high levels of Tim-3 were associated to a positive anti-tumor response following anti-PD-1 administration. Our study also revealed distinct differentiation dynamics in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in responding and non-responding mice. An IFNγ-enriched TME appeared to promote the differentiation of monocytes into PD-L1pos MHC IIhigh cells in mice responding to immunotherapy. Monocytes present in the TME of non-responding mice failed to reach the same final stage of differentiation trajectory, suggesting that an altered monocyte to macrophage route may hamper the response to ICB. These insights will direct future research towards a temporal analysis of TAMs, aiming to identify factors responsible for transitions between differentiation states within the TME. This approach may potentially pave the way to novel strategies to enhance the efficacy of PD-1 blockade.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Effective cancer immunotherapy relies on the clonal proliferation and expansion of CD8+ T cells in the tumor1,2. However, our insights into clonal expansions are limited, owing to an inability to track the same clones in tumors over time. Here, we developed a multi-tumor mouse model system to track hundreds of expanding and contracting CD8+ T cell clones over multiple timepoints in tumors of the same individual. Through coupling of clonal expansion dynamics and single-cell RNA/TCR-seq data, we identified a transcriptomic signature in PD-1+Ly108+ precursor exhausted cells3,4 that strongly predicts rates of intratumoral clone expansion in mice and humans. We found that expression of the signature successfully stratifies melanoma patient outcomes to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade5,6. Downregulation of the signature precedes clone contraction – a phase in which clones contract but maintain revivable precursor exhausted cells in the tumor. LAG-3 blockade – an FDA-approved therapy whose effects on CD8+ T cell responses are currently unclear7, re-activates the expansion signature, re-expanding pre-existing clones, including previously contracted clones. These findings reveal how the study of clonal expansion dynamics provide a powerful ‘pan-immunotherapy’ signature for monitoring immunotherapies, including PD-1/PD-L1 and LAG-3 blockade, with implications for their future development.">

        <tr id="Exhaustion represents a collection of programmed T cell differentiation states and an important mode of T cell dysfunction. T cell progression from progenitor to terminal exhaustion is associated with upregulation of the transcription factor TOX and expression of TIM3. Our understanding of factors regulating TOX expression and the transition from progenitor to terminal exhaustion, however, remains incomplete. We reveal here that T cell upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (TNFR2) coincides with the gain of phenotypic markers and functions reflective of terminal exhaustion. Meanwhile, knocking out TNFR2 affords a novel population of T cells that express TIM3 but possess diminished TOX levels and functional characteristics of both progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. TIM3+ TNFR2 KO T cells exhibit reduced exhaustion transcriptional programs and enhanced AP1 pathway signatures. Finally, TNFR2 KO mice demonstrate improved T cell-dependent control of tumor and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral (cLCMV) infection, while pharmacologic antagonism of TNFR2 licenses responses to checkpoint blockade in multiple tumor models.">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Current rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments do not restore immune tolerance. Investigating dendritic cell (DC) populations in human synovial tissue (ST) may reveal pathways to re-instate tolerance in RA. With single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics of synovial tissue biopsies, validated by micro co-culture systems, we identified condition and niche-specific myeloid DC clusters with distinct differentiation trajectories and functions. Healthy synovium contains a unique tolerogenic AXLpos DC2 cluster in the superficial sublining layer. In active RA, a macrophage-rich lining-layer niche becomes populated with inflammatory DC3 clusters that specifically activate memory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5posCXCL13pos TPH, promoting synovitis. In the sublining lymphoid niche, CCR7pos DC2 mReg specifically interact with naïve-T-cells, potentially driving the local expansion of new effector T-cells. Sustained remission sees the resolution of these niches but lacks the recovery of tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, indicating latent potential for disease flare. A human RA disease-flare model showed that the activation of blood predecessor of ST-DC3 clusters precedes the onset of inflammation in joints. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenic ST-DC3 clusters, or reinstating tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, may restore immune homeostasis in RA. In brief Deconstruction of human RA synovium, using single-cell spatial transcriptomics and micro-culture systems, reveals distinct neighbourhoods within the synovial architecture across health, and RA patients with active disease or sustained remission. Discrete niches are identified that contain distinct myeloid DC clusters that differ in frequency, differentiation trajectories, and effector functions. Highlights Human RA synovium exhibits condition and niche specific myeloid DC clusters that vary in their tissue differentiation trajectories and functions.

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) are essential for regional immunity in non-lymphoid tissues. Although single-cell transcriptomics have revealed Trm heterogeneity in various diseases, the molecular mechanisms behind this diversity are unclear. To investigate this, we used Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection, which persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and is controlled by brain CD8+ Trm. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that Id2-deficiency in T cells caused parasite-specific Trm to develop an altered phenotype with diminished effector functions and reduced expression of CD49a. Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Immunotherapeutics targeting T cells are crucial for inhibiting autoimmune disease progression proximal to disease onset in type 1 diabetes. A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

        <tr id="Abstract The regulation of inflammation is a critical aspect of disease tolerance and naturally acquired clinical immunity to malaria. Here, we demonstrate using RNA sequencing and epigenetic landscape profiling by cytometry by time-of-flight, that the regulation of inflammatory pathways during asymptomatic parasitemia occurs downstream of pathogen sensing—at the epigenetic level. The abundance of certain epigenetic markers (methylation of H3K27 and dimethylation of arginine residues) and decreased prevalence of histone variant H3.3 correlated with suppressed cytokine responses among monocytes of Ugandan children. Such an epigenetic signature was observed across diverse immune cell populations and not only characterized active asymptomatic parasitemia but also correlated with future long-term disease tolerance and clinical immunity when observed in uninfected children. Pseudotime analyses revealed a potential trajectory of epigenetic change that correlated with a child's age and recent parasite exposure and paralleled the acquisition of clinical immunity. Thus, our data support a model whereby exposure to Plasmodium falciparum induces epigenetic changes that regulate excessive inflammation and contribute to naturally acquire clinical immunity to malaria.">

Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

This study investigates the relationship between West Nile Virus infection and microglial senescence, focusing on the role of LGALS3BP, a protein implicated in both antiviral responses and aging. Using spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we characterized changes in microglial gene signatures in adult and aged mice following recovery from WNV encephalitis. Additionally, we analyzed Lgals3bp expression and generated Lgals3bp-deficient mice to assess the impact on neuroinflammation and microglial phenotypes. Our results show that WNV-activated microglia share transcriptional signatures with aged microglia, including upregulation of genes involved in interferon response and inflammation. Lgals3bp was broadly expressed in the CNS and robustly upregulated during WNV infection and aging. Lgals3bp-deficient mice exhibited reduced neuroinflammation, increased homeostatic microglial numbers, and altered T cell populations without differences in virologic control or survival. These data indicate that LGALS3BP has a role in regulating neuroinflammation and microglial activation and suggest that targeting LGALS3BP might provide a potential route for mitigating neuroinflammation-related cognitive decline in aging and post-viral infections.">

        <tr id="IL-23 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the cellular targets and signaling pathways affected by this cytokine remain poorly understood. We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="In murine models of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), parasitization of resident Kupffer cells (resKCs) is responsible for early growth of Leishmania infantum in the liver, which leads to granuloma formation and eventual parasite control. We employed the chronic VL model, and revealed an open niche established by KCs death and their migration outside of the sinusoids, resulting in their gradual replacement by monocyte-derived KCs (moKCs). While early granulomas were composed of resKCs, late granulomas were found outside of the sinusoids and contained resKC-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived macrophages (momacs). ResKCs and moKCs within the sinusoids were identified as homeostatic/regulatory cells, while resKC-derived macrophages and momacs within late granulomas were pro-inflammatory. Despite the infection being largely confined to the resKC-derived macrophages, in the absence of monocyte recruitment, parasite control was strongly compromised. Macrophage heterogeneity, involving migration and reprogramming of resKCs, along with recruitment of monocyte-derived cells, is a hallmark of granuloma maturation and hepatic immunity in VL.">

However, the ability of CD4+ T cells to suppress Mtb growth cannot be fully explained by IFN-γ or other known T cell products. In this study, we show that CD4+ T cell-derived IFN-γ promoted the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. Although the recruited MDMs became quickly and preferentially infected with Mtb, CD4+ T cells rapidly disinfected the MDMs. Clearance of Mtb from MDMs was not explained by IFN-γ, but rather by MHCII-mediated cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells. These interactions promoted MDM expression of glycolysis genes essential for Mtb control. Thus, by recruiting MDMs, CD4+ T cells initiate a cycle of bacterial phagocytosis, Mtb antigen presentation and disinfection in an attempt to clear the bacteria from the lungs.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and a high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem leading to permanently disfiguring skin lesions caused by Leishmania parasites. Lesion severity stems from an excessive host inflammatory response that prevents healing. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and translational responses of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during murine CL using historical single-cell RNA sequencing data combined with flow cytometry and in vivo puromycin incorporation to assess translational activity. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation pathways including MHC-I, MHC-II, and immunoproteasome transcripts in dermal LECs from Leishmania major-infected mice compared to naive controls. LECs also exhibited increased expression of guanylate binding proteins and interferon-inducible genes, indicative of immune activation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that LECs in leishmanial lesions displayed heightened translational activity relative to LECs from uninflamed ears, and LEC translational activity was highest in activated LECs. Furthermore, LEC translational activity exceeded that of other cell types within the lesion microenvironment. Validating the transcriptomic data, LECs in lesions expressed elevated MHC-II and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), supporting their potential role in antigen presentation. Functional assays using DQ-OVA confirmed that LECs from leishmanial lesions efficiently uptake and process antigens, highlighting their capability as antigen presenting cells in the inflamed dermal microenvironment. Overall, our study reveals the activation status of LECs in leishmanial lesions, shedding light on their potential role in shaping local immunity and inflammation in a variety of skin diseases.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

        <tr id="In chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-resident self-reactive T cells perpetuate disease. The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS. This finding introduces tissue factors as a novel category of immune targets for treating chronic CNS autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced cell death is a key contributor to COVID-19 pathology. Cell death induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well studied in myeloid cells but less in its primary host cell type, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing human airway epithelia (HAE). SARS-CoV-2 induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in HAE organotypic cultures. Single-cell and limiting-dilution analysis revealed that necroptosis is the primary cell death event in infected cells, whereas uninfected bystanders undergo apoptosis, and pyroptosis occurs later during infection. Mechanistically, necroptosis is induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA–binding protein 1 (ZBP1) in HAE and lung tissues from patients with COVID-19. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, which causes more severe disease than Omicron (B1.1.529) in humans, is associated with orders of magnitude–greater Z-RNA/ZBP1 interactions, necroptosis, and disease severity in animal models. Thus, Delta induces robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis and more disease severity. Z-RNA/ZBP1–induced necroptosis is an initiating cell death event that occurs markedly more with Delta than Omicron infection. Editor’s summary SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers multiple cell death pathways that contribute to disease severity. Here, Liang et al. characterized cell death mechanisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing cells and primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in autopsied lungs from patients with COVID-19. Necroptosis was the primary form of cell death and was induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP-1). Infected and bystander cells underwent apoptosis, but limiting dilution analysis showed that apoptosis was a bystander effect.

        <tr id="Soil-transmitted helminths are one of the most common infections across the world, yet how to promote an effective humoral response to helminths is not well understood. To ensure the most effective response, molecular programs underpin the specialization of antibody effector subtype to microenvironmental signals. Here, we identify the methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) as a key target to promote IgA-driven responses. Mll1 was increased in germinal center (GC) B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and the absence of MLL1 in mature B cells led to significant reductions in GCs, IgG1 and IgE in response to the helminth Trichuris muris. Yet, worm expulsion occurred more rapidly in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice compared to control mice in the first two weeks of infection. Accelerated worm clearance correlated with significantly elevated IgA+ plasma cells (PC), serum IgA and fecal IgA in in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice. Stimulation of B cells in vitro confirmed that Mll1-deficiency accelerated the formation of IgA+ PC and that this effect was B cell-intrinsic. CCR9 was identified as a key MLL1-regulated molecule by RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry. Correspondingly, Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice infected with either T. muris or the bacterium C. rodentium significant increased IgA+CCR9+ PC localized in the large intestine. This tailoring of the B cell response to promote IgA-secreting PC correlated to a healthier microbiome in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice, compared to control mice. Thus, this study reveals MLL1 as a key target to tailor B cell responses to helminth infections, which may aid the development of effective mucosal vaccines or new targeted treatments. Significance statement Diseases caused by infections, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections or bacterial infections, continue to pose a major human health problem worldwide. One key reason why soil-transmitted helminths continue to cause long-term health and economic burdens is the lack of an effective vaccine for human use. Antibody responses underpin most successful vaccine designs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how B cell responses are regulated to produce tailored antibody to different pathogens is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. This study uncovered MLL1 as a novel therapeutic target to promote IgA-producing plasma cells, opening new avenues of investigation into how effective and tailored antibody responses may be produced in response to bacterial or helminth infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract A comprehensive immune landscape for Brucella infection is crucial for developing new treatments for brucellosis. Here, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of 290,369 cells from 35 individuals, including 29 brucellosis patients from acute (n = 10), sub‐acute (n = 9), and chronic (n = 10) phases as well as six healthy donors. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were applied for validation within this cohort. Brucella infection caused a significant change in the composition of peripheral immune cells and inflammation was a key feature of brucellosis. Acute patients are characterized by potential cytokine storms resulting from systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, primarily due to classical monocytes. Cytokine storm may be mediated by activating S100A8/A9‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, monocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells were the probable contributors to immune paralysis in acute patients. Chronic patients are characterized by a dysregulated Th1 response, marked by reduced expression of IFN‐γ and Th1 signatures as well as a high exhausted state. Additionally, Brucella infection can suppress apoptosis in myeloid cells (e.g., mDCs, classical monocytes), inhibit antigen presentation in professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs; e.g., mDC) and nonprofessional APCs (e.g., monocytes), and induce exhaustion in CD8+ T/NK cells, potentially resulting in the establishment of chronic infection. Overall, our study systemically deciphered the coordinated immune responses of Brucella at different phases of the infection, which facilitated a full understanding of the immunopathogenesis of brucellosis and may aid the development of new effective therapeutic strategies, especially for those with chronic infection.">

Here, we explored LN-associated histological, immunological, and virological mechanisms of bNAb generation in a cohort of anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naïve PLWH. We found that participants who produce bNAbs, termed neutralizers, have a superior LN-associated B cell follicle architecture compared with PLWH who do not. The latter was associated with a significantly higher in situ prevalence of Bcl-6hi follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH), expressing a molecular program that favors their differentiation and stemness, and significantly reduced IL-10 follicular suppressor CD4 T cells. Furthermore, our data reveal possible molecular targets mediating TFH-B cell interactions in neutralizers.

        <tr id="Fibrosis in the lung is thought to be driven by epithelial cell dysfunction and aberrant cell-cell interactions. Unveiling the molecular mechanisms of cellular plasticity and cell-cell interactions is imperative to elucidating lung regenerative capacity and aberrant repair in pulmonary fibrosis. By mining publicly available RNA-Seq data sets, we identified loss of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) as a candidate contributor to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We used conditional KO mice, scRNA-Seq, lung organoids, small-molecule inhibition, and potentially novel gene manipulation methods to investigate the role of CEBPA in lung fibrosis and repair. Long-term (6 months or more) of Cebpa loss in AT2 cells caused spontaneous fibrosis and increased susceptibility to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Cebpa knockout (KO) in these mice significantly decreased AT2 cell numbers in the lung and reduced expression of surfactant homeostasis genes, while increasing inflammatory cell recruitment as well as upregulating S100a8/a9 in AT2 cells. In vivo treatment with an S100A8/A9 inhibitor alleviated experimental lung fibrosis. Restoring CEBPA expression in lung organoids ex vivo and during experimental lung fibrosis in vivo rescued CEBPA deficiency–mediated phenotypes. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between CEBPA repression, impaired AT2 cell identity, disrupted tissue homeostasis, and lung fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Intra‐tumour immune infiltration is a crucial determinant affecting immunotherapy response in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its phenotype and related spatial structure have remained elusive. To overcome these restrictions, we undertook a comprehensive study comprising spatial transcriptomic (ST) data (28 712 spots from six samples). We identified two distinct intra‐tumour infiltration patterns: immune exclusion (characterised by myeloid cells) and immune activation (characterised by plasma cells). The immune exclusion and immune activation signatures showed adverse and favourable roles in NSCLC patients' survival, respectively. Notably, CD14+APOE+ cells were recognised as the main cell type in immune exclusion samples, with increased epithelial‒mesenchymal transition and decreased immune activities. The co‐location of CD14+APOE+ cells and MMP7+ tumour cells was observed in both ST and bulk transcriptomics data, validated by multiplex immunofluorescence performed on 20 NSCLC samples. The co‐location area exhibited the upregulation of proliferation‐related pathways and hypoxia activities. This co‐localisation inhibited T‐cell infiltration and the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures. Both CD14+APOE+ cells and MMP7+ tumour cells were associated with worse survival. In an immunotherapy cohort from the ORIENT‐3 clinical trial, NSCLC patients who responded unfavourably exhibited higher infiltration of CD14+APOE+ cells and MMP7+ tumour cells. Within the co‐location area, the MK, SEMA3 and Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) signalling pathway was most active in cell‒cell communication. This study identified immune exclusion and activation patterns in NSCLC and the co‐location of CD14+APOE+ cells and MMP7+ tumour cells as contributors to immune resistance.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs) are highly abundant myeloid cells in gliomas, with their phenotype and immune response determined by ontogeny and microenvironment. TAMs display distinctive transcriptional programs according to the IDH mutation status but the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Herein, we uncover that CD11B+ myeloid cells in human IDHmut gliomas exhibit DNA hypermethylation predominantly at distal enhancers. This hypermethylation was linked to decreased expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses and glycolytic metabolism, and the inactivation of transcription factors that regulate microglial responses to environmental stimuli. Prolonged exposure of human primary microglia to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) inhibited TET-mediated 5mC oxidation, resulting in a reduced accumulation of global 5hmC levels. We confirmed high 5mC/5hmC ratios at lineage-specific enhancers, by analyzing CpGs at single-base resolution. D-2HG-treated microglia show reduced proinflammatory capacity and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, consistent with the remodeled enhancer landscape. Conversely, depletion of D-2HG following treatment of a glioma patient with an IDH mutant inhibitor was associated with enhanced microglial responses, as assessed by snRNA-seq. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the hyporesponsive state of microglia in IDHmut gliomas and support the concept that oncometabolites may disrupt the function of immune cells residing in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

In this study, we report the novel finding that co-infection with influenza/A/X31 protects mice from death by Plasmodium berghei NK65-Edinburgh, a model of severe malarial pulmonary leak which underpins malaria-associated acute lung injury (MA-ALI) and malaria-associated acute respiratory distress (MA-ARDS). Co-infected mice exhibit equivalent parasitemia as mice with malaria only, suggesting that the survival phenotype is due to differences in immune kinetics. We demonstrated that the pulmonary leak typical of PbE is attenuated in co-infected mice without alteration in CD8 T cell activation and recruitment to the lung. Upon further examination of the immune response to influenza/A/X31 we identified a population of arginase 1-expressing alveolar macrophages that traffic to the lungs early during infection. In vitro these macrophages inhibit CD8 T cell activation and proliferation better than non-arginase expressing cells. Removal of arginase-1 expressing alveolar macrophages in vivo via administration of the antimetabolite gemcitabine removed the protective effects of influenza/A/X31co-infection on MA-ALI. This study opens a route to better understanding of how to modulate the immunopathology observed in pulmonary leak associated with severe malaria, which must be achieved to rationally design therapeutic interventions for MA-ARDS / MA-ALI.">

        <tr id="Introduction Biological processes such as aging, carcinogenesis, and immune response rely on the ability to maintain or rapidly expand cell populations. The fitness of the involved cells is constrained by their replicative potential, which is reflected in the cellular telomere content. Method We apply TelomereHunter to scATAC-seq data to determine telomere content on single-cell level, in a hematopoietic dataset consisting of 35,139 cells from samples of basal cell carcinoma patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade treatment. Integrating information from open-chromatin-based signatures to assess cell identity, we characterize the heterogeneity of telomere length for individual cell populations pre- and post-immunotherapy. Results The extracted telomeric reads reflect the expected telomereome-to-genome fraction. Telomere content distributions differ significantly between cell populations, and the median telomere content in intermediate and terminal exhausted CD8+ T-cells pre-treatment is significantly correlated to response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Likewise, telomere content correlates with post-treatment cell proliferation in terminally exhausted and T follicular helper cells from responding patients. Conclusion Telomere content measurement from scATAC-seq data has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to detect significant differences between cell types. Furthermore, the telomere content of CD8+ exhausted T-cells pre-treatment is a putative biomarker for successful PD-1-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Venous thromboembolism is common in individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases, but the pathogenic basis for this increased thrombotic risk remains poorly understood. Myeloid cell ‘trained immunity’ describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a novel maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages trained previously with either β-glucan or free haem exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant and antifibrinolytic gene expression and activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. The β-glucan training-mediated increase in activated myeloid cell procoagulant activity was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase-mediated tissue factor (TF) functional decryption. Furthermore, pre-treatment with methyltransferase and acetyltransferase inhibitors to erase epigenetic marks associated with innate immune memory diminished trained macrophage TF gene expression in β-glucan-trained macrophages. Functional analysis of splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan-trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Remarkably, monocyte procoagulant activity increased proportionately with time since β-glucan administration, before plateauing at 4 weeks. Furthermore, haematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid isolated from β-glucan-trained mice possessed enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in immunothrombotic disease development, opening new avenues for targeted intervention.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immunotherapies targeting T cells in solid cancers are revolutionizing clinical treatment. Novel immunotherapies have had extremely limited benefit for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we characterized the immune microenvironment of t(8;21) AML patients to determine how immune cell infiltration status influenced prognosis. Methods Through multi-omics studies of primary and longitudinal t(8;21) AML samples, we characterized the heterogeneous immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and their immune checkpoint gene expression. Further external cohorts were also included in this research. Results CD8+ T cells were enriched and HAVCR2 and TIGIT were upregulated in the CD34+CD117dim%-High group; these features are known to be associated with immune exhaustion. Data integration analysis of single-cell dynamics revealed that a subset of T cells (cluster_2) (highly expressing GZMB, NKG7, PRF1 and GNLY) evolved and expanded markedly in the drug-resistant stage after relapse. External cohort analysis confirmed that the cluster_2 T-cell signature could be utilized to stratify patients by overall survival outcome. Discussion In conclusion, we discovered a distinct T-cell signature by scRNA-seq that was correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Our research provides a novel system for classifying patients based on their immune microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Due to the historical dogma, that host defense against intracellular pathogens is mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response. Here we addressed the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10) secreting B cells in long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Our research highlights the previously unknown role of B cell-derived IL-10 as a negative regulator of protective immunity in TB. For the first time, we demonstrate that mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 show increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, as evidenced by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was accompanied by male-specific immune alterations, indicating a previously unknown sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key effectors in co-ordinating inflammatory and immune responses to threats to the host. How macrophages decipher diverse danger signals to tailor inflammatory responses remains an unanswered question. Cell volume control is critical for normal cellular function. Disturbances in extracellular and intracellular homeostasis induce changes in cell volume, but the impact of disruptions in cell volume in controlling macrophage inflammatory responses is poorly understood. Here, we discover that macrophages use cell volume control as a bona fide danger sensing mechanism to promote and augment inflammatory responses. Using macrophages deficient in the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), which lack cell volume control under hypo-osmotic conditions, we show that disruptions in cell volume are sensed by macrophages to drive a large transcriptomic response and induction of inflammation. Cell volume disruption, particularly loss of cell volume control, induces type I interferon signalling through a DNA– and STING-dependent mechanism, but independent of cGAS and 2’3’cGAMP transport. Further, we found that cell volume changes synergise with diverse pathogen-mediated signalling to augment type I interferon responses and exacerbate the cytokine storm in a mouse model of hyperinflammation. Our findings highlight cell volume as an important regulator in shaping inflammatory responses, adding to our understanding of how macrophages sense complex danger signals and threats.">

        <tr id="Objective: The immune response initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is poorly elucidated. We aimed to access and compare the antiviral cellular responses and lymphocytes activation between healthy pregnancies and pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We detected the immunological changes of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of healthy non-pregnant women, non-pregnant women with COVID-19, healthy pregnant women, pregnant women with COVID-19 and convalescent group by flow cytometry. In vitro blockade was used to identify NKT-like cell activation through ICOS-ICOSL pathway. Results: We found that CD3+CD56+ NKT-like cells decreased significantly in COVID-19 positive pregnant women compared to healthy pregnant women. NKT-like cells of pregnant women expressed higher level of activating receptors CD69 and NKp46 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly, they also increased the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule ICOS. NKT-like cells of pregnant women with COVID-19 up-regulated the expression of IFN-γ, CD107a and Ki67. Meanwhile, we found that ICOSL expression was significantly increased on pDCs in pregnant women with COVID-19. Blocking ICOS in vitro significantly decreased the antiviral activity of NKT-like cells in COVID-19 positive pregnant women, suggesting that ICOS-ICOSL may play an important role in the virus clearance by NKT-like cells. Conclusions: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, NKT-like cells of pregnant women activated through ICOS-ICOSL pathway and played an important role in the antiviral response.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance. Here we report that p16High immune cells play a key role in establishing disease tolerance. We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan. Our data highlight the beneficial role of p16High immune subsets in establishing a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells and involves an interplay between β cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in β cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and PD-1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets from inhibitor-treated mice revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways. RNA sequencing of polarized proinflammatory macrophages showed that VLX-1005 significantly reduced the interferon response. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal (SEP) neurons, engineered to conditionally proliferate at 330C, differentiate when arrested at 37.50C and can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine independent cDNA libraries were made to follow arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses in normal (Nl) uninfected and CJ agent infected SEP cells. Proliferating Nl versus latently infected (CJ-) cells showed few RNA-seq differences. However arrest induced major changes. Normal cells displayed a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts. Additionally, known neuron differentiation transcripts, e.g., Agtr2, Neuregulin-1, GDF6, SFRP4 and Prnp were upregulated. These Nl neurons also displayed many activated IFN innate immune genes, e.g., OAS1, RTP4, ISG20, GTB4, CD80 and cytokines, complement, and clusterin (CLU) that binds to misfolded proteins. In contrast, arrested highly infectious CJ+ cells (10 logs/gm) downregulated many replication controls. Furthermore, arrested CJ+ cells suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ agent infection. CJ+ cells also enhanced IFN stimulated pathways, and analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection can enhance and expand anti-viral responses; 3) latent CJ infection epigenetically imprints many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. CJ+ brain microglia, white blood cells and intestinal myeloid cells with shared transcripts may be stimulated to educe latent CJD infections that can be clinically silent for >30 years.">

        <tr id="Stem-like progenitors are a critical subset of cytotoxic T cells that self-renew and give rise to expanded populations of effector cells critical for successful checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor-draining lymph nodes can support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish the tumor sites and act as a critical source of expanded effector populations, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Using advanced 3D multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here we identified antigen-presentation niches in tumor-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance, and affinity evolution of a unique population of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6hi stem-like CD8+ T cells. Our results show that contrary to the prevailing view that persistent TCR signaling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement well beyond the initial priming phase sustained the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway plays a central role in this process by mediating the fine-tuning of TCR and co-stimulatory signal input that enables selective expansion of high affinity TCR stem-like clones, enabling them to act as a renewable source of high affinity effector cells. PD-1 checkpoint blockade disrupts this fine tuning of input signaling, leading to terminal differentiation to the effector state or death of the most avid anti-tumor stem-like cells. Our results thus reveal an unexpected relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative feedback regulatory loop, and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumor effect that comes at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high affinity stem-like precursors.">

        <tr id="IL-32 expression is important for pathogen clearance but detrimental in chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer. T cells are major IL-32 producers in these diseases and key mediators of pathogen and tumor elimination but also autoimmune destruction. However, their contribution to IL-32 biology during immune responses is hardly understood due to several isoforms with divergent inflammatory properties. Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells often become dysfunctional during tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unclear. To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

        <tr id="The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTregs5–7, understanding of their characteristics remains incomplete, and the APC subset responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RORγt-APCs are similarly required for differentiation of food antigen-specific pTregs and establishment of oral tolerance. The ability of these cells to direct both food and microbiota-specific pTreg cell differentiation is contingent on expression of RORγt and on a unique cis-regulatory element within the Rorc gene locus (Rorc(t) +7kb). Absent this +7kb element, there was a notable increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTregs, leading to compromised tolerance in a mouse asthma model. By employing single-cell analyses across these models, as well as freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, we identified a rare subset of evolutionarily conserved APCs that are dependent on RORγt, uniquely express the Prdm16 transcription factor, and are endowed with essential mediators for inducing pTreg cell differentiation. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how RORγt-APCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Hodgkin and Reed – Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) actively modify the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) attracting immunosuppressive cells and expressing inhibitory molecules. A high frequency of myeloid cells in the TME is correlated with an unfavorable prognosis, but more specific and rare cell populations lack precise markers. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been identified in the peripheral blood of cHL patients, where they appear to be correlated with disease aggressiveness. TNFRSF9 (CD137) is a T cell co-stimulator expressed by monocytic and dendritic cells. Its expression has also been described in HRS cells, where it is thought to play a role in reducing antitumor responses. Here, we perform qualitative and quantitative analyses of lymphocytic and MDSC subtypes and determine the CD137 cell distribution in cHL primary tumors using multiplex immunofluorescence and automated multispectral imaging. The results were correlated with patients’ clinical features. Cells were stained with specific panels of immune checkpoint markers (PD-1, PD-L1, CD137), tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD3, PD-1), and monocytic cells/MDSCs (CD68, CD14, CD33, Arg-1, CD11b). This approach allowed us to identify distinct phenotypes and to analyze spatial interactions between immune subpopulations and tumor cells. The results confirm CD137 expression by T, monocytic and HRS cells. In addition, the expression of CD137, T exhausted cells, and monocytic MDSCs (m-MDSCs) in the vicinity of malignant HRS cells were associated with a worse prognosis. Our findings reveal new elements of the TME that mediate immune escape, and confirm CD137 as a candidate target for immunotherapy in cHL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell engagers (TCEs) are becoming an integral class of biological therapeutic owing to their highly potent ability to eradicate cancer cells. Nevertheless, the widespread utility of classical CD3-targeted TCEs has been limited by narrow therapeutic index (TI) linked to systemic CD4+ T cell activation and aberrant cytokine release. One attractive approach to circumvent the systemic activation of pan CD3+ T cells and reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome is to redirect specific subsets of T cells. A promising strategy is the use of peptide-major histocompatibility class I bispecific antibodies (pMHC-IgGs), which have emerged as an intriguing modality of TCE, based on their ability to selectively redirect highly reactive viral-specific effector memory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to eliminate cancer cells. However, the relatively low frequency of these effector memory cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may hamper their redirection as effector cells for clinical applications. To mitigate this potential limitation, we report here the generation of a pMHC-IgG derivative known as guided-pMHC-staging (GPS) carrying a covalent fusion of a monovalent interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutein (H16A, F42A). Using an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) arm as a proof-of-concept, tumor-associated antigen paired with a single-chain HLA-A *02:01/CMVpp65 pMHC fusion moiety, we demonstrate in vitro that the IL-2-armored GPS modality robustly expands CMVpp65-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells and induces potent cytotoxic activity against target cancer cells. Similar to GPS, IL-2-armored GPS molecules induce modulated T cell activation and reduced cytokine release profile compared to an analogous CD3-targeted TCE. In vivo we show that IL-2-armored GPS, but not the corresponding GPS, effectively expands grafted CMVpp65 CD8+ T cells from unstimulated human PBMCs in an NSG mouse model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the IL-2-armored GPS modality exhibits a favorable developability profile and monoclonal antibody-like pharmacokinetic properties in human neonatal Fc receptor transgenic mice. Overall, IL-2-armored GPS represents an attractive approach for treating cancer with the potential for inducing vaccine-like antiviral T cell expansion, immune cell redirection as a TCE, and significantly widened TI due to reduced cytokine release.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath, leading to irreversible and progressive functional deficits in patients. Pre-clinical studies involving the use of neural stem cells (NSCs) have already demonstrated their potential in neuronal regeneration and remyelination. However, the exclusive application of cell therapy has not proved sufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic levels. Recognizing these limitations, there is a need to combine cell therapy with other adjuvant protocols. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) can contribute to intercellular communication, stimulating the production of proteins and lipids associated with remyelination and providing trophic support to axons. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of NSCs and EVs derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. OPCs were differentiated from NSCs and had their identity confirmed by gene expression analysis and immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized by Western, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Experimental therapy of C57BL/6 mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were grouped in control, treated with NSCs, treated with OPC-derived EVs and treated with a combination of both. The treatments were evaluated clinically using scores and body weight, microscopically using immunohistochemistry and immunological profile by flow cytometry. The animals showed significant clinical improvement and weight gain with the treatments. However, only the treatments involving EVs led to immune modulation, changing the profile from Th1 to Th2 lymphocytes. Fifteen days after treatment revealed a reduction in reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the groups treated with EVs. However, there was no reduction in demyelination. The results indicate the potential therapeutic use of OPC-derived EVs to attenuate inflammation and promote recovery in EAE, especially when combined with cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity plays a crucial role in defending against coronaviruses, particularly at respiratory sites, serving as the first line of defense against viral invasion and replication. Coronaviruses have developed various immune evasion strategies at the mucosal immune system, hindering the recognition of infected cells and evading antibody responses. Understanding the immune mechanisms and responses is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses. The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 is significant, influencing both local and systemic immune responses to the virus. Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Mucosally delivered vaccines and those under clinical trials are being compared and contrasted to understand their effectiveness in inducing mucosal immunity against coronaviruses. A greater understanding of lung tissue-based immunity may lead to improved diagnostic and prognostic procedures and novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing the disease burden of community-acquired pneumonia, avoiding the systemic manifestations of infection and excess morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review article outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. It also proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes. The findings from recent studies on mucosal immunity in COVID-19 can be used to develop effective vaccines and treatments that can effectively target both mucosal and systemic immune responses.">

Interferons(IFNs) have been identified as cornerstones of epithelial cell-intrinsic defense against such pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA transcripts (>200 nt) not translated into protein and represent a critical regulatory component of mucosal defense. We report here that lncRNA Nostrill facilitates IFN-γ-stimulated intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic defense against infection by Cryptosporidium, an important opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients and a common cause of diarrhea in young children. Nostrill promotes transcription of a panel of genes controlled by IFN-γ through facilitating Stat1 chromatin recruitment and thus, enhances expression of several genes associated with cell-intrinsic defense in intestinal epithelial cells in response to IFN-γ stimulation, including Igtp, iNos, and Gadd45g. Induction of Nostrill enhances IFN-γ-stimulated intestinal epithelial defense against Cryptosporidium infection, which is associated with an enhanced autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings reveal that Nostrill enhances the transcription of a set of genes regulated by IFN-γ in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, induction of Nostrill facilitates the IFN-γ-mediated epithelial cell-intrinsic defense against cryptosporidial infections.">

We hypothesized that macrophages/monocytes responses to influenza would diverge between young and older mice despite our evidence that macrophages from both groups appear to control viral replication at similar rates. While inflammatory monocyte infiltration contributed to influenza induced morbidity/lung inflammation in adults, they did not appear to contribute to morbidity in young mice. Instead, young mice appeared to develop lung inflammation through a lack of interferon gamma (IFNψ) and infection of macrophage populations. In contrast, adult mice controlled early viral replication through macrophage populations (alveolar, interstitial, and inflammatory) and inflammatory monocytes. While intrinsic limitations in anti-viral cytokine responses, especially IFNψ, characterized the macrophage response to viral infection in young mice, the innate immune response to infection appears diminished compared to adults. This study highlights the intrinsic limitations in macrophage effector functions that may arise in young children but that also contribute to disease pathology.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant aggravating factor in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.">

        <tr id="Alterations in the lung microbiome frequently accompany adverse pulmonary outcomes. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) markedly affects the lung microbiome corresponding with a high incidence of post-HCT pulmonary complications. In a preclinical mouse model of HCT, we observed a reduction in Lactobacillus johnsonii within the lung microbiome following transplantation. Intranasal administration of live or heat-killed (HK) L. johnsonii at low doses reduced gammaherpesvirus-induced pulmonary fibrosis in HCT mice, in which IL-17A plays an essential role. HK L. johnsonii treatment of HCT mice suppressed inflammatory cytokine production by lung macrophages and decreased Il17a expression in T helper 17 (Th17) cells. HK L. johnsonii increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of type II conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in HCT mice and in vitro in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). HK L. johnsonii-exposed BMDCs also inhibited IL-17A secretion from co-cultured Th17 cells in a PD-1-dependent manner. Notably, when HK L. johnsonii was administered to HCT mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells from PD-1 knockout (KO) mice, which lack a PD-L1 mediated response, HK L. johnsonii-mediated reduction of pulmonary fibrosis was negated. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that HK L. johnsonii mitigates herpesvirus-induced pulmonary fibrosis in HCT mice by modulating cDC2 surface expression of PD-L1, which subsequently suppresses Il17a expression in Th17 cells, pointing towards a potential postbiotic-based strategy for immunomodulation to address pulmonary complications of HCT.">

        <tr id="Background Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are pivotal in B cell responses. Activation of the purinergic receptor P2X7 on Tfh cells regulates their activity. We investigated the ATP-P2X7R axis in circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells during Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Methods We analyzed two cohorts: children with RSV infection (moderate, n=30; severe, n=21) and healthy children (n=23). We utilized ELISA to quantify the levels of PreF RSV protein-specific IgG antibodies, IL-21 cytokine, and soluble P2X7R (sP2X7R) in both plasma and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Additionally, luminometry was employed to determine ATP levels in plasma, NPA and supernatant culture. The frequency of cTfh cells, P2X7R expression, and plasmablasts were assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate apoptosis, proliferation, and IL-21 production by cTfh cells, we cultured PBMCs in the presence of Bz-ATP and/or P2X7R antagonist (KN-62) and a flow cytometry analysis was performed. Results In children with severe RSV disease, we observed diminished titers of neutralizing anti-PreF IgG antibodies. Additionally, severe infections, compared to moderate cases, were associated with fewer cTfh cells and reduced plasma levels of IL-21. Our investigation revealed dysregulation in the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection. This was characterized by elevated ATP levels in both plasma and NPA samples, increased expression of P2X7R on cTfh cells, lower levels of sP2X7R, and heightened ATP release from PBMCs upon stimulation, particularly evident in severe cases. Importantly, ATP exposure decreased cTfh proliferative response and IL-21 production, while promoting their apoptosis. The P2X7R antagonist KN-62 mitigated these effects. Furthermore, disease severity positively correlated with ATP levels in plasma and NPA samples and inversely correlated with cTfh frequency. Conclusion Our findings indicate that activation of the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection may contribute to limiting the cTfh cell compartment by promoting cell death and dysfunction, ultimately leading to increased disease severity.">

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway. From a clinical perspective, this study also sheds light on potential clinical benefits observed in patients on prophylactic AZM regimens against various respiratory diseases and opens avenues for future adjunct therapy against Th1- and Tc1-dominated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of disease severity and tissue damage extent. Improving myelin restoration is essential to prevent neurodegeneration and the associated disability in MS patients. However, remyelinating therapies are failing in clinical trials, in part, due to the absence of classifying biomarkers of different endogenous regenerative capacities amongst enrolled patients. We previously reported that circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) at the onset of the murine model of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are associated with milder disease courses and less degree of demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cord lesions, while at peak are indicative of a better symptom recovery. Moreover, M-MDSCs are able to promote in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation towards mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) through the release of the soluble factor osteopontin. Results Here, we show a relationship between disease severity and a gradient of OPCs between the rim and the core in mixed active-inactive lesions of MS patients, along with a positive correlation between M-MDSC density and OPC abundance in the same lesions. We also show that EAE disease severity negatively influences the density of total and newly generated OPCs found associated to the demyelinated lesions of the spinal cord at the peak of the disease. In addition, disease severity also impacts the abundance of newly generated OLs originated either during the effector phase or during the early recovery phase. We also demonstrate the positive association between infiltrated M-MDSCs and the abundance of OPCs in the periplaque of demyelinating lesions at the peak of EAE. Interestingly, circulating M-MDSCs at EAE onset and peak of the disease are directly associated to a higher density of newly generated OLs in the plaque and periplaque, respectively. Conclusion Disease severity clearly impacts oligodendrocyte generation during a neuroinflammatory insult like EAE. Our results set the basis for further studies on M-MDSCs as a promising new biomarker that identify a CNS prone to the generation of new OLs that may contribute to restore myelin.">

        <tr id="Liver fibrosis associated with increased mortality is caused by activation of hepatic stellate cells and excessive production and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to fibrotic insults. It has been shown that in addition to liver inflammation, systemic inflammation also contributes to liver fibrogenesis. A deeper understanding of mechanisms that control liver fibrotic response to intra- and extra-hepatic inflammation is essential to develop novel clinical strategies against this disease. Extracellular vesicles (EV) have been recognized as immune mediators that facilitate activation of hepatic stellate cells. In inflammatory diseases, activated neutrophils release neutrophil elastase (NE) bound to EV, which has been identified as a significant contributor to inflammation by promoting immune cell activation. Here, we aimed to explore the role of inflammation derived plasma EV-associated NE in liver fibrogenesis and its potential mechanisms. We show EV-associated NE induces activation, proliferation and migration of hepatic stellate cells by promoting activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This effect did not occur through EV without surface NE, and Sivelestat, a NE inhibitor, inhibited activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway mediated by EV-associated NE. Moreover, we found plasma EV-associated NE increases deposition of collagen1 and α-smooth muscle actin in the liver of a mouse model of liver fibrosis (Mdr2-/-). Notably, this effect does not occur in control mice without preexisting liver disease. These data suggest that EV-associated NE is a pro-fibrogenic factor for hepatic stellate cell activation via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in pre-existing liver injuries. Inhibition of the plasma EV-associated NE in inflammatory conditions may be a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis in patients with inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Effector T lymphocytes are avid glucose consumers, but can function in the nutrient-poor environments of tumors. However, availability of blood-delivered nutrients throughout the tumor is not homogeneous, and how this affects effector T cells is not well known. Here we have isolated tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) from mouse solid tumors by their capacity to capture blood-transported probes, and compared them with glucose-restricted T cells. Glucose restriction in vitro arrested cell proliferation but reduced only moderately the induction of hallmark glucose-dependent cytokines interferon gamma (IFNγ) and IL-17. In vivo, effector TILs with reduced access to blood had characteristics of glucose-restricted cells, such as reduced expression of IFNγ and genes associated with cell proliferation. However, they expressed more CXCR3, which identifies effective antitumor T lymphocytes, showed an enhanced IFN response signature, and had reduced expression of surface PD-1. We also identified genes regulated by the enzyme ACSS2, which allows TILs to sustain gene expression in glucose-poor environments. Thus, effector T lymphocytes infiltrating tumors express different gene signatures in regions with different accessibility to blood, and can maintain specific glucose-dependent responses even in poorly perfused tumor regions.

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway causes autoimmunity in humans and mice; however, the exact mechanism by which the cGAS-STING pathway initiates adaptive immunity and tissue pathology is still not fully understood. Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

Here, we observed accelerated progression of Zika virus (ZIKV)-induced disease in mice with depleted skin bacteria by topical antibiotic treatment prior to ZIKV infection. Increased viral loads in the blood, draining lymph node, spleen and brain of antibiotic-treated mice suggested faster ZIKV dissemination. Flow cytometry revealed increased frequencies of T cells in the lymph nodes, along with enhanced activation of T cells in the brain upon antibiotic treatment.

        <tr id="Persistent lung inflammation is a hallmark of Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Inflammation can lead to functional decline in hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs), tipping the balance towards myelopoiesis and contributing to chronic inflammation. However, it’s unknown whether the HSCs are dysfunctional in CF. We tested whether chronic lung inflammation impacts hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in a CF mouse model. Wild-type (WT) and Cftr-/- mice were nebulized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for 5 weeks. The mice were euthanized before the exposure (T0), 24 hours after the last LPS nebulization (T1), or 6 weeks (T2) after the last LPS nebulization. The bone marrow (BM) and lung tissue were collected for flow cytometry analysis of the HSPC population and immune cells in the lungs, respectively. Peripheral blood was collected for complete blood count analysis. At baseline, Cftr-/- mice show a larger HSPC population with a myeloid bias, indicated by higher frequencies of LSK, LT-HSC, CD41+ LT-HSC, GMPs, and MkPs. Following chronic LPS nebulization, Cftr-/- mice exhibit greater HSPC expansion and myeloid differentiation, alongside increased peripheral myeloid cell counts. Post-recovery, while most HSPC populations return to baseline, Cftr-/- mice retain elevated myeloid-biased LT-HSCs, suggesting a persistent myeloid bias. These findings underscore a prominent shift toward myeloid hematopoiesis in CF, which is accentuated by chronic inflammation and remains even after recovery. Further experiments are underway to assess maladaptive epigenetic changes in HSC as well as if chronic lung inflammation impacts HSC functionality.">

        <tr id="Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted via aerosols. To understand how MeV exits the airways of an infected host, we use unpassaged primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE). MeV typically remains cell-associated in HAE and forms foci of infection, termed infectious centers, by directly spreading cell-to-cell. We previously described the phenomenon in which infectious centers detach en masse from HAE and remain viable. Here we investigate the mechanism of this cellular detachment. Via immunostaining, we observed loss of tight junction and cell adhesion proteins within infectious centers. These morphological changes indicate activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can contribute to wound healing in respiratory epithelia by mobilizing nearby cells. Inhibiting TGF-β, and thus EMT, reduced infectious center detachment. Compared to uninfected cells, MeV-infected cells also expressed increased levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a regulator of live cell extrusion. Live cell extrusion encourages cells to detach from respiratory epithelia by contracting the actomyosin of neighboring cells. Inhibition or induction of live cell extrusion impacted infectious center detachment rates. Thus, these two related pathways contributed to infectious center detachment in HAE. Detached infectious centers contained high titers of virus that may be protected from the environment, allowing the virus to live on surfaces longer and infect more hosts. This mechanism may contribute to the highly contagious nature of MeV. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen that continues to cause large, disruptive outbreaks each year. Here, we examine a phenomenon that may help explain the contagious nature of MeV: detachment of MeV-infected cells. MeV spreads cell-to-cell in human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to form groups of infected cells, termed “infectious centers”. We reported that infectious centers ultimately detach from HAE as a unit, carrying high titers of virus. Viral particles within cells may be more protected from environmental conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. We identified two host pathways, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and live cell extrusion, that contribute to infectious center detachment. Perturbing these pathways altered the kinetics of infectious centers detachment. These pathways influence one another and contribute to epithelial wound healing, suggesting infectious center detachment may be a usurped consequence of the host’s response to infection that benefits MeV by increasing its transmissibility between hosts.">

        <tr id="Introduction Exosomes produced by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (LeishEXO) are well-established drivers of virulence, though mechanisms underlying their exacerbation of experimental leishmaniasis remain elusive. Expression of Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a protein implicated in exosome-mediated pathologies and viral internalization, has been shown to correlate with cutaneous leishmaniasis severity. Given ANXA1’s regulation of myeloid cells – the canonical hosts for Leishmania – we studied the potential role of ANXA1 and its receptors FPR1/2 in exerting LeishEXO’s effects. Methods Murine and in vitro ANXA1-/- models were used to study the generation of protective TH1 responses during experimental L. major infection with and without LeishEXO. Recruitment of inflammatory cells was assessed using a peritoneal cell recruitment assay and immunophenotyping, and production of inflammatory mediators was measured using a cytokine and chemokine array. Treatment of experimental models with FPR2 antagonist WRW4 and FPR1/2 agonist WKYMVm was used to delineate the role of the FPR/ANXA1 axis in LeishEXO-mediated hyperpathogenesis. Results We established that ANXA1 deficiency prohibits LeishEXO-mediated pathogenesis and myeloid cell infection, with minimal alterations to adaptive and innate immune phenotypes. FPR2 blockade with WRW4 similarly inhibited leishmanial hyperpathogenesis, while direct activation of FPRs with WKYMVm enhanced infection and recapitulated the LeishEXO-mediated phenotype. This research describes LeishEXO’s utilization of the ANXA1/FPR axis to facilitate parasitic internalization and pathogenesis, which may be leveraged in the development of therapeutics for leishmaniasis.">

        <tr id="Trm cells are sequestered at barrier tissues as a swift first line defense against peripheral reinfections in both antigen dependent and antigen independent bystander modes. Trm cells are also capable of mediating autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, wherein autoreactive Trm cells are aberrantly activated. To quickly combat infections, activated Trm cells can stimulate the influx and activation of memory T cells and innate immune cells. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the inflammatory responses that Trm cell populations can induce, specifically in the activation of the innate profile. Most studies to date have utilized a reductionist approach to examine single Trm populations, specific pathogens, and defined tissues. Herein, we adopted a more holistic approach utilizing barrier-free ‘dirty’ mice to profile activated innate cells attracted to the skin in the presence of quiescent cutaneous Trm cells. Notably, dirty mice are a more human predictive model due to having a diverse microbial experience that leads to the development of a complete complement of Trm cells in the skin. We demonstrate that in the dirty mouse model mice have a significant reduction in cutaneous neutrophils and monocytes compared to SPF mice following local treatment with two separate innate stimuli. These findings reveal that cutaneous Trm cells have the capacity to temper the innate immune response and further substantiate the implication that Trm cells are heterogenous in their functions depending in large part on their tissue residency. However, in an autoimmune microenvironment Trm cells are capable of recruiting innate cells to the site of an exposure to a damage-associated molecular pattern. Likely due to the imbalance of IL-17 and IFN-γ.">

        <tr id="Most patients treated with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells eventually experience disease progression. Furthermore, CAR T cells have not been curative against solid cancers and several hematological malignancies such as T cell lymphomas, which have very poor prognoses. One of the main barriers to the clinical success of adoptive T cell immunotherapies is CAR T cell dysfunction and lack of expansion and/or persistence after infusion. In this study, we found that CD5 inhibits CAR T cell activation and that knockout (KO) of CD5 using CRISPR-Cas9 enhances the antitumor effect of CAR T cells in multiple hematological and solid cancer models. Mechanistically, CD5 KO drives increased T cell effector function with enhanced cytotoxicity, in vivo expansion, and persistence, without apparent toxicity in preclinical models. These findings indicate that CD5 is a critical inhibitor of T cell function and a potential clinical target for enhancing T cell therapies. Deleting CD5 with CRISPR-Cas9 enhances T cell activation and proliferation, boosting their antitumor effects in multiple tumor models. Editor’s summary The currently available chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have had limited efficacy for a wide range of solid cancers and hematological malignancies, due in part to CAR T cell dysfunction. The scavenger receptor CD5 associates with the T cell receptor (TCR) and inhibits T cell function. Patel et al. show that genetic deletion of CD5 in CAR and TCR T cells enhances expansion, persistence, and cytotoxicity and is effective in preclinical solid tumor and hematological malignancy models. These results suggest that CD5 may be a critical negative regulator of CAR T cells that can be therapeutically targeted. —Christiana Fogg">

While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts. Altogether, our data reveal significant differences in how seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses antagonize the human IFN response at the single cell level.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immune checkpoint (IC) blockade and adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T-cells (ACT) are two major strategies to treat metastatic melanoma. Their combination can potentiate T-cell activation in the suppressive tumor microenvironment, but the autoimmune adverse effects associated with systemic injection of IC blockers persist with this strategy. ACT of tumor-reactive T-cells defective for IC expression would overcome this issue. For this purpose, PD-1 and TIGIT appear to be relevant candidates, because their co-expression on highly tumor-reactive lymphocytes limits their therapeutic efficacy within the tumor microenvironme,nt. Our study compares the consequences of PDCD1 or TIGIT genetic deletion on anti-tumor properties and T-cell fitness of melanoma-specific T lymphocytes. Transcriptomic analyses revealed down-regulation of cell cycle-related genes in PD-1KO T-cells, consistent with biological observations, whereas proliferative pathways were preserved in TIGITKO T-cells. Functional analyses showed that PD-1KO and TIGITKO T-cells displayed superior antitumor reactivity than their wild-type counterpart in vitro and in a preclinical melanoma model using immunodeficient mice. Interestingly, it appears that TIGITKO T-cells were more effective at inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vivo, and persist longer within tumors than PD-1KO T-cells, consistent with the absence of impact of TIGIT deletion on T-cell fitness. Taken together, these results suggest that TIGIT deletion, over PD-1 deletion, in melanoma-specific T-cells is a compelling option for future immunotherapeutic strategies.">

Gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the context of HIV/Mtb coinfection have been understudied in children, despite in vitro evidence suggesting γδ T cells assist with Mtb control. We investigated whether boosting a specific subset of γδ T cells, phosphoantigen-reactive Vγ9+Vδ2+ cells, could improve TB outcome using a nonhuman primate model of pediatric HIV/Mtb coinfection. Juvenile Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), equivalent to 4–8-year-old children, were infected intravenously (i.v.) with SIV. After 6 months, MCM were coinfected with a low dose of Mtb and then randomized to receive zoledronate (ZOL), a drug that increases phosphoantigen levels, (n=5; i.v.) at 3- and 17-days after Mtb accompanied by recombinant human IL-2 (s.c.) for 5 days following each ZOL injection. A similarly coinfected MCM group (n=5) was injected with saline as a control. Vγ9+Vδ2+ γδ T cell frequencies spiked in the blood, but not airways, of ZOL+IL-2-treated MCM following the first dose, however, were refractory to the second dose. At necropsy eight weeks after Mtb, ZOL+IL-2 treatment did not reduce pathology or bacterial burden. γδ T cell subset frequencies in granulomas did not differ between treatment groups. These data show that transiently boosting peripheral γδ T cells with ZOL+IL-2 soon after Mtb coinfection of SIV-infected MCM did not improve Mtb host defense.">

        <tr id="Hypomethylating agents are used as frontline therapy for myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), but clinical response is unpredictable. To determine whether response was associated with in vivo dynamics of DNA hypomethylation, we conducted a phase 2 trial for MDS using both injection and oral azacitidine (AZA). We established that global DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were comparable in AZA responders and non-responders during their course of treatment. However, there were distinct baseline and early drug induced differences in CpG methylation in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in responders compared to non-responders that overlapped with regulatory regions of genes associated with tissue patterning, cell migration and myeloid differentiation. Following six cycles of therapy when clinical response typically manifests, differential hypomethylation in responder HSPCs pointed to marrow adaptation as a driver of enhanced haematopoiesis. Taken together, CpG methylation differences in HSPCs may explain variable response to AZA.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction syndrome caused by dysregulated host response to infection, characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. The use of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and organ support therapy has limited prognostic benefit in patients with sepsis, and its incidence is not diminishing, which is attracting increased attention in medicine. Sepsis remains one of the most debilitating and expensive illnesses. One of the main reasons of septic mortality is now understood to be disruption of immune homeostasis. Immunotherapy is revolutionizing the treatment of illnesses in which dysregulated immune responses play a significant role. This “trained immunity”, which is a potent defense against infection regardless of the type of bacteria, fungus, or virus, is attributed to the discovery that the innate immune cells possess immune memory via metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. Here we reviewed the immunotherapy of innate immune cells in sepsis, the features of trained immunity, and the relationship between trained immunity and sepsis.">

Further phenotypical analysis confirmed the granulocytic-like features of this monocyte subpopulation that is associated with an increase in granulocyte–monocyte precursors (GMPs) in the PB of these patients (pts). Mechanistically, this granulocyte-like monocyte population suppressed NK cell activity by inducing TIGIT and engaging NKp30. Accordingly, an increased frequency of TIGIT+ NK cells with impaired functions was found in both the PB and tumoral tissue of CRC pts. Collectively, we provided new mechanistic explanations for tumor immune escape occurring in CRC by showing the increase in this new kind of MDSC, in both PB and CRC tissue, which is able to significantly impair the effector functions of NK cells, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis (LN) is an autoimmune disease that rapidly progresses as a secondary consequence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has a very poor prognosis. Therefore, this study aimed to identify characteristics of immune cell infiltration and investigate potential therapeutic targets using bioinformatics methods and the Murphy Roths Large/lymphoproliferation (MRL/lpr) mouse model. In this study, a total of 2,810 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which were primarily enriched in inflammatory and immune regulation pathways. From these DEGs, 226 immune-related genes (IRGs) were also identified. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) revealed that patients with LN had increased infiltration of effector memory CD4+ T cells, effector memory CD8+ T cells, gamma delta T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), follicular helper T cells, Th1 cells, and Th2 cells, and this was closely correlated with the DEG-IRGs. Furthermore, the potential therapeutic biomarkers, CD244, S100 calcium binding protein P (S100P), and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC), were identified by Random Forest Approach (RFA), which were validated in LN mice. These findings provide new evidence and insights for further research on diagnosis and treatment of LN by identifying critical genes and their associations with immune infiltration.">

L-phenylalanine also restrains memory CD4+T proliferation in an IL4I1-dependent manner and inhibits Th2 cell proliferation and differentiation. RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, flow cytometry and proteomics, validated in vitro and across patients’ cohorts, revealed an impairment in LAT1-dependent transport of L-phenylalanine into Th2 cells in allergy with an increase in its intracellular processing, accompanied by an expansion of pathogenic Th2 cells. Thus, our study identifies L-phenylalanine as a checkpoint in the development, energy metabolism and function of Th2 cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract The poor prognosis observed in elderly individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) remains a serious clinical burden and the underlying mechanism is unclear, which necessities detailed investigation of disease characteristics and research for efficient countermeasures. To simulate lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in senescent human patients, 80‐week‐old male hamsters are intranasally inoculated with different doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 variant. Exposure to a low dose of the Omicron BA.5 variant results in early activation of the innate immune response, followed by rapid viral clearance and minimal lung damage. However, a high dose of BA.5 results in impaired interferon signaling, cytokine storm, uncontrolled viral replication, and severe lung injury. To decrease viral load and reverse the deterioration of COVID‐19, a new bio‐mimic decoy called CoVR‐MV is used as a preventive or therapeutic agent. Administration of CoVR‐MV as a preventive or therapeutic intervention in the early stages of infection can effectively suppress viral load, regulate the immune response, and rescue animals from death and critical illness. These findings underscore the risk associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 exposure in senescent hamsters and highlight the importance of early intervention to prevent disease progression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of stem cells originating in the bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that AML survival and relapse are controlled by genetic alterations, as well as a functional interaction between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the biology of immune evasion in AML and explore the current landscape of immune-based therapies. We argue that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment in AML could help predict responses to immunotherapy and guide decisions for future treatment. Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematopoietic clonal disorder with limited curative options beyond stem cell transplantation. The success of transplant is intimately linked with the graft versus leukemia effect from the alloreactive donor immune cells including, T and NK cells. The immune system plays a dynamic role in leukemia survival and resistance. Despite our growing understanding of the immune microenvironment, responses to immune-based therapies differ greatly between patients. Herein, we review the biology of immune evasion mechanisms in AML, discuss the current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, and discuss the implications of therapeutic targets. This review focuses on T and NK cell-based therapy, including modified and non-modified NK cells, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, antibodies, and checkpoint blockades. Understanding the complex interchange between immune tolerance and the emergence of tumor resistance will improve patient outcomes.">

Building on previous work, we hypothesized that shifting epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell state would restore HCMV biosynthesis and progeny production. To test this hypothesis, we induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using TGF-β and the EMT-transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL. We found that shifting strongly epithelial cell lines to a mesenchymal cell state shifted HCMV infection from a semi-permissive to fully permissive state. This effect appeared to involve two distinct mechanisms: EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral entry and EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral mRNA translation. Although the precise mechanisms remain elusive, our findings identify the epithelial-mesenchymal cell state axis as an important regulator of HCMV infection and provide new insights into how cellular differentiation states influence viral replication. They also raise the possibility that the EMT pathway, a fundamental pathway involved in development and cancer metastasis, could regulate HCMV infection in-vivo, potentially contributing to viral persistence or pathogenesis in epithelial tissues.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Attenuated measles virus (MV) exerts its oncolytic activity in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells that lack type-I interferon (IFN-I) production or responsiveness. However, other cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as myeloid cells, possess functional antiviral pathways. In this study, we aimed to characterize the interplay between MV and the myeloid cells in human MPM. We cocultured MPM cell lines with monocytes or macrophages and infected them with MV. We analyzed the transcriptome of each cell type and studied their secretion and phenotypes by high-dimensional flow cytometry. We also measured transgene expression using an MV encoding GFP (MV-GFP). We show that MPM cells drive the differentiation of monocytes into M2-like macrophages. These macrophages inhibit GFP expression in tumor cells harboring a defect in IFN-I production and a functional signaling downstream of the IFN-I receptor, while having minimal effects on GFP expression in tumor cells with defect of responsiveness to IFN-I. Interestingly, inhibition of the IFN-I signaling by ruxolitinib restores GFP expression in tumor cells. Upon MV infection, cocultured macrophages express antiviral pro-inflammatory genes and induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes in tumor cells. MV also increases the expression of HLA and costimulatory molecules on macrophages and their phagocytic activity. Finally, MV induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-I, and PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and macrophages. These results show that macrophages reduce viral proteins expression in some MPM cell lines through their IFN-I production and generate a pro-inflammatory interplay that may stimulate the patient’s anti-tumor immune response.">

        <tr id="Cell plasticity (CP), describing a dynamic cell state, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis during organ morphogenesis, regeneration and damage-to-repair biological process. Single-cell-omics datasets provide unprecedented resource to empowers analysis on CP. Hematopoiesis offers fertile opportunities to develop quantitative methods for understanding CP with rich supports from experimental ground-truths. In this study we generated high-quality lineage-negative (Lin−) single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets under various conditions and introduced a working pipeline named Snapdragon to interrogate naïve and disturbed plasticity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with mutational or environmental challenges. Utilizing embedding methods UMAP or FA, a continuum of hematopoietic development is visually observed in wildtype where the pipeline confirms a very low Proportion of hybrid-cells (Phc, with bias range: 0.4-0.6) on a transition trajectory. Upon Tet2 mutation, a driver of leukemia, or treatment of DSS, an inducer of colitis, Phc is increased and plasticity of HSPCs was enhanced. Quantitative analysis indicates that Tet2 mutation enhances HSC self-renewal capability while DSS treatment results in an enhanced myeloid-skewing trajectory, suggesting their similar but different consequences. We prioritized several transcription factors (i.e the EGR family) and signaling pathways (i.e. receptors IL1R1 and ADRB, inflammation and sympathy-sensing respectively) which are responsible for Phc alterations. CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation. In conclusion, the study provides high-quality datasets with single-cell transcriptomic matrices for diversified hematopoietic simulations and a computational pipeline Snapdragon for quantifying disturbed Phc and CP. (247 words) Highlights To guide CP analysis, we introduce a quantizable parameter Phc and a pipeline Snapdragon, which discriminate naive and disturbed hematopoiesis; The Snapdragon pipeline analysis on Tet2+/-Lin− cells demonstrates many novel insights, including enhanced HSC plasticity and increased PHC; similar trends are observed in inflammatory Lin− cells; Regulon analysis suggests that transcriptional factor EGR1 is significantly activated to elevated the HSC plasticity and change hematopoietic trajectory; Stress-response-related signaling pathways mediated by receptors IL1R1 or ADRB were obviously activated in the challenged hematopoiesis; CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells are a major immune cell subset in pigs. Approximately 50% of circulating T cells are γδ T cells in young pigs and up to 30% in adult sows. Despite this abundance, the functions of porcine γδ T cells are mostly unidentified. In humans and mice, activated γδ T cells exhibit broad innate cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of stressed, infected, and cancerous cells through death receptor/ligand-dependent and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. However, so far, it is unknown whether porcine γδ T cells have the ability to perform cytotoxic functions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of porcine γδ T cells isolated from blood, lung, and nasal mucosa. To further analyze the cytolytic potential of γδ T cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using purified γδ T cells as effector cells and virus-exposed or mock-treated primary porcine alveolar macrophages as target cells. Results Our results show that only CD2+ γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers (CD16, NKp46, perforin) with higher perforin and NKp46 expression in γδ T cells isolated from lung and nasal mucosa. Moreover, we found that γδ T cells can exhibit cytotoxic functions in a cell-cell contact and degranulation-dependent manner. However, porcine γδ T cells did not seem to specifically target Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or swine Influenza A Virus-infected macrophages, which may be due to viral escape mechanisms. Conclusion Porcine γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers and can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro. The specific mechanisms by which porcine γδ T cells recognize target cells are not fully understood but may involve the detection of cellular stress signals.">

        <tr id="Stem-like CD8+ T cells (TSL) are a subset of immune cells with superior persistence and antitumor immunity. They are TCF1+ PD-1+ and important for the expansion of tumor specific CD8+ T cells in response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. In acute infections, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector and memory CD8+ T cells; in cancer and chronic infections, persistent antigen stimulation can lead to T cell exhaustion. Recent studies have highlighted the dichotomy between late dysfunctional (or exhausted) T cells (TLD) that are TCF1– PD-1+ and self-renewing TCF1+ PD-1+ TSL from which they derive. TCF1+ TSL cells are considered to have stem cell-like properties akin to memory T cell populations and can give rise to cytotoxic effector and transitory T cell phenotypes (TTE) which mediate tumor control. In this review, we will discuss recent advances made in research on the formation and expansion of TSL, as well as distinct niches required for their differentiation and maintenance in the setting of cancer. We will also discuss potential strategies to generate these cells, with clinical implications for stemness enhancement in vaccine design, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and adoptive T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process that gets skewed toward myelopoiesis. This restrains lymphopoiesis, but the role of lymphocytes in this process is not well defined. To unravel the intricacies of neutrophil responses in COVID-19, we performed bulk RNAseq on neutrophils from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients. Principal component analysis revealed distinguishing neutrophil gene expression alterations in COVID-19 patients. ICU and ward patients displayed substantial transcriptional changes, with ICU patients exhibiting a more pronounced response. Intriguingly, neutrophils from COVID-19 patients, notably ICU patients, exhibited an enrichment of immunoglobulin (Ig) and B cell lineage-associated genes, suggesting potential lineage plasticity. We validated our RNAseq findings in a larger cohort. Moreover, by reanalyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data on human bone marrow (BM) granulocytes, we identified the cluster of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP) enriched with Ig and B cell lineage-associated genes. These cells with lineage plasticity may serve as a resource depending on the host’s needs during severe systemic infection. This distinct B cell subset may play a pivotal role in promoting myelopoiesis in response to infection. The scRNAseq analysis of BM neutrophils in infected mice further supported our observations in humans. Finally, our studies using an animal model of acute infection implicate IL-7/GM-CSF in influencing neutrophil and B cell dynamics. Elevated GM-CSF and reduced IL-7 receptor expression in COVID-19 patients imply altered hematopoiesis favoring myeloid cells over B cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the relationship between the B-neutrophil lineages during severe infection, hinting at potential implications for disease pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE This study investigates the dynamics of hematopoiesis in COVID-19, focusing on neutrophil responses. Through RNA sequencing of neutrophils from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients, distinct gene expression alterations are identified, particularly in ICU patients. Notably, neutrophils from COVID-19 patients, especially in the ICU, exhibit enrichment of immunoglobulin and B cell lineage-associated genes, suggesting potential lineage plasticity. Validation in a larger patient cohort and single-cell analysis of bone marrow granulocytes support the presence of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors with B cell lineage-associated genes. The findings propose a link between B-neutrophil lineages during severe infection, implicating a potential role for these cells in altered hematopoiesis favoring myeloid cells over B cells. Elevated GM-CSF and reduced IL-7 receptor expression in stress hematopoiesis suggest cytokine involvement in these dynamics, providing novel insights into disease pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="CD36 expression in both immune and non-immune cells is known to be directly involved in cancer metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by malignant melanocytes play a vital role in developing tumor-promoting microenvironments, but it is unclear whether this is mediated through CD36. To understand the role of CD36 in melanoma, we first analyzed the SKCM dataset for clinical prognosis, evaluated the percentage of CD36 in lymphatic fluid-derived EVs (LEVs), and tested whether melanoma-derived EVs increase CD36 expression and induce M2-macrophage-like characteristics. Furthermore, we performed a multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging analysis to evaluate the CD36 expression and its colocalization with various other cells in the lymph node (LN) of patients and control subjects. Our findings show that cutaneous melanoma patients have a worse clinical prognosis with high CD36 levels, and a higher percentage of CD36 in total LEVs were found at baseline in melanoma patients compared to control. We also found that monocytic and endothelial cells treated with melanoma EVs expressed more CD36 than untreated cells. Furthermore, melanoma-derived EVs can regulate immunosuppressive macrophage-like characteristics by upregulating CD36. The spatial imaging data show that cells in tumor-involved sentinel LNs exhibit a higher probability of CD36 expression than cells from control LNs, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusively, our findings demonstrated that CD36 plays a vital role in controlling the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the LN, which can promote the formation of a protumorigenic niche.">

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying treatment response for targeted therapeutics in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is challenging due to the limited understanding of diverse responses of circulating immune cells, particularly B cells. We investigated B lymphocyte dynamics during anti-BAFF treatment, utilizing longitudinal single-cell transcriptome data.


METHODS
We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on PBMCs in four Korean SLE patients before and after belimumab treatment at the following time points: 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.


RESULTS
Analyzing over 73 000 PBMCs, we identified 8 distinct subsets of B cells and plasmablasts and analyzed dynamic changes within these cell subsets: initial declines in naive and transitional B cells followed by an increase at three months, contrasted by an initial increase and subsequent decrease in memory B cells by the third month. Meanwhile, plasmablasts exhibited a consistent decline throughout treatment. B cell activation pathways, specifically in naive and memory B cells, were downregulated during the third and sixth months. These findings were validated at the protein level throughout the first four weeks of treatment using flow cytometry. Comparative analysis with bulk transcriptome data from 22 Japanese SLE patients showed increased NR4A1 expression six months post-belimumab treatment, indicating its role in restricting self-reactive B cells, thereby contributing to the biological responses of anti-BAFF treatment.


CONCLUSION
The observed B cell dynamics provided insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of anti-BAFF in SLE patients. Furthermore, it underscores the need for research in predicting drug responses based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells play a key role in inflammation as a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it remains unclear how innate immunity-mediated inflammation is fine-tuned to minimize tissue damage and assure the host’s survival at the early phase of systemic inflammation. The results of this study with mouse models demonstrate that the supply of monocytes is restricted depending on the magnitude of inflammation. During the acute phase of severe inflammation, monocytes, but not neutrophils, were substantially reduced by apoptosis and the remaining monocytes were dysfunctional in the bone marrow. Monocyte-specific ablation of Casp3/7 prevented monocyte apoptosis but promoted monocyte necrosis in the bone marrow, leading to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the increased mortality of mice during systemic inflammation. Importantly, the limitation of monocyte supply was dependent on pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Consistently, a reduction of monocytes was observed in the peripheral blood during cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) patients, a pathogen-unrelated systemic inflammation induced by chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy. Thus, monocytes act as a safety valve to alleviate tissue damage caused by inflammation and ensure host survival, which may be responsible for a primitive immune-control mechanism that does not require intervention by acquired immunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

How Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the influence of HIV-1 on pathogenesis remains unclear. Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone; and combined in an in vitro BBB we investigated Mtb +/− HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Mtb infected and multiplied in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. The permeability of the BBB increased resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects included increased markers of cellular stress, ROS release, the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes, and increased secretion of neuroexcitotoxic glutamate. Distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators were observed. These data indicate Mtb can translocate the BBB directly to initiate meningitis.">

Substantial evidence has shown a relationship between immune phenotype lymphocytes and COVID-19 disease severity and/or implication in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, belonging to ABO blood groups has been investigated as a correlation factor to COVID-19 disease. This pilot study investigated lymphocyte typing in a cohort of blood donors to understand the underlying mechanism in SARS-CoV-2 infection linked to the blood group. The study cohort consisted of 20–64-year-old subjects, without comorbidities, from both sexes, who were COVID-19 vaccinated with previous or no infection history. Whole blood samples, collected at A.O.R.N. Sant’Anna and San Sebastiano Hospital (Campania Region), were processed by multiparametric cytofluorimetric assay, to characterize CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell CD3+ subpopulations. The CD45RA, CCR7, CD27, CD28, CD57 and PD-1 markers were investigated to delineate the peripheral T-cell maturation stages. Differences were detected in ABO blood types in CD3+, CD4+ gated on CD3+, CD8+ and CD8+ gated on CD3+ percentage. These results contribute to identifying a memory cell “identikit” profile in COVID-19 disease, thus leading to a useful tool in precision medicine.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mount an immune response upon exposure to antigens and pathogens. Emerging evidence shows that macrophages exposed to an antigen can generate a “memory-like” response (a.k.a. trained immunity), which confers a non-specific and enhanced response upon subsequent stimulation with a second antigen/microbe. This trained immunity has been implicated in the enhanced response of macrophages against several invading pathogens. However, the association between the nature of the antigen and the corresponding immune correlate of elicited trained immunity is not fully understood. Similarly, the response of macrophages trained and restimulated with homologous stimulants to subsequent infection by pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains unexplored. Here, we report the immune and metabolic profiles of trained immunity in human THP-1-derived macrophages after homologous training and restimulation with BCG, LPS, purified protein Derivative (PPD), heat-killed Mtb strains HN878 (hk-HN), and CDC1551 (hk-CDC). Furthermore, the impact of training on the autophagic and antimicrobial responses of macrophages with or without subsequent infection by clinical Mtb isolates HN878 and CDC1551 was evaluated. Results show that repeated stimulation of macrophages with different antigens displays distinct pro-inflammatory, metabolic, antimicrobial, and autophagy induction profiles. These macrophages also induce a differential antimicrobial response upon infection with clinical Mtb HN878 and CDC1551 isolates. A significantly reduced intracellular bacterial load was noted in the stimulated macrophages, which was augmented by the addition of rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. These observations suggest that the nature of the antigen and the mode of stimulation shape the magnitude and breadth of macrophage innate memory response, which impacts subsequent response to Mtb infection. IMPORTANCE Trained immunity (a.k.a. innate memory response) is a novel concept that has been rapidly emerging as a mechanism underpinning the non-specific immunity of innate immune cells, such as macrophages. However, the association between the nature of the stimuli and the corresponding immune correlate of trained immunity is not fully understood. Similarly, the kinetics of immunological and metabolic characteristics of macrophages upon “training” by the same antigen as primary and secondary stimuli (homologous stimulation) are not fully characterized. Furthermore, the ability of antigens such as purified protein derivative (PPD) and heat-killed-Mtb to induce trained immunity remains unknown. Similarly, the response of macrophages primed and trained by homologous stimulants to subsequent infection by pathogenic Mtb is yet to be reported. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that the nature of the stimuli impacts the depth and breadth of trained immunity in macrophages, which differentially affects their response to Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are an integral part of the innate immune system, but their biology is not well understood in the context of cancer. Distinctive resident macrophage populations are identified in different organs in mice using fate mapping studies. They develop from the yolk sac and self-maintain themselves lifelong in specific tissular niches. Similarly, breast-resident macrophages are part of the mammary gland microenvironment. They reside in the breast adipose tissue stroma and close to the ductal epithelium and help in morphogenesis. In breast cancer, TRMs may promote disease progression and metastasis; however, precise mechanisms have not been elucidated. TRMs interact intimately with recruited macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and other immune cells along with cancer cells, deciding further immunosuppressive or cytotoxic pathways. Moreover, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is generally associated with poor outcomes, can harbor specific TRM phenotypes. The influence of TRMs on adipose tissue stroma of the mammary gland also contributes to tumor progression. The complex crosstalk between TRMs with T cells, stroma, and breast cancer cells can establish a cascade of downstream events, understanding which can offer new insight for drug discovery and upcoming treatment choices. This review aims to acknowledge the previous research done in this regard while exploring existing research gaps and the future therapeutic potential of TRMs as a combination or single agent in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant public health concern. Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the severity of COVID-19, since the respiratory, thrombotic and myocardial complications of the disease are closely linked to vascular endothelial damage. To address this issue, we evaluate here the effect of conditioned media from spike S1-activated macrophages (CM_S1) on the proliferation of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the specific role of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Results obtained demonstrate that the incubation with CM_S1 for 72 h hinders endothelial cell proliferation and induces signs of cytotoxicity. Comparable results are obtained upon exposure to IFN-γ + TNF-α, which are thus postulated to play a pivotal role in the effects observed. These events are associated with an increase in p21 protein and a decrease in Rb phosphorylation, as well as with the activation of IRF-1 and NF-kB transcription factors. Overall, these findings further sustain the pivotal role of a hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines as a trigger for endothelial activation and injury in the immune-mediated effects of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the considerable progress in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment, relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is still frequent and associated with a poor prognosis. Relapse has been shown to be correlated with an incomplete eradication of CD34+ leukemic stem cells prior to HSCT. Previously, we have shown that a novel CD34-directed, bispecific T-cell engager (BTE) can efficiently redirect the T-cell effector function toward cancer cells, thus eliminating leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. However, its impact on γδ T-cells is still unclear. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the CD34-specific BTE using in vitro expanded γδ T-cells as effectors. We showed that the BTEs bind to γδ T-cells and CD34+ leukemic cell lines and induce target cell killing in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, γδ T-cell mediated killing was found to be superior to αβ T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we observed that only in the presence of BTE the γδ T-cells induced primary AML blast killing in vitro. Importantly, our results show that γδ T-cells did not target the healthy CD34intermediate endothelial blood–brain barrier cell line (hCMEC/D3) nor lysed CD34+ HSCs from healthy bone marrow samples.">

        <tr id="Objective: To investigate the expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in circulating exosomes, and to define the role of exosomal PD-L1 in promoting immune escape mechanism during chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) and related liver diseases. Methods: The levels of PD-L1 expressed in exosomes were detected by ELISA. CD8+T cells were sorted and cytotoxicity test was assessed by flow cytometry. PD-L1 protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Circulating exosomal PD-L1 levels were significantly higher in patients with CHB and HCC than in healthy controls (F =7.46, P=0.001). Levels of CD107a on CD8+T cells in patients with CHB receiving PD-L1 blocking antibody were significantly lower than in patients receiving isotype blocking antibody (t = 4.96, P < 0.01). Levels of TNF-α in cell culture supernatants of the PD-L1 blocking antibody group were significantly higher than in the isotype blocking antibody group (t =5.92, P < 0.01). Compared with patients receiving isotype blocking antibody, levels of CD107a on CD8+T cells significantly increased in patients with HCC receiving anti-PD-L1 antibody (t = 3.51, P<0.05). Compared with adjacent tissues, the levels of PD-L1 protein expression in HCC tissues were slightly higher; however, no significant difference between the two groups was observed. Conclusions: PD-L1 blockade in exosomes might promote the cytotoxic function of CD8+T cells and inhibit immune evasion during progression of HCC. Blocking PD-L1 in exosomes reduced the cytotoxic function of CD8+T cells in patients with CHB while enhancing the production of proinflammatory cytokines.">

        <tr id="Influenza infections result in a significant number of severe illnesses annually, many of which are complicated by secondary bacterial super-infection. Primary influenza infection has been shown to increase susceptibility to secondary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection by altering the host immune response, leading to significant immunopathology. Type III interferons (IFNs), or IFNλs, have gained traction as potential antiviral therapeutics due to their restriction of viral replication without damaging inflammation. The role of IFNλ in regulating epithelial biology in super-infection has recently been established; however, the impact of IFNλ on immune cells is less defined. In this study, we infected wild-type and IFNLR1-/- mice with influenza A/PR/8/34 followed by S. aureus USA300. We demonstrated that global IFNLR1-/- mice have enhanced bacterial clearance through increased uptake by phagocytes, which was shown to be cell-intrinsic specifically in myeloid cells in mixed bone marrow chimeras. We also showed that depletion of IFNLR1 on CX3CR1 expressing myeloid immune cells, but not neutrophils, was sufficient to significantly reduce bacterial burden compared to mice with intact IFNLR1. These findings provide insight into how IFNλ in an influenza-infected lung impedes bacterial clearance during super-infection and show a direct cell intrinsic role for IFNλ signaling on myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFN on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a proinflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBM displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAM. These findings uncover type I IFN–inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM. Significance: Our study shows that re-education of tumor-associated macrophages by tumoral IFNβ translates into improved clinical outcome in patients with melanoma brain metastases, providing pathomechanistic insights into synergistic type I interferon–inducing therapies with immunotherapies and warranting investigation of IFNβ as a predictive biomarker for combined radioimmunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Human alveolar type I (AT1) cells are specialized epithelial cells that line the alveoli in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. The primary function of AT1 cells is not only to facilitate efficient gas exchange between the air and the blood in the lungs, but also to contribute to the structural integrity of the alveoli to maintain lung function and homeostasis. Aging has notable effects on the structure, function, and regenerative capacity of human AT1 cells. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these age-related changes in AT1 cells remains limited. Leveraging a recent single-cell transcriptomics dataset we generated on healthy human lungs, we identified a series of significant molecular alterations in AT1 cells from aged lungs. Notably, the aged AT1 cells exhibited increased cellular senescence and chemokine gene expression, alongside diminished epithelial features such as decreases in cell junctions, endocytosis, and pulmonary matrisome gene expression. Gene set analyses also indicated that aged AT1 cells were resistant to apoptosis, a crucial mechanism for turnover and renewal of AT1 cells, thereby ensuring alveolar integrity and function. Further research on these alterations is imperative to fully elucidate the impact on AT1 cells and is indispensable for developing effective therapies to preserve lung function and promote healthy aging.">

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) targets the central nervous system (CNS), leading to potentially severe neurological complications. The neurovascular unit plays a fundamental role in the CNS and in the neuroinvasion of TBEV. However, the role of human brain pericytes, a key component of the neurovascular unit, during TBEV infection has not yet been elucidated. In this study, TBEV infection of the primary human brain perivascular pericytes was investigated with highly virulent Hypr strain and mildly virulent Neudoerfl strain. We used Luminex assay to measure cytokines/chemokines and growth factors. Both viral strains showed comparable replication kinetics, peaking at 3 days post infection (dpi). Intracellular viral RNA copies peaked at 6 dpi for Hypr and 3 dpi for Neudoerfl cultures. According to immunofluorescence staining, only small proportion of pericytes were infected (3% for Hypr and 2% for Neudoerfl), and no cytopathic effect was observed in the infected cells. In cell culture supernatants, IL-6 production was detected at 3 dpi, together with slight increases in IL-15 and IL-4, but IP-10, RANTES and MCP-1 were the main chemokines released after TBEV infection. These chemokines play key roles in both immune defense and immunopathology during TBE. This study suggests that pericytes are an important source of these signaling molecules during TBEV infection in the brain.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most healthy individuals recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas a remarkable number continues to suffer from unexplained symptoms, known as Long COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). It is therefore imperative that methods for preventing and treating the onset of PASC be investigated with the utmost urgency. Methods A mathematical model of the immune response to vaccination and viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, incorporating immune memory cells, was developed. Results and discussion Similar to our previous model, persistent infection was observed by the residual virus in the host, implying the possibility of chronic inflammation and delayed recovery from tissue injury. Pre-infectious vaccination and antiviral medication administered during onset can reduce the acute viral load; however, they show no beneficial effects in preventing persistent infection. Therefore, the impact of these treatments on the PASC, which has been clinically observed, is mainly attributed to their role in preventing severe tissue damage caused by acute viral infections. For PASC patients with persistent infection, vaccination was observed to cause an immediate rapid increase in viral load, followed by a temporary decrease over approximately one year. The former was effectively suppressed by the coadministration of antiviral medications, indicating that this combination is a promising treatment for PASC.">

        <tr id="To efficiently absorb nutrients and facilitate microbial commensalism, the host establishes tolerogenic immune programs against dietary and commensal antigens, promoted by peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs)1,2. Previous research into which antigen-presenting cells (APCs) initiate dietary pTreg responses focused on type 1 DCs (cDC1)3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt+ APCs4–8, and not by cDC1. Instead, pTregs interact with cDC1 to regulate the response of food-specific CD8αβ T cells that accumulate in the lamina propria (LP) and epithelial layer of the small intestine (SI) and express memory markers. Upon infection with pathogens that mimic dietary antigens, food-specific CD8αβ cells activate an effector program to potentially guard against ‘Trojan horse’ attacks. Uniquely, after the infection resolves, these cells do not respond to their corresponding dietary antigens, allowing for safe food consumption. Based on our findings, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, dedicated antigen-presenting cells direct a unique CD8αβ response that is coupled to the pTreg program to facilitate protective acute effector responses within the overall strategy of tolerance.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in infants presents distinctive challenges due to their developing immune systems and unique viral-host interactions compared to adults. This review examines current knowledge on viral-host interactions and immune responses in HIV-infected infants, focusing on immune development, viral dynamics, and therapeutic implications. The immune system of infants undergoes rapid maturation during early life, influencing their susceptibility to HIV infection and responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Key aspects include thymic function, cytokine profiles, and the establishment of immune memory, which collectively shape immune responses against HIV. Viral dynamics in HIV-infected infants differ markedly from those in adults, characterized by high viral loads, diverse viral subtypes, and the early establishment of viral reservoirs within immune cells. These reservoirs, particularly in sanctuary sites like the central nervous system, pose challenges for achieving viral eradication and long-term remission. Effective management requires strategies to characterize and target these reservoirs, alongside early intervention to mitigate viral replication and preserve immune function. Advances in viral monitoring technologies and treatment regimens are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing the global burden of pediatric HIV infection.

        <tr id="Cardiovascular events seem to occur more frequently after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests a possible role of immune checkpoints in accelerating atherosclerosis formation. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of soluble and membrane-bound immune checkpoints in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We assessed the levels of 14 soluble immune checkpoints in fasting blood plasma of PAD patients (intermittent claudication, n= 37) and healthy controls (HCs, n=39) by Multiplex protein assay. We measured the levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1/2), B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), glucocorticoid-induced TNRF-related protein (GITR), herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), CD28, CD27, CD80, CD137 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). The surface expression of CD28, PD-L2, PD-1, GITR, LAG-3, TIM-3 and BTLA on peripheral blood immune cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine production capacity was measured by flow cytometry in TIM-3+ T cells to determine immune exhaustion. Soluble levels of PD-L2 were decreased in PAD patients, but only in females, whereas soluble levels of TIM-3 showed a trend towards increased concentration in female PAD patients. All monocyte subsets had increased frequencies of PD-L2+ cells in PAD patients. CD4+ T cells had increased frequencies of TIM-3+ cells, which showed little overlap with other immune exhaustion markers. TIM-3+ CD4+ T cells appeared to have a low capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, but a higher capacity to produce IL-10 compared to TIM-3-CD4+ T cells. We found that PAD patients show differences in expression of both membrane-bound and soluble immune checkpoints. Some of these differences might be caused by prolonged immune activation, although immune exhaustion markers did not always overlap.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a rare, yet potentially fatal disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) enterotoxins, known as superantigens, which trigger an intense immune response. Our previous study demonstrated the protective effect of tofacitinib against murine toxin-induced shock and a beneficial effect against S. aureus sepsis. In the current study, we examined the effects of tofacitinib on T-cell response in peripheral blood using a mouse model of enterotoxin-induced shock. Our data revealed that tofacitinib suppresses the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. Furthermore, both gene and protein levels of Th1 cytokines were downregulated by tofacitinib treatment in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. Importantly, we demonstrated that CD4+ cells, but not CD8+ cells, are pathogenic in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. In conclusion, our findings suggest that tofacitinib treatment suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation and Th1 response, thereby aiding in protection against staphylococcal toxic shock in mice. This insight may guide the future development of novel therapies for STSS.">

        <tr id="Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) represents endogenous mechanisms of negative immunoregulation. While the modulation of effector functions has been the major focus of PD-1 research, quick PD-1 upregulation in naïve T cells starting 1 h after priming raised a possibility that PD-1 also affects the development of effector T cells. The role of PD-1 in functional differentiation into Th1 and Th2 has been unclear. In murine naïve CD4+ T cell activation, we found that PD-1 stimulation during the early stage of T cell activation strongly impaired Th2 cell development, while Th1 cell induction was relatively resistant to this immunosuppressive signaling. The steep decline in Th2 cell induction suggested the significance of PD-1 in allergic inflammation. Treatment with anti-human PD-1 agonist antibody inhibited allergic inflammation in human PD-1-knock-in mice as shown by the reduction of Th2 cells, IgE levels and eosinophilic infiltration. This study shows that PD-1 regulates not only the intensity but also the quality of immune response by deviating Th differentiation. PD-1 stimulators are projected to be valuable in suppressing various forms of inflammatory activities, but the efficacy against Th2-dominant immune response may be particularly high.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis and AIDS remain two of the most relevant human infectious diseases. The pathogens that cause them, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV, individually elicit an immune response that treads the line between beneficial and detrimental to the host. Co-infection further complexifies this response since the different cytokines acting on one infection might facilitate the dissemination of the other. In these responses, the role of type I interferons is often associated with antiviral mechanisms, while for bacteria such as Mtb, their importance and clinical relevance as a suitable target for manipulation are more controversial. In this article, we review the recent knowledge on how these interferons play distinct roles and sometimes have opposite consequences depending on the stage of the pathogenesis. We highlight the dichotomy between the acute and chronic infections displayed by both infections and how type I interferons contribute to an initial control of each infection individually, while their chronic induction, particularly during HIV infection, might facilitate Mtb primo-infection and progression to disease. We expect that further findings and their systematization will allow the definition of windows of opportunity for interferon manipulation according to the stage of infection, contributing to pathogen clearance and control of immunopathology.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

        <tr id="AbstractThroughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophages is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation of CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 predisposes to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). While monocytes/macrophages play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of atherosclerosis, less is known about their immunopathogenic mechanisms that lead to CVDs during COVID-19. Natural killer (NK) cells, which play an intermediary role during pathologies like atherosclerosis, are dysregulated during COVID-19. Here, we sought to investigate altered immune cells and their associations with CVD risk during severe COVID-19.


METHODS
We measured plasma biomarkers of CVDs and determined phenotypes of circulating immune subsets using spectral flow cytometry. We compared these between patients with severe COVID-19 (severe, n=31), those who recovered from severe COVID-19 (recovered, n=29), and SARS-CoV-2-uninfected controls (controls, n=17). In vivo observations were supported using in vitro assays to highlight possible mechanistic links between dysregulated immune subsets and biomarkers during and after COVID-19. We performed multidimensional analyses of published single-cell transcriptome data of monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19 to substantiate in vivo findings.


RESULTS
During severe COVID-19, we observed alterations in cardiometabolic biomarkers including oxidized-low-density lipoprotein, which showed decreased levels in severe and recovered groups. Severe patients exhibited dysregulated monocyte subsets, including increased frequencies of proinflammatory intermediate monocytes (also observed in the recovered) and decreased nonclassical monocytes. All identified NK-cell subsets in the severe COVID-19 group displayed increased expression of activation and tissue-resident markers, such as CD69. We observed significant correlations between altered immune subsets and plasma oxidized-low-density lipoprotein levels. In vitro assays revealed increased uptake of oxidized-low-density lipoprotein into monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of NK cells activated by plasma of patients with severe COVID-19. Transcriptome analyses confirmed enriched proinflammatory responses and lipid dysregulation associated with epigenetic modifications in monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides new insights into the involvement of monocytes and NK cells in the increased CVD risk observed during and after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Cystatin F (CstF) is a protease inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, including those involved in activating the perforin/granzyme cytotoxic pathways. It is targeted at the endolysosomal pathway but can also be secreted to the extracellular milieu or endocytosed by bystander cells. CstF was shown to be significantly increased in tuberculous pleurisy, and during HIV coinfection, pleural fluids display high viral loads. In human macrophages, our previous results revealed a strong upregulation of CstF in phagocytes activated by interferon γ or after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). CstF manipulation using RNA silencing led to increased proteolytic activity of lysosomal cathepsins, improving Mtb intracellular killing. In the present work, we investigate the impact of CstF depletion in macrophages during the coinfection of Mtb-infected phagocytes with lymphocytes infected with HIV. The results indicate that decreasing the CstF released by phagocytes increases the major pro-granzyme convertase cathepsin C of cytotoxic immune cells from peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. Consequently, an observed augmentation of the granzyme B cytolytic activity leads to a significant reduction in viral replication in HIV-infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Ultimately, this knowledge can be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches to control both pathogens based on manipulating CstF.">

        <tr id="Human astroviruses (HAstV) are major global causes of gastroenteritis, but little is known about host factors required for their cellular entry. Here, we utilized complementary CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout and activation screening approaches and identified neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP4) as entry factors for HAstV infection of human intestinal epithelial cells. Disruption of FcRn or DPP4 reduced HAstV infection in permissive cells and, reciprocally, overexpression of these factors in non-permissive cells was sufficient to promote infection. We observed direct binding between FcRn and HAstV virions as well as purified spike protein. Finally, inhibitors for DPP4 and FcRn currently in clinical use prevent HAstV infection in cell lines and primary human enteroids. Thus, our results reveal mechanisms of HAstV entry as well as druggable targets. One-Sentence Summary Targeting FcRn or DPP4 using available therapies effectively prevents human astrovirus infection in human enteroid cultures.">

        <tr id="Innate inflammation promotes tumor development, although the role of innate inflammatory cytokines in established human tumors is unclear. Here we report clinical and translational results from a phase Ib trial testing whether IL-1β blockade in human pancreatic cancer would alleviate myeloid immunosuppression and reveal antitumor T-cell responses to PD-1 blockade. Patients with treatment-naïve advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n=10) were treated with canakinumab, a high-affinity monoclonal human anti-interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the PD-1 blocking antibody spartalizumab, and gemcitabine/n(ab)paclitaxel. Analysis of paired peripheral blood from patients in the trial versus patients receiving multiagent chemotherapy showed a modest increase in HLA-DR+CD38+ activated CD8+ T cells and a decrease in circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by flow cytometry for patients in the trial, but not in controls. Similarly, we used patient serum to differentiate monocytic MDSCs in vitro and showed that functional inhibition of T-cell proliferation was reduced when using on-treatment serum samples from patients in the trial but not when using serum from patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Within the tumor we observed few changes in suppressive myeloid-cell populations or activated T cells as assessed by single-cell transcriptional profiling or multiplex immunofluorescence, although increases in CD8+ T cells suggest that improvements in the tumor immune microenvironment might be revealed by a larger study. Overall, the data indicate that exposure to PD-1 and IL-1β blockade induced a modest reactivation of peripheral CD8+ T cells and decreased circulating monocytic MDSCs; however, these changes did not lead to similarly uniform alterations in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Certain somatic mutations confer a fitness advantage in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) over normal HSPCs, resulting in the clonal expansion of mutant blood cells1, otherwise known as clonal haematopoiesis (CH). CH is frequently observed among healthy elderly people and is closely associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The most frequently mutated genes of CH include DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL12. Among them, even though ASXL1 mutations are clinically associated with the highest risk for developing CVDs, little is known whether and how the mutations contribute to CVDs. Here we show accelerated development of atherosclerosis and increased inflammatory monocytes in mice transplanted with the bone marrow cells (BMCs) from the mice expressing mutant ASXL1 (ASXL1-MT) selectively in hematopoietic cells. RNA sequencing analysis of the plaque-macrophages derived from BMCs expressing ASXL1-MT showed more inflammatory signatures than those from control BMCs. Mechanistically, wild-type ASXL1 inhibited innate immune signalling through direct interactions with IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1 in the cytoplasm, while ASXL1-MT, which only interacted with TAK1, lost this regulatory function, leading to NF-κB activation. This mechanism is unique and distinct from those of CH with Tet2 or Dnmt3a mutations, where overactivation of the IL-1β/NLRP3 inflammasome plays critical roles3–5. Intriguingly, IRAK1/4 inhibition decreased the number of inflammatory monocytes and attenuated the development of atherosclerosis driven by ASXL1-MT. The present work connects the mutations of an epigenetic factor, ASXL1, with inflammation and CVDs and gives an indication for the prevention of CVDs in CH.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. Methods In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell–cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. Results Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Our study reveals the dynamic cell–cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mucosal enrichment of the Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype and the expansion of pathogenic IFNγ-producing Th17 (pTh17) cells have been linked to Crohn’s Disease (CD) pathogenesis. However, the molecular pathways underlying the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell transdifferentiation in CD patients remain elusive. To this aim, we created and functionally screened a transposon AIEC mutant library of 10.058 mutants to identify the virulence determinants directly implicated in triggering IL-23 production and pTh17 cell generation. pTh17 cell transdifferentiation was assessed in functional assays by co-culturing AIEC-infected human dendritic cells (DCs) with autologous conventional Th17 (cTh17) cells isolated from blood of Healthy Donors (HD) or CD patients. AIEC triggered IL-23 hypersecretion and transdifferentiation of cTh17 into pTh17 cells selectively through the interaction with CD-derived DCs. Moreover, the chronic release of IL-23 by AIEC-colonized DCs required a continuous IL-23 neutralization to significantly reduce the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell differentiation. The multi-step screenings of the AIEC mutant’s library revealed that deletion of ybaT or rfaP efficiently hinder the IL-23 hypersecretion and hampered the AIEC-dependent skewing of protective cTh17 into pathogenic IFNγ-producing pTh17 cells. Overall, our findings indicate that ybaT (inner membrane transport protein) and rfaP (LPS-core heptose kinase) represent novel and attractive candidate targets to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation in CD.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The stress kinase MAPK13 (aka p38δ-MAPK) is an attractive entry point for therapeutic intervention because it regulates the structural remodeling that can develop after epithelial barrier injury in the lung and likely other tissue sites. However, a selective, safe, and effective MAPK13 inhibitor is not yet available for experimental or clinical application. Here we identify a first-in-kind MAPK13 inhibitor using structure-based drug design combined with a screening funnel for cell safety and molecular specificity. This inhibitor (designated NuP-4) down-regulates basal-epithelial stem cell reprogramming, structural remodeling, and pathophysiology equivalently to Mapk13 gene-knockout in mouse and mouse organoid models of post-viral lung disease. This therapeutic benefit persists after stopping treatment as a sign of disease modification and attenuates key aspects of inflammation and remodeling as an indication of disease reversal. Similarly, NuP-4 treatment can directly control cytokine-stimulated growth, immune activation, and mucinous differentiation in human basal-cell organoids. The data thereby provide a new tool and potential fix for long-term stem cell reprogramming after viral injury and related conditions that require MAPK13 induction-activation. New and noteworthy This study identifies a small-molecule inhibitor for MAPK13 with efficacy and safety in models of the long-term disease that features epithelial stem cell reprogramming towards inflammation and structural remodeling. The present model has direct implications for respiratory disease triggered by viral infection and other inhaled toxins, but the tissue distribution of MAPK13 implies related actions at other epithelial barrier sites. The findings also refine a hypothesis for therapeutic intervention based on proper adjustment of MAPK13 function with a selective kinase inhibitor.">

        <tr id="Cell therapies are at the forefront of novel therapeutics. Neutrophils, despite being the most populous immune cells in human blood circulation, are not considered a viable option for cellular therapies because of their short lifespan and poor understanding of their role in the pathophysiology of various diseases. In inflammatory conditions, neutrophils exhibit an activated phenotype. Activation brings about significant changes to neutrophil biology such as increased lifespan, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and enhanced effector functions. Activated neutrophils also possess the potential to stimulate the downstream immune response and are described as essential effectors in the immune response to tumors. This makes activated neutrophils an interesting candidate for cell therapies. Here, we review the biology of activated neutrophils in detail. We discuss the different ways neutrophils can be activated and the effect they have on other immune cells for stimulation of downstream immune response. We review the conditions where activated neutrophil therapy can be therapeutically beneficial and discuss the challenges associated with their eventual translation. Overall, this review summarizes the current state of understanding of neutrophil‐based immunotherapies and their clinical potential.">

        <tr id="The PD-1-PD-L1 immune checkpoint helps to maintain self-tolerance and prevent the development of autoimmune diseases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are successful immunotherapeutics for several cancers, but responding patients can develop immune-mediated adverse events. It is well established that PD-1 regulates CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, but its role in controlling the activation of pathogenic γδ T cells is less clear. Here we examined the role of PD-1 in regulating γδ T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We found that PD-1 was highly expressed on CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the lymph node (LN) and CNS of mice with EAE. Treatment of mice with anti-PD-1 significantly augmented IL-17A-producing CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the LN and CNS and enhanced the severity of EAE. The exacerbating effect of anti-PD-1 on EAE was lost in Tcrd-/- mice. Conversely, ligation of PD-1 suppressed Il17a and Rorc gene expression and IL-17A production by purified Vγ4 γδ T cells stimulated via the TCR, but not with IL-1β and IL-23. Our study demonstrates that PD-1 regulates TCR-activated CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells, but that cytokine-activated IL-17A producing γδ T cells escape the regulatory effects of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by the intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, an underreported and emerging global threat. As melioidosis-associated mortality is frequently high despite antibiotics, novel management strategies are critically needed. Therefore, we sought to determine whether functional changes in the host innate and adaptive immune responses are induced during acute melioidosis and are associated with outcome. Using a unique whole blood stimulation assay developed for use in resource-limited settings, we examined induced cellular functional and phenotypic changes in a cohort of patients with bacteremic melioidosis prospectively enrolled within 24 h of positive blood culture and followed for 28 days. Compared to healthy controls, melioidosis survivors generated an IL-17 response mediated by Th17 cells and terminally-differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells (P < .05, both), persisting to 28 days after enrolment. Furthermore, melioidosis survivors developed polyfunctional cytokine production in CD8+ T cells (P < .01). Conversely, a reduction in CCR6+ CD4+ T cells was associated with higher mortality, even after adjustments for severity of illness (P = 0.004). Acute melioidosis was also associated with a profound acute impairment in monocyte function as stimulated cytokine responses were reduced in classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Impaired monocyte cytokine function improved by 28-days after enrolment. These data suggest that IL-17 mediated cellular responses may be contributors to host defense during acute melioidosis, and that innate immune function may be impaired. These insights could provide novel targets for the development of therapies and vaccine targets in this frequently lethal disease.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which promotes a sustained inflammatory environment in the central nervous system. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the control of inflammation and might play a neuroprotective role. Indeed, a decrease in Treg number and function has been reported in PD. In this context, pramipexole, a dopaminergic receptor agonist used to treat PD symptoms, has been shown to increase peripheral levels of Treg cells and improve their suppressive function. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of pramipexole on immunoregulatory Treg cells and its possible neuroprotective effect on human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells. Methods Treg cells were sorted from white blood cells of healthy human donors. Assays were performed with CD3/CD28‐activated and non‐activated Treg cells treated with pramipexole at concentrations of 2 or 200 ng/mL. These regulatory cells were co‐cultured with in vitro‐differentiated human dopaminergic neurons in a cytotoxicity assay with 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐OHDA). The role of interleukin‐10 (IL‐10) was investigated by co‐culturing activated IL‐10‐producing Treg cells with neurons. To further investigate the effect of treatment on Tregs, gene expression in pramipexole‐treated, CD3/CD28‐activated Treg cells was determined by Fluidigm analysis. Results Pramipexole‐treated CD3/CD28‐activated Treg cells showed significant protective effects on dopaminergic neurons when challenged with 6‐OHDA. Pramipexole‐treated activated Treg cells showed neuroprotective capacity through mechanisms involving IL‐10 release and the activation of genes associated with regulation and neuroprotection. Conclusion Anti‐CD3/CD28‐activated Treg cells protect dopaminergic neurons against 6‐OHDA‐induced damage. In addition, activated, IL‐10‐producing, pramipexole‐treated Tregs also induced a neuroprotective effect, and the supernatants of these co‐cultures promoted axonal growth. Pramipexole‐treated, activated Tregs altered their gene expression in a concentration‐dependent manner, and enhanced TGFβ‐related dopamine receptor regulation and immune‐related pathways. These findings open new perspectives for the development of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of PD.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes are mediators of homeostasis but contribute to neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mounting evidence suggests involvement of peripheral immune cells in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential role of peripheral immune secreted cytokines in modulating midbrain astrocyte reactivity. Human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes were exposed to 5% and 10% CD4+ T cell conditioned media (CD4CM) for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days to assess chronic exposure. Additionally, astrocytes were exposed to the Th17 cell cytokine, IL-17A (10 ng/mL), alone and in combination with TNF-α (0.3 ng/mL) to assess potential synergistic effects of both cytokines at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. CD4CM induced acute and chronic alterations in midbrain astrocytes. Increased NFκB translocation to the nucleus, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, CXCL10 at 24 h, C3, LCN2, IL-6 at 24 and 48 h, as well as an increase in their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL10 at both these time points were observed. A synergistic response to the combination of IL-17A and TNF-α on increasing inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release occurred. IL-17A and TNF-α increased intensity of S100β at 24 h, decreased nuclear area and increased circularity of astrocytes at 72 h. A synergistic effect on γH2AX intensity at 72 h and an increase in LDH release at 7 days was observed. Our results demonstrate that IL-17A and TNF-α act synergistically, enhancing midbrain astrocyte reactivity to a similar degree as CD4CM. This highlights the importance of the peripheral immune secreted cytokines in increasing the reactivity status of midbrain astrocytes, implicating their role in PD.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare disease characterized by malignant cells derived from the epithelial cells of the biliary duct system. Despite extensive treatments, the prognosis for CCA remains poor, emphasizing the critical need for the development of novel treatments. Considerable attention has been directed towards innate immune effector cells, which can recognize tumor cells independently of the major histocompatibility complex, laying the foundation for the development of off-the-shelf drugs. In this study, we cultured innate immune cells obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy adults and conducted a comparative analysis of the effector functions against CCA cell lines by Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells. This analysis was performed using standard short- and long-term cytotoxicity assays, as well as ELISA for IFN-γ. Vδ2 γδ T cells demonstrated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in response to CCA cells in a TCR-dependent manner, particularly in the presence of tetrakis-pivaloyloxymethyl 2-(thiazole-2-ylamino)ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate, a bisphosphonate prodrug. In contrast, direct killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were relatively slow and weak. Conversely, NK cells displayed potent, direct cytotoxicity against CCA cells. In summary, both Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells show promise as innate immune effector cells for adoptive transfer therapy in the context of CCA.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and aberrant cytokine signaling. Methotrexate (MTX) is the preferred first-line treatment for RA, yet its precise mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. This study employed a multi-omics strategy—combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunophenotyping—to identify key effector peripheral immune cells and their cellular responses in RA patients over 12 weeks of MTX treatment. In our study, MTX was associated with significant immune modulation, including the restoration of naïve T and B cells and reductions in T cell memory subsets with these effects detectable as early as three weeks post-treatment. Plasmablast levels also emerged as a potential biomarker for early therapeutic response, reflecting MTX’s impact on immune homeostasis. Transcriptional analysis revealed modulation of key pathways, including TNF-α signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis. Network analysis identified critical regulatory hubs, such as EGR1, JAK2, and SOCS1, in monocytes and CD4 memory T cells, highlighting these cell types as key mediators of MTX’s effects. In conclusion, these findings advance our understanding of MTX’s effects on immune cell dynamics at different stages of treatment, showing for the first time the early cellular changes leading to immune modulation in RA. Altogether, our results provide the foundation for further mechanistic investigations into MTX.">

        <tr id="The immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play pivotal roles in modulating therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. While B cells have traditionally been viewed as bystanders in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests they may actively influence anti-tumor immunity, albeit with conflicting reports regarding their pro-tumor or anti-tumor roles. This study explores the crucial roles played by B cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping melanoma responses to ICB therapy. We show a significant enrichment of B cells in ICB therapy responders compared to non-responders, pre-treatment, through retrospective analyses of melanoma patient tumors. Functional assays demonstrate that B cell depletion impairs T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, underscoring the importance of B cells in anti-tumor responses. To investigate the clinical relevance, EVs were isolated from melanoma patient tumors, and fractioned into tumor and immune subpopulations. MiRNA profiling of CD19+ EVs identifies miR-99a-5p as a top candidate, among several others, upregulated in responders. Functional assays show that miR-99a-5p silencing in B cells diminishes T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity, suggesting its role in promoting B cell-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p influences B cell maturation within the TME by mediating class-switch recombination. Our findings highlight the important role of B cells and their derived EVs in shaping the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell-related pathways.

        <tr id="Self-antigens that are obscure to immune cells under homeostasis, are exposed following tissue damage and can trigger autoimmunity. Our previous work showed that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) mediate immunoregulation after traumatic skeletal muscle injury. Here, we found that, immune responses to injury in cDC1-depleted mice (Batf3-/-) mirror those of autoimmune mice (Aire-/-). Mechanistically, we determined that cDC1s prime killer regulatory T cells (CD8+/-Ly49+Tregs) which express Ly49 inhibitory receptors and HELIOS. These killer-like Tregs are clonally diverse and carry T cell receptors associated with self-reactivity and response to hydrophobicity. cDC1 or CD8 deletion promoted CD62L+CCR7+ naïve T cell retention and B cell recruitment to injured muscle. These naïve T cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, strongly correlate with B cell abundance in the muscle and are selectively pruned by CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs. Furthermore, clinically used materials that promote wound healing enrich CD8+/-Ly49+ Treg function whereas those that are associated with pathology promote naïve T cell and B cell accumulation. We hypothesize that CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs maintain self-tolerance after tissue damage and avert autoimmunity by eliminating naive T cells and preventing pathogenic B cell activation.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HPV-negative HNSCC, which arises in the upper airway mucosa, is particularly aggressive, with nearly half of patients succumbing to the disease within five years and limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to other cancers. There is a need to further explore the complex immune landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here, we integrated two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 29 samples and nearly 300,000 immune cells to investigate immune cell dynamics across tumor progression and lymph node metastasis. Notable shifts toward adaptative immune cell populations were observed in the 14 distinct HNSCC-associated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) and 21 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) considering disease stages. All PBMCs and TICs revealed unique molecular signatures correlating with lymph node involvement; however, broadly, TICs increased ligand expression among effector cytokines, growth factors, and interferon-related genes. Pathway analysis comparing PBMCs and TICs further confirmed active cell signaling among Monocyte-Macrophage, Dendritic cell, Natural Killer (NK), and T cell populations. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed significant communication patterns shifts among TICs, between CD8+ T cells and NK cells, showing heightened immunosuppressive signaling that correlated with disease progression. In locally invasive HPV-negative HNSCC samples, highly multiplexed immunofluorescence assays highlighted peri-tumoral clustering of exhausted CD8+ T and NK cells, alongside their exclusion from intra-tumoral niches. These findings emphasize cytotoxic immune cells as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the mechanisms by which the HNSCC sustainably evades immune responses.">

        <tr id="The significance of endogenous immune surveillance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains controversial. Using clinical B-ALL samples and a novel mouse model, we show that neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells are induced to adopt type-1 regulatory (Tr1) function in the leukemia microenvironment. Tr1s then inhibit cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, preventing effective leukemia clearance. Leukemic cells induce Tr1s by phenocopying hematopoietic stem cells, which normally are subject to effective surveillance by this CD4+ subset. This mechanism effectively redirects Tr1 cells from a role in preventing cancer to maladaptively promoting clinical relapse. In mouse models, inhibition of Tr1 expansion with IL10 receptor (IL10R) blockade is insufficient to improve leukemia control. In contrast, combined therapy with a cytotoxic agent and anti-PDL1 blockade eradicated measurable residual disease. This correlates with polarization of the neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cell population from Tr1 towards Th1 states. Our findings uncover a mechanism that enables leukemic relapse and resolves existing controversies on the role of immune surveillance towards this cancer type. Therapeutic polarization of neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells towards Th1 states may improve contemporary immune therapies by reshaping the immune microenvironment towards states permissive for cytotoxic attack of residual leukemia. Key Points B-ALL induces neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells to adopt Type-1 regulatory states, which protect leukemic cells from immune pressure. Repolarizing neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cells towards Th1 states eradicates measurable residual disease.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR-T cell treatment remains incompletely understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analyses of bone marrow-resident immune cells from B-ALL patients before and after CAR T-cell treatment. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation, including an increase in myeloid cells. Significant induction of the IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells. PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response in the cohort of patients analyzed. Further, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell dysfunction. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells led to increased accumulation of human MDSCs, exacerbation of a hypoxic environment and T-cell exhaustion in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. In conclusion, CAR T-cell-mediated myeloid activation is associated with pathways of immune dysregulation that may antagonize the effects of therapy. Key points The tumor immune context post-treatment affects CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling result in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromise CAR T-cell efficacy.">

Intratumoral delivery of synthetic STING agonists induces IFN-I dependent tumor regression in preclinical cancer models and is being tested clinically. In this study, we investigate the role of monocytic lineage (MCs) cells in response to STING agonist induced IFN-I signaling. We show that CCR2-deficient mice, lacking inflammatory MCs in the periphery, or Lyz2-Cre-IFNAR1fl/fl mice in which IFN-I signaling in monocytes is reduced, exhibit impaired responses to STING agonist therapy of MC38 and/or B16F10 tumors. STING agonist treatment induced CCR5-dependent migration of MCs carrying tumor antigen from the tumor to the lymph nodes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45+ cells from lymph nodes and tumors of mice in which half the hematopoietic cells lack the interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1) revealed that STING agonist therapy induces intrinsic IFNAR1-dependent acquisition of an inflammatory monocytic cell phenotype distinct from inflammatory cDC and a reduction in macrophages with a pro-tumor TGFβ/angiogenesis transcriptome. IL-18 - IL-18R1 interaction was the top predicted interaction between monocytic lineage cells and CD8+T cells or NK cells. Blocking IL-18 reduced the therapeutic efficacy of STING agonist treatment in CCR2+/+ but not CCR2-/- mice, implicating IL-18 production by the monocytes in STING agonist therapy of melanoma. These findings support a pivotal role for IL-18 producing inflammatory monocytic lineage cells in tumor control following STING agonist treatment.">

        <tr id="High-dose steroids constitute the cornerstone of first-line treatment for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, but compromise antitumor immunity. A deeper understanding of irAEs and their response to steroids can contribute to more targeted irAE management regimens. We took a multi-omics approach to identify blood- and tissue-based predictors of steroid response and to explore underlying mechanisms of steroid non-response in irAEs. In the blood, steroid non-response correlated with trends for elevated Tc1/Tc17 CD8+ T cells and serum interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 prior to initiation of steroids, along with persistent (CD8+) T cell proliferation and activation after start of steroids. A remarkably fast decrease in inflammatory gene signatures and lymphocyte infiltration was observed in colitis tissue of steroid responders obtained within 24h after initiation of steroids. Peripheral T cell PD-1 receptor occupancy was not associated with steroid response. Colitis tissue of steroid non-responders was enriched for activated CD4+ memory T cells and a pronounced type 1/17 immune response. Together, our findings suggest rapid immunological effects of steroids in circulating cells and irAE-affected tissue and support that an enhanced type 1/type 17 response is associated with steroid non-response in irAEs.">

        <tr id="Our understanding of the heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIBs) evolves in parallel with the advances in high-dimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Subpopulations of TIBs have been described with diverse and even opposite roles in tumor control, based on surface molecule, cytokine and transcriptional factor expression. Furthermore, recently the predictive role of IgA and IgG expression in tumors was shown for melanoma and KRAS-mutated, but not KRAS wild type, lung adenocarcinoma. This may imply that B cells producing different immunoglobulin isotypes also acquire different functional characteristics that have unequal effects on tumor microenvironment (TME) and differentially affect tumor progression. To address this question, we performed comparative bulk transcriptome analysis of tumor-infiltrating surface-IgA+ (sIgA+) and sIgG+ memory B cells from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors. We identified FCRL4, PDCD1 and RUNX2 among genes overexpressed in IgA+ B cells, which suggests exhausted, chronically antigen-stimulated phenotype. Using public scRNA-seq data, we showed that FCRL4-expressing memory TIBs form a distinct cluster of cells with transcriptomic profile characterized by upregulation of genes involved in IFNγ and IFNα responses. sIgG+ B cells, on the other hand, overexpress IL5RA, consistent with the role of IL-5 in class-switch recombination to IgG isotype. Moreover, based on the analysis of the TCGA LUAD cohort, we found that FCRL4 to CD20 expression ratio correlates with lower overall survival, further strengthening the view on FCRL4 as a marker of exhausted dysfunctional TIBs. Our findings support the initial hypothesis that IgA/IgG ratio in tumors is not merely an indication of cytokine environment in the TME, but also reflects the difference in the functional characteristics of the respective B cell populations.">

It is accompanied by significant perturbations in various B cell subsets, such as increased frequencies of immature/transitional B cells, activated memory B cells, atypical memory B cells, short-lived plasmablasts and regulatory B cells, as well as by decreased frequencies of resting memory and resting naïve B cells. Furthermore, both memory and antigen-inexperienced naïve B cells show exhausted and immune-senescent phenotypes. HIV also drives the expansion and functional impairment of CD4+ T follicular helper cells, which provide help to B cells, crucial for the generation of germinal center reactions and production of long-lived plasma and memory B cells. By suppressing viral replication, anti-retroviral therapy reverses the virus-induced perturbations and functional defects, albeit inadequately. Due to HIV’s lingering impact on B cells, immune senescence and residual chronic inflammation, people with HIV (PWH), especially immune non-responders, are immunocompromised and mount suboptimal antibody responses to vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review how functionally and phenotypically distinct B cell subsets are induced in response to a vaccine and an infection and how HIV infection and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) impact them. We also review the role played by HIV-induced defects and perturbations in B cells in the induction of humoral immune responses to currently used anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in PWH on ART. We also outline different strategies that could potentially enhance the vaccine-induced antibody responses in PWH. The review will provide guidance and impetus for further research to improve the immunogenicity of these vaccines in this human population.">

        <tr id="Resistance to immunotherapy is a cardinal feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Inhibition of Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO), a post-translational modification with important immune regulatory functions, augments responsiveness to immunotherapy in non-PDAC models via pro-immunogenic effects on myeloid cells, cancer cells, and T-cells. Recently, it has been reported that SUMO inhibition has direct immunogenic effects on PDAC. Here, we report that the novel combination of SUMO inhibition with a small molecule, TAK-981, plus antibody-mediated CD40 agonism improves survival in an aggressive orthotopic mouse model of PDAC by enhancing anti-tumoral immunogenicity. This combination amplifies CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration and induces significant changes among macrophages. TAK-981 also leads to enhanced cancer specific MHC-I expression both in vitro and in vivo by augmenting interferon signaling. We show that the improvement in survival is mediated by macrophages. Our findings show that SUMO inhibition complements CD40 agonism to enhance immune activity in PDAC via interferon signaling, improving survival in an aggressive pre-clinical model of PDAC and translating previous findings to a characteristically immunosuppressive and highly aggressive solid malignancy.">

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="The identification of immune environments and cellular interactions in the colon microenvironment is essential for understanding the mechanisms of chronic inflammatory disease. Despite occurring in the same organ, there is a significant gap in understanding the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Our study aims to address the distinct immunopathological response of UC and CRC. Using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we analyzed the profiles of immune cells in colorectal tissues obtained from healthy donors, UC patients, and CRC patients. The colon tissues from patients and healthy participants were visualized by immunostaining followed by laser confocal microscopy for select targets. Natural killer (NK) cells from UC patients on medication showed reduced cytotoxicity compared to those from healthy individuals. Nonetheless, a UC-specific pathway called the BAG6-NCR3 axis led to higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased the cytotoxicity of NCR3+ NK cells, thereby contributing to the persistence of colitis. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), both NK cells and CD8+ T cells exhibited significant changes in cytotoxicity and exhaustion. The GALECTIN-9 (LGALS9)-HAVCR2 axis was identified as one of the CRC-specific pathways. Within this pathway, NK cells solely communicated with myeloid cells under CRC conditions. HAVCR2+ NK cells from CRC patients suppressed NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating a reduction in immune surveillance. Overall, we elucidated the comprehensive UC and CRC immune microenvironments and NK cell-mediated immune responses. Our findings can aid in selecting therapeutic targets that increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Lymphatic vessels play a crucial role in activating anti-tumor immune surveillance but also contribute to metastasis and systemic tumor progression. Whether distinct lymphatic phenotypes exist that govern the switch between immunity and metastasis remains unclear. Here we reveal that cytotoxic immunity normalizes lymphatic function and uncouples immune and metastatic potential. We find that in mice and humans, intratumoral lymphatic vessel density negatively correlates with productive cytotoxic immune responses and identify IFNγ as an intrinsic inhibitor of lymphangiogenesis. Specific deletion of the Ifngr1 in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) greatly expanded the intratumoral lymphatic network and drove the emergence of a tip-like endothelial state, promoting lymph node metastasis but not dendritic cell migration. IFNγ inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, which is required for proliferation and acquisition of the pathologic transcriptional state. Our data indicate that IFNγ induces a phenotypic switch in tumor-associated lymphatic vessels to reinforce canonical immune surveillance and block metastasis.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical for immunosurveillance yet become dysfunctional in contexts such as chronic stimulation by viral infections or cancer. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Tumor clearance by T cells is impaired by insufficient tumor antigen recognition, insufficient tumor infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance by these T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promises to reverse T cell suppression in the TME and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. CPIs require the target pathway of inhibition to be active in the TME to elicit a therapeutic response. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of serial killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function against HR+ cancers. Our model provides a means to optimize targets for CPIs used in combination with BATs in clinical strategies. What is already known on this topic Bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapies are adoptive T cell therapies that can effectively reroute T cell cytotoxicity toward cancerous cells, but lack consistent and durable anti-tumor responses. Checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of activated T cells dampen immune responses and can be overstimulated in solid tumors to hamper tumor clearance by T cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs can improve T cell anti-tumor response by blocking checkpoint protein signaling but are only effective if the targeted checkpoint protein is expressed on the T cell and activated in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an opportunity to enhance BAT efficacy by combining treatment with synergistic CPI. What this study adds This study characterizes dynamic, time-resolved patterns in checkpoint protein expression by breast cancer-targeting adoptive T cells and predicts the significance of high-prevalence checkpoint proteins on T cell function. It also demonstrates the use of multivariate statistic and mathematical modeling toward rational design of targets and timing strategies for synergistic combination therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy The output of this study provides justification for therapeutic strategies combining adoptive T cell therapies with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting TIGIT and LAG3 as a means of improving patient responses in HER2-/HR+ breast cancers.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for over a million deaths annually. Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-γ timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-γ exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced anti-mycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial clearance. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function. Author Summary Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a major global health threat. While most people exposed to MTB successfully fight off the infection, some individuals develop active disease. Understanding how the bacteria evade immune defenses is key to developing better treatments. In this study, we identify a new role for c-Myc, a protein well-known in cancer research, in suppressing the ability of immune cells called macrophages to fight MTB. Macrophages are responsible for engulfing and killing bacteria, but we found that c-Myc interferes with this process, allowing MTB to survive. Using a small peptide inhibitor called Omomyc, we were able to block c-Myc activity, which restored macrophages’ ability to kill MTB. This effect is linked to changes in cellular metabolism, leading to the increased production of molecules essential for bacterial destruction. We also discovered that high c-Myc levels are associated with persistent MTB infection in both mouse models and human tissues. This suggests that c-Myc helps the bacteria evade immune attack, contributing to long-term infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism exploited by MTB to survive in the body and suggest that targeting c-Myc could be a promising approach to enhancing immune defenses against TB. By bridging insights from cancer biology and infectious disease research, our work provides a new perspective on tackling TB and highlights c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for boosting immunity against this deadly infection.">

This highlights the needs to develop novel therapy for HIV-1 related diseases in PWH. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of CD24-Fc, a fusion protein with anti-inflammatory properties that interacts with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and siglec-10, in chronic HIV-1 infection model using humanized mice undergoing suppressive cART. Our findings show that CD24-Fc treatment significantly reduced inflammation and immune hyperactivation in vivo when combined with cART. CD24-Fc mediated resolution of inflammation was associated with improved recovery of CD4 T cells, reduced immune activation, restored central memory T cells and reversal of immune cell exhaustion phenotype. Notably, CD24-Fc treatment rescued CXCR5+ CD8 central memory T cell (TCM) which correlated with increased polyfunctionality in HIV-specific T cells in humanized mice and in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWH. This restoration of CXCR5+ memory CD8 T cells was associated with HIV replication inhibition, delayed viral rebound and reduced HIV-1 pathogenesis upon cART cessation. This study suggests that CD24-Fc treatment could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for managing chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH. Author summary Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) cannot block viral gene expression from activated HIV proviral DNA in reservoir cells, contributing to chronic immune activation and inflammation associated diseases in people with HIV (PWH). The therapeutic treatment of anti-inflammatory fusion protein CD24-Fc in humanized mice during suppressive cART (i) resolves inflammation and chronic HIV-1 immune pathogenesis during suppressive cART, (ii) rescues CXCR5-expressing CD8 memory T cells and enhances antiviral response in humanized mice and PWH PBMCs, (iii) delays virus rebound and reduces viral pathogenesis after cART cessation. Thus, CD24-Fc could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD1) can be effective in treating advanced cancers. However, many patients do not respond and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B-cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially co-localize with T-cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We discover that pre-treatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing.

        <tr id="Durable T cell immunity against cancer depends on the continual replenishment of effector CD8+ T cells. Thymic output has been correlated with favorable prognosis in cancer patients across a range of ages, suggesting that the thymus is an important source for replenishing T cells capable of controlling cancer progression. However, the effector potential of thymic mature CD8+ T cells and their regulation have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identified the ability of thymic single positive CD8+ T cells to gain effector potential after thymic selection, but they are subject to the regulation of PD-1. We found a previously undisclosed role of PD-1 in limiting both the cytotoxic and exhaustion potential of thymic and peripheral CD8+ T cells. Our results show that although PD-1 inhibition facilitates the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, effector CD8+ cells gradually lose their antitumor activity within tumor tissues due to advanced exhaustion in the absence of PD-1. Thus, although the preset effector potential in thymic mature CD8+ T cells allows them to rapidly respond to malignant cells in the periphery, PD-1, as a checkpoint, is embedded in the thymic mature CD8+ T cells after positive selection to balance their effector function from exaggeration and exhaustion. Therefore, we propose that a strategy capable of upholding the cytotoxic capacity and avoiding exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during the early stages of PD-1 inhibition therapy is needed to achieve durable antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Unveiling the systemic effects of disease and health requires an holistic approach that has mainly revolved around well established, directly determinable molecular relationships such as the protein synthesis cascade and epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, involving 394 individuals, we found direct linkage of branches spanning human biological functions often not studied in conjunction, using clinical data, gut microbial abundances, blood immune cell repertoires, blood transcriptomic and blood T cell receptor data. Contrary to current paradigms, we demonstrate that immunotypes and enterotypes are orthogonal, likely fulfilling distinct roles in maintaining homeostasis, only bridged via the blood transcriptome. We also identified two distinct inflammatory profiles: the first driven by interferon signalling and the other characterised by non-viral, NF-kB and IL-6 markers. Lastly, we present compelling data showing strong associations of the Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae bacteria with a healthy immunotype and transcriptomic pattern, highlighting their potential role in immune health.

        <tr id="Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that in humans can be broadly classified into two main subtypes based on their unique TCRδ chain, Vδ1 and Vδ2. Both subsets have potent anti-tumor properties and the presence of Vδ1 cells in the tumor is often associated with positive prognosis. Herein, we investigated the molecular interplay between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), IC blockade (ICB) therapy and γδ T cells. We show that ICRs display differential expression and regulation by the JAK-STAT pathway in circulating Vδ1 and Vδ2 cells and identify constitutive (e.g. TIGIT, PD-1) and inducible (e.g. TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4) ICRs. In melanoma, Vδ1 cells, especially in patients who did not respond to ICB or required combination therapy, expressed high levels of ICR, TOX and inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) transcripts, reminiscent of an exhaustion transcriptional signature. At the same time all γδ T cells had a prominent downregulation in AP-1 transcription factors. Patient derived cells were functionally competent, although induction of LAG-3 and CTLA-4 was impaired. In the context of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Vδ1 cells specifically bound high levels of therapeutic antibody but only in patients who responded to treatment, revealing a potential new prognostic marker for evaluating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Finally, expression of KIR genes in Vδ1 cells was downregulated in response to successful ICB therapy. Collectively, our data indicate an intricate relationship between ICRs, putatively also KIRs, and γδ T cells and reveal novel approaches by which these cells can be harnessed in order to discern or improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="It is established that BCG vaccination results in the development of both a specific immune response to mycobacterial infections and a nonspecific (heterologous) immune response, designated as trained immunity (TRIM), to other pathogens. We hypothesized that local BCG immunization may induce an early immune response in bone marrow and spleen innate immunity cells. The early transcriptomic response of various populations of innate immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells, to BCG vaccination was examined. To this end, C57Bl/6J mice were subcutaneously immunized with 106 CFU of BCG. Three days following BCG administration, the three cell populations were collected from the control and BCG-vaccinated groups using FACS. All cell populations obtained were utilized for the preparation and sequencing of RNA-seq libraries. The analysis of FACS data revealed an increase in the proportion of splenic NK cells and monocytes 3 days post-vaccination. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the deregulation of genes associated with the regulation of immune response (according to Gene Ontology terms) in NK cells, monocytes, and unsorted bone marrow cells. Two NK cell-specific immune ligands (Tnfsf14 and S100a8) and two bone marrow-specific immune receptors (C5ar1 and Csf2rb) were identified among differentially expressed genes. No alterations were identified in neutrophils in either their percentage or at the transcriptomic level. Thus, in this study, we demonstrated that BCG vaccination provides an early increase in the proportion of murine bone marrow and spleen immune cell populations, as well as transcriptomic alterations in monocytes, NK cells, and non-sorted bone marrow cells. This early innate immune response may be beneficial for enhancing TRIM.">

        <tr id="Repeated antigen exposure leads to T-cell exhaustion, a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cellular state marked by loss of effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity, cytokine production/release), up-regulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1), and reduced proliferative capacity. Molecular pathways underlying T-cell exhaustion have been defined for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but which factors drive exhaustion in CD4+ T cells, that are also required for an effective immune response against a tumor or infection, remains unclear. Here, we utilize quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular basis of the dysfunctional cell state induced by chronic stimulation of CD4+ memory T cells. We identified a dynamic response encompassing both known and novel up-regulated cell surface receptors, as well as dozens of unexpected transcriptional regulators. Integrated causal network analysis of our combined data predicts the histone acetyltransferase p300 as a driver of aspects of this phenotype following chronic stimulation, which we confirmed via targeted small molecule inhibition. While our integrative analysis also revealed large-scale metabolic reprogramming, our independent investigation confirmed a global remodeling away from glycolysis to a dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation-based metabolism coincident with oxidative stress. Overall, these data provide both insights into the mechanistic basis of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and serve as a valuable resource for future interventional studies aimed at modulating T-cell dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Patients with cancer often receive chemotherapy to control tumor progression and reduce disease symptoms. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents not only kill rapidly growing cancer cells but also reduce normal cells including myeloid cells, the main innate immune population involved in fighting infections and repairing tissue damages. Rapid loss of myeloid cells caused by chemotherapy triggers myelopoiesis, a process in which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow regenerate myeloid cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, to reconstitute the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported that chemotherapy with an alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice leads to repopulation of myeloid cells that acquire immunosuppressive activities within the monocyte subset. However, detailed information on the cellular composition and molecular identity of these chemotherapy- induced immunosuppressive monocytes is lacking. Here, we investigated how the various myeloid cell subsets in the bone marrow of mice respond to CTX chemotherapy through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq). We found that myeloid progenitor cells and monocytes were reduced 2 days after chemotherapy but rebounded and surpassed their pretreatment levels by day 7. Further scRNAseq analysis of pre-enriched monocytes revealed that the monocyte population was heterogenous, and that chemotherapy tilted myelopoiesis towards the production of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo). We identified Cxcr4 and Cx3cr1 as suitable markers for isolation of chemotherapy-induced NeuMo and demonstrated that these cells were suppressive to T cells. Together with the evidence that CTX-induced monocytes can promote breast cancer metastasis in mice, our data reveal the heterogeneity of the monocytes reemerging after chemotherapy and identify the NeuMo subset as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer.">

We previously showed, in immunodeficient context, that antimitotic chemotherapy induced cGAS/STING pathway amplifying antitumor response through a paracrine IFN-1 secretome. We herein studied tumor progression and response to treatment using an immunocompetent murine model. scRNAseq analysis revealed that paclitaxel treatment altered tumor cell phenotypes, favoring tumor cells with a gene expression signature indicative of active NF-κB pathway with secretory phenotype. Treatment coincidently reduced IFN-I signature cells during tumor progression. The resulting secretory shift correlated with neutrophil recruitment to the tumor, particularly CXCR2+ neutrophils, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 receptor by navarixin reactivated antitumor immunity, enhancing NK cell infiltration and tumor cytotoxicity. Navarixin combination with paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor volume and metastasis. Targeting the NF-κB-driven secretory phenotype, in particular through neutrophil modulation, holds promise for improving TNBC treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune cells determine the role of the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression, either suppressing tumor formation or promoting tumorigenesis. We analyzed the profile of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of control mouse skins and skin tumors at the single-cell level. We identified 15 CD45+ immune cell clusters, which broadly represent the most functionally characterized immune cell types including macrophages, Langerhans cells (LC), conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2), migratory/mature dendritic cells (mDC), dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC), dermal γδ T cells (γδT), T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer cells (NK), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), neutrophils (Neu), mast cells (Mast), and two proliferating populations (Prolif.1 and Prolif.2). Skin tumor progression reprogramed immune cells and led to a marked increase in the relative percentages of macrophages, cDC2, mDC, Tregs, and Neu. Macrophages, the largest cell cluster of immune cells in skin tumors. In addition, macrophages emerged as the predominant communication ‘hub’ in skin tumors, highlighting the importance of macrophages during skin tumor progression. In contrast, other immune cell clusters decreased during skin tumor progression, including DETC, γδT, ILC2, and LC. In addition, skin tumor progression dramatically upregulated Jak2/Stat3 expression and the interferon response across various immune cell clusters. Further, skin tumor progression activated T cells and NK cells indicated by elevated expression of IFN-γ and Granzyme B in skin tumors. Meanwhile, a pronounced infiltration of M2-macrophages and Tregs in skin tumors created an immunosuppressive microenvironment, consistent with the elevated expression of the Stat3 pathway in skin tumors. In summary, our study elucidates the immune cell landscape of epidermal neoplasms, offering a comprehensive understanding of the immune response during skin tumor progression and providing new insights into cancer immune evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background Hepatocellular carcinoma represents a significant global health challenge, affecting over a million patients annually, arising mainly from chronic liver diseases, with a majority being related to viral infections. However, despite the groundbreaking clinical results of immune checkpoint blockades and adoptive cell therapies, we still face non-responders accompanied by high rebound rates after resection. Considering that the main concern is to overcome a highly specialized immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of the individual patient, the characterization of the particular tumor microenvironment and the source of the immune cells used in ACT is of immense importance. Approved ACT therapies mainly use modified peripheral blood cells from individuals. At the same time, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are underrepresented even if they have garnered interest due to their potential to target tumor-specific antigens more effectively. Methods In this study, we employed allogenic and autologous immune cell sources for expansion and stimulation, resulting in adoptive T-cell transfer experiments determining the effector cell differentiation and the related anti-tumor effects by the possible implementation of re-stimulation. Results We determined a high success rate in expanding and stimulating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with consistent CD8 T-cell fractions from HCC patients. To showcase the effectiveness of stimulated T-cells from different sources, we generated cell lines derived from the margin and center of an HBV-induced HCC with a highly immune-suppressive TME. We found effective immune responses supported by cell death induction, ferroptosis, proptosis and apoptosis triggered by all sources of T-cells depending on the area of derived tumor cells. Conclusion Effector T-cell fractions derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes present a viable source for cell-based immune therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in HCC patients, especially after resection, to suppress rebound strategies of the parental tumor on an individual level.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) rarely respond to ICB. Accumulating evidence indicates that the complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacts the efficacy of ICB therapy. Therefore, investigating how TME components in MM influence ICB treatment is urgent. Methods We employed two well-established murine myeloma models, 5TGM1 and Vk*MYC, by intravenously injecting 5TGM1 or Vk*MYC cells into mice, respectively, to determine ICB therapeutic efficacy in MM. Total mouse IgG or Ig2b ELISA or QuickGel split beta SPE kits and in vivo bioluminescent imaging were used to monitor MM tumor burden. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) was used to quantify MM TME components. T cell proliferation and function were detected using flow cytometry. Peptide-Fc fusion proteins were used to deplete myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MMDTR, Foxp3DTR, CD4 KO and CD8 KO mice were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Gene expression levels in human MM were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus public datasets. Results We found that programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody treatment had a therapeutic effect in 5TGM1 mice; it was ineffective in Vk*MYC mice. CyTOF indicated that the bone marrow (BM) of both models was inflamed, suggesting that immune suppressive cells might be inhibiting the reactivation of T cells in the BM. We observed higher numbers of MDSCs, regulatory T (Treg) cells, and tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) in myeloma BM compared with that of tumor-free mice. Specifically, depleting MDSCs, but not Treg cells or TAMs, sensitized Vk*MYC mice and enhanced the response of 5TGM1 mice to PD-1 ICB, which was dependent on CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells. MDSCs, especially M-MDSCs and CD84+ MDSCs, significantly inhibited the activation and cytotoxic cytokine production of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Moreover, database profiling of patient BM revealed a negative correlation between MDSCs signature genes and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell signature genes, with post-maintenance patients with myeloma displaying a higher ratio of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell to MDSCs signature genes compared with pretreated patients. Conclusion Our study highlights the potential of MDSCs depletion in enhancing the sensitivity of patients with myeloma to PD-1 ICB therapy.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

The nutrient-limited conditions of the TME, particularly the scarcity of glucose, amino acids, and lipids, challenge cancer cell survival1–4. However, the metabolic constraints faced by immune and stromal cells in comparison to cancer cells, and how these limitations affect therapeutic outcomes, remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce Dual Ribosome Profiling (DualRP), a method that allows for simultaneous analysis of translation and identification of ribosome stalling, revealing amino acid shortages in different cell types within tumors. Using DualRP, we uncover that interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts trigger an inflammatory response, mitigating amino acid limitations during glucose starvation. In immunocompetent mouse models, we observe that immune checkpoint blockade therapy induces serine and glycine restrictions specifically in T cells, but not in cancer cells. We further demonstrate that these amino acids are essential for optimal T cell function both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting their critical role in effective immunotherapy. Our findings show that therapeutic interventions create distinct metabolic demands across different tumor cell types, with nutrient availability significantly influencing the success of immunotherapy. DualRP’s ability to explore cell type-specific metabolic vulnerabilities offers a promising tool for advancing our understanding of tumor biology and improving therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Although tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) has been recognized as an attractive next-generation candidate target for cancer immunotherapy, the factors that regulate the gene expression and their mechanistic effects on tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Treg cells) remain poorly understood. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was employed to analyze the phenotypic and functional differences between TNFR2+ Treg cells and TNFR2− Treg cells. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) from humans and mouse was used to investigate the potential mechanisms by which lactate regulates TNFR2 expression. Results Treg cells with high TNFR2 expression exhibited elevated levels of immune checkpoint molecules. Additionally, the high expression of TNFR2 on Treg cells was positively correlated with a poor prognosis in MPE patients. Moreover, we revealed that lactate upregulated TNFR2 expression on Treg cells, thereby enhancing their immunosuppressive function in MPE. Mechanistically, lactate modulated the gene transcription of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65) through histone H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la), subsequently upregulating the gene expression of TNFR2 and expediting the progression of MPE. Notably, lactate metabolism blockade combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy effectively enhanced the efficacy of ICB therapy, prolonged the survival time of MPE mice, and improved immunosuppression in the microenvironment of MPE. Conclusions The study explains the mechanism that regulates TNFR2 expression on Treg cells and its function in MPE progression, providing novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of tumor development and metabolic strategies for MPE treatment by targeting lactate metabolism in Treg cells.">

Methods PBMC derived from 10 HCC patients and two healthy donors were used for expansion in small bioreactors equipped with a permeable membrane for 2 weeks.

We extracted the enriched complement of one chronically infected patient to elucidate the therapeutic potential. Results We successfully expanded the effector T-cell subsets for all investigated samples and consistently enriched the cell amount over time. Subsequently, we showed that the expanded patient-derived T-cells showed functionality against autologous liver cancer-derived cells by inducing receptor and protein-mediated cell death.

        <tr id="To initiate T cell-mediated immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) present antigens to specific T cells through the establishment of an immune synapse (IS). While the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of the IS on the T cell side are well understood, how IS components are organized at the DC membrane remain ill-defined. Galectins, a family of β-galactoside binding proteins, modulate immune cell function via the establishment of specific glycan-dependent or independent interactions. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms that underlie galectin function are poorly described and very little is known regarding their contribution to DC-mediated T cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that intracellular galectin-9 (gal9) in DCs is required for T cell activation. Murine and human DCs lacking gal9 showed impaired induction of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cell proliferation, suggesting a conserved function for gal9 in modulating DC–T cell interactions. Live-cell imaging revealed that galectin-9-depleted DCs fail to establish stable ISs with T cells, resulting in reduced T cell activation and proliferation. Unbiased co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified HLA-II as a gal9 binding partner in DCs, and we observed a marked reduction of HLA-II recruitment to the immune synapse in DCs lacking gal9. Conditional gal9 knockout in DCs led to enhanced tumor growth in vivo, compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, underscoring a role for gal9 in T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, this study provides the first detailed account of gal9-mediated HLA-II organization at the synaptic site of DCs, revealing a novel mechanism by which galectins orchestrate immune receptor positioning from within the cytoplasm to enhance CD4+ T cell activation.">

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) augment T-cell responses to tumour cells and have transformed treatment paradigms in cancer. However, CPI frequently trigger autoimmune like events, including potentially life-threatening colitis. Current immunosuppressive treatments for CPI- colitis (CPI-c) incur significant side effects and may even reduce CPI efficacy. New treatments are urgently needed.



 Changes at gene level, pathway level (GSEA) and predicted upstream regulators (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis-IPA), and enrichment scores (Gene Set Variation Analysis-GSVA) were investigated in colonic biopsies (RNA-sequencing) from patients with CPI-c (n=12), CPI (no colitis) (n=6), healthy controls (n=13) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (n=12). Potentially relevant pathways were functionally tested in preclinical disease models. CPI-c was induced in mice transplanted with a pro-inflammatory microbiota and administered anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 intraperitoneally (i.p). Anti-IL1R (anakinra), MCC950 (inflammasome inhibitor) and anti-IL27 were administered i.p. Colonic leukocytes were extracted to interrogate myeloid and lymphocyte compartments by flow cytometry. Whole colon segments were processed for histology.



 In CPI-c patients, IL-1B was the top differentially expressed cytokine at gene level with interleukin-1 signalling significantly enriched at pathway level. IPA also identified IL-1B and IL-27 as predicted upstream activators. Interestingly, in vivo blockade of IL-1B, or the inflammasome (MCC950), had no impact on colitis.
 Administration of IL-27-neutralising antibodies at the onset of CPI-colitis in mice, reduced disease susceptibility and improved histological colitis scores. This was associated with decreased infiltration of colonic lamina propria neutrophils, Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes and the number of CD8+ IFNg+ T-cells. Conversely, administering neutralising anti-IL27 during established CPI-colitis did not ameliorate disease and was linked to an enhanced CD4+ effector response characterised by heightened production of TNFa and IFNg.
 Further analysis of colonic biopsies of CPI-c patients confirmed enrichment of IL27-responsive genes which we localised to CD8+ resident memory and CD8+ cytotoxic cells in single cell RNA-seq analyses. Additionally, serum IL-27 levels were significantly elevated in CPI-c patients.



 IL-1B signalling was shown to be dispensable to disease in mice. However, IL-27 signalling has a context specific role, serving as a functionally important activator of innate immune responses, while inhibiting later phases of acquired immunity via suppressing cytotoxic lymphocyte responses. Targeting IL-27 presents an attractive therapeutic approach for CPI-c given its potential tumourogenic effects.

Its subset that contains the surface receptor CD8, also called cytotoxic T cells, functions to facilitate tumor cell elimination. Chronic exposure of CD8+ T cells to antigens and inflammation can cause the T cells to lose their functions as well as changes in their surface expressions, named T cell exhaustion (Tex). This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of this cellular process and the influence of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on it. This article focuses on the mechanism of action of the four major upregulated immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) and introduces ICB therapies targeting each ICP. Based on these mechanisms, scientists have suggested various interventions to reverse T-cell exhaustion. Recent clinical data show that although ICB therapy has significant efficacy in some patients, its limitations in patient selection limit the popularization of the treatment effect. ICB which curbs Tex by blocking the signal pathways that suppress T cell functions, summarizes the current understandings and progress, and identifies the gaps on this topic.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are a promising new class of therapeutics for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. A frequently observed, yet incompletely understood effect of this treatment is the transient reduction of circulating T cell counts, also known as T cell margination (TCM). After administration of the GPRC5D-targeting TCB forimtamig (RG6234), TCM occurred in patients and correlated with cytokine release and soluble B cell maturation antigen decrease. We demonstrate that TCM is accurately represented in the humanized NSG mouse model and occurs at a lower threshold of target expression than systemic cytokine release. Application of whole-mouse tissue clearing and 3D imaging revealed that T cells accumulate in the bone marrow after treatment. We hypothesize that low amounts of targets are sufficient to rapidly redirect T cells upon TCB engagement. Therefore, we propose TCM as a beneficial, highly sensitive and early effect of forimtamig that leads T cells to likely sites of bone marrow tumor lesions.">

Pro- and anti-inflammatory TAMs are central to cancer progression by shaping inflammation and immune (im)balance, but it remains unknown if polarization-induced remodeling of the TAM glycocalyx critical for cellular communication occurs within the TME. Taking a systems glycobiology approach, we here firstly used cell surface-focused glycomics and lectin flow cytometry of ex vivo polarized monocyte-derived macrophages to demonstrate profound sialyl linkage switching of the surface N-glycome in pro-inflammatory (α2,3-sialo-favored) and anti-inflammatory (α2,6-sialo-dominant) macrophages. In contrast, no polarization-induced alterations in sialylation were observed in the surface O-glycome. ST6GAL1 that modifies N-glycans with α2,6-sialylation was elevated in anti-inflammatory compared to levels in pro-inflammatory macrophages providing a mechanistic basis for the sialyl linkage switching, which was supported by ST6GAL1 silencing. Interestingly, SNA-focused lectin cytochemistry of anti-inflammatory macrophages revealed dense networks of dynamic α2,6-sialylated protein-based nanotubules forming inter-connecting cellular structures that were absent in pro-inflammatory macrophages. Temporal ST6GAL1 silencing in anti-inflammatory macrophages caused nanotubule disintegration as evidenced by SNA and biotin fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, live cell recordings of anti-inflammatory macrophages cultured with and without colorectal cancer (CRC) cells showed reduced macrophage motility, attenuated inter-macrophage and macrophage-CRC cell interactions and diminished CRC cell proliferation upon ST6GAL1 disruption indicating functional roles of the α2,6-sialylated nanotubules.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but their use is limited by the development of autoimmunity in healthy tissues as a side effect of treatment. Such immune-related adverse events (IrAE) contribute to hospitalizations, cancer treatment interruption and even premature death. ICI-induced autoimmune diabetes mellitus (ICI-T1DM) is a life-threatening IrAE that presents with rapid pancreatic beta-islet cell destruction leading to hyperglycemia and life-long insulin dependence. While prior reports have focused on CD8+ T cells, the role for CD4+ T cells in ICI-T1DM is less understood. Here, we identify expansion CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells expressing interleukin 21 (IL-21) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) as a hallmark of ICI-T1DM. Furthermore, we show that both IL-21 and IFNγ are critical cytokines for autoimmune attack in ICI-T1DM. Because IL-21 and IFNγ both signal through JAK-STAT pathways, we reasoned that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) may protect against ICI-T1DM. Indeed, JAKi provide robust in vivo protection against ICI-T1DM in a mouse model that is associated with decreased islet-infiltrating Tfh cells. Moreover, JAKi therapy impaired Tfh cell differentiation in patients with ICI-T1DM. These studies highlight CD4+ Tfh cells as underrecognized but critical mediators of ICI-T1DM that may be targeted with JAKi to prevent this grave IrAE. VISUAL ABSTRACT">

        <tr id="Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.">

        <tr id="Peritoneal tissue-resident macrophages, also referred to as large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs), play an important role as gatekeepers of peritoneal homeostasis by providing a first line of defense against pathogenic threats. About a third of the LPMs express the surface receptor V-set and Immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4), but it is unclear to what extent these cells differ from their VSIG4-negative counterparts and perform dedicated functions. Here, we demonstrate that VSIG4+ LPMs, in contrast to VSIG4- LPMs, are in majority derived from embryonal precursors and their occurrence is to a large extent independent from sex and microbiota. Although their transcriptome and surface proteome are indistinguishable from VSIG4- LPMs at steady-state, VSIG4+ LPMs are superior in phagocytosing Gram-positive bacteria and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. In-house generated anti-VSIG4 nanobody constructs that are antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enabled allowed a selective elimination of the VSIG4+ LPM subset without affecting the overall LPM content of the peritoneal cavity. This strategy uncovered a role for VSIG4+ LPMs in lowering the first peak of parasitemia in a Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection model and in reducing the outgrowth of CRC cells in the peritoneal cavity, a prime metastatic site in CRC patients. Altogether, our data uncover a protective role for VSIG4+ LPMs in infectious and oncological diseases in the peritoneal cavity.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, particularly in combating viral infections and malignancies. CD8 T cells, derived from bone marrow progenitors and matured in the thymus, play an essential role in immune defense through their cytotoxic activity. These cells are distinguished by their ability to recognize and eliminate cells that present specific antigens via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Upon activation by antigen recognition, they proliferate and differentiate into effector cells capable of eliminating infected or abnormal cells.CD8+ T cells develop in the thymus and express the CD8 co-receptor, which interacts specifically with MHC class I molecules. When a naïve CD8+ T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC) displaying an antigen bound to MHC class I, it undergoes activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells. The primary function of these cells is to eliminate infected or malignant cells by inducing apoptosis through the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes or by engaging death receptors on target cells. Over the past few decades, CD8+ T cells have garnered significant attention for their potential in immunotherapy, particularly in cancer treatment. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of CD8+ T cells in immunotherapy, their mechanisms of action, and the challenges associated with harnessing their full potential.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Rich cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in cancerous tissues is associated with better clinical prognosis. A major obstacle to tumor T cell infiltration can be the scarcity of adhesion molecules expressed by the growing tumor neo-vasculature that limits the binding and extravasation of effector lymphocytes. In the present study, we aimed at reversing this endothelial cell anergy in vitro by using bispecific antibodies that redirect T cells to endothelial cell growth factor receptors and mediate T cell activation via CD3 and costimulation via CD28 in direct contact with endothelial cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of T cells and endothelial cells resulted in a profound upregulation of adhesion molecules due to the secretion of proinflammatory T cell cytokines. T-cell adhesion to previously quiescent endothelial cells, as well as their capacity to migrate through an endothelial cell monolayer and subsequently kill breast cancer cell spheroids, was greatly augmented.">

        <tr id="The mRNA-binding protein KSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is known to modulate immune cell functions post-transcriptionally, e.g., by reducing the mRNA stability of cytokines. It is known that KSRP binds the AU-rich motifs (ARE) that are often located in the 3′-untranslated part of mRNA species, encoding dynamically regulated proteins as, for example, cytokines. Innate myeloid immune cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages (MACs), eliminate pathogens by multiple mechanisms, including phagocytosis and the secretion of chemo- and cytokines. Here, we investigated the role of KSRP in the phenotype and functions of both innate immune cell types in the mouse model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Here, KSRP−/− mice showed lower levels of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia (AFC) and an increase in the frequencies of PMNs and MACs in the lungs. Our results showed that PMNs and MACs from KSRP−/− mice exhibited an enhanced phagocytic uptake of AFC, accompanied by increased ROS production in PMNs upon stimulation. A comparison of RNA sequencing data revealed that 64 genes related to inflammatory and immune responses were shared between PMNs and MACs. The majority of genes upregulated in PMNs were involved in metabolic processes, cell cycles, and DNA repair. Similarly, KSRP-deficient PMNs displayed reduced levels of apoptosis. In conclusion, our results indicate that KSRP serves as a critical negative regulator of PMN and MAC anti-pathogen activity.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are specialized lymphocytes that help protect against viruses and cancer. However, in the context of bacterial infections, NK cells can be harmful, rather than protective. Such immune pathogenesis by NK cells has been linked to the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In this context, IFN-γ-deficient mice display increased survival rates in response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which causes life-threatening, invasive systemic infections with high mortality rates in humans. However, little is known about how NK cells respond to S. aureus in humans. In this study, we found that the peripheral blood of patients with bloodstream S. aureus infection was enriched for NKG2A+ NK cells with greater cytokine producing capacity, compared to those hospitalized with Escherichia coli bloodstream infections. As a possible mechanistic cause, superantigens from S. aureus promoted the expansion of CD57− NKG2A+ NK cells which produced IFN-γ through an IL-12-independent mechanism and exhibited reduced levels of CD16 compared to unstimulated NK cells. These data suggest that S. aureus bloodstream infection in humans promotes a phenotypic shift towards NKG2A+ NK cells with greater IFN-γ producing capacity, providing a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis. AUTHOR SUMMARY Natural Killer (NK) cells are specialized immune cells that provide crucial defence against viruses but can also respond to bacterial infections, especially in humans. During bloodstream infection by Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans, NK cells may actually be harmful, rather than protective, to the host. However, very little is known about the NK cell response to invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections in humans. Here, we show that human patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli, infections have an increased frequency of NK cells with increased pro-inflammatory capacity. Furthermore, we show that toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which help the bacteria evade the protective effects of T cells the immune system (“superantigens”), promoted the expansion of these pro-inflammatory NK cells, providing a possible mechanistic cause for their increased presence in patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus infections. Collectively, these results suggest that Staphylococcus aureus infection triggers phenotypic and functional changes in NK cells that provide a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis">

 Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC), a severe and potentially life-threatening manifestation of ulcerative colitis (UC) affects up to 25% of patients over their lifetime and requires urgent medical intervention. T cell subsets and myeloid cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation. In this study, we aimed to perform an unbiased analysis of mucosal immune cell populations in patients with ASUC and to identify ASUC-specific cell type alterations.



 Ten adult ASUC patients (defined by the Truelove and Witts criteria), 7 patients with active UC (not fulfilling ASUC criteria), and 5 normal volunteers (NV) were recruited (Fig. 1A). Intestinal mononuclear cells were isolated from endoscopically obtained intestinal biopsies and analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Linear mixed-effects models were applied to compare lineage-normalized cell type fractions across groups, while adjusting for relevant covariates including age, sex, and body mass index.



 Unsupervised clustering of 127,795 cells, expressing 38,224 unique genes, identified 45 distinct cell types (Fig. 1B). Among the salient findings specific to lymphoid cells, re-clustering of the T cell/NK cell compartment identified 9 cell subsets (Fig. 1C-D). Notably, TH17 cells (RORA, CTSH, CXCR6, and CCL20) and cycling TH17 cells (MKI67, PCLAF, SMC4, NUSAP1, and RRM2) were significantly enriched in patients with ASUC compared to those with active UC (adjusted P=0.019 and P=0.027, respectively) and NV (adjusted P<0.001 for both) (Fig. 1E-F). Among myeloid cells, of the 11 delineated subsets, patients with ASUC showed a significant reduction in lineage-normalized fractions of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) (CD1C, FCER1A) relative to both active UC and NV (adjusted P=0.017 for both) (Fig. 1G). Additionally, a cluster of CD14+ monocytes (CD14, FCN1, and LYZ) was significantly elevated in patients with ASUC compared to NV (adjusted P=0.032).



 Elevated TH17 cell frequencies distinguish ASUC from UC. While further investigations, including protein-level validation of transcriptomic data and an assessment of the impact of cellular perturbation on treatment outcome, are ongoing, these findings shed light on a potentially underappreciated role for TH17-polarized T cells in ASUC.

 PD-1 co-inhibitory receptor agonists, such as rosnilimab, are a promising class of therapeutics that leverage immune homeostatic mechanisms to regulate T cell activity for treatment of inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis (UC). In UC lamina propria, multiple T cell subtypes express PD-1, including peripheral helper T cells (Tph) and effector memory T cells, and the reduction of PD-1+ Tph cells is correlated with remission.1 Also, PD-1+ Tregs may comprise a subpopulation of pro-inflammatory Tregs in the UC colon. In a mouse model of colitis (induced by transfer of CD4+CD45Rb+ T cells from human PD-1 transgenic mice), rosnilimab treatment of established disease showed reduced body weight loss, reduced inflammation of the colon, and reduced infiltration of CD4 T cells.2



 A secondary analysis of active UC patient-derived colonic tissue characterized PD-1+ T cell subsets via a CD3-sorted single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics dataset.3 Pathway activity was estimated using Progeny.4 Bulk RNA-sequencing, gene expression analysis, and enrichment of human UC significant Reactome5 pathways was performed on colonic tissue from mice treated with rosnilimab in the colitis model.



 In human UC colonic tissue, PD-1+ CD4 conventional T (Tcon) cells and PD-1+ Tregs had increased JAK-STAT, TNF, and NF-κB estimated pathway activity compared to PD-1(-) cells. PD-1+ Tregs had increased expression of genes associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype, including TNF, TBX21(TBET), and IL12RB2, and decreased expression of IL2RA (CD25). RNA-Seq of mouse colitis identified upregulated genes, compared to naive animals, in pathways that were also involved in human UC (“Signaling by interleukins” (e.g., Il6) and “Chemokine receptors bind chemokines” (e.g., Ccl20)). Expression levels of these genes in rosnilimab treated mice were similar to naive control animals. Additionally, the barrier gene Muc3 and fibrosis-associated Mmp9 were dysregulated in colitis but normal in rosnilimab-treated mice.



 In UC colonic tissue, PD-1+ CD4 Tcon cells demonstrated increased inflammatory gene expression and PD-1+ Tregs exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, suggesting that targeting both PD-1+ CD4 Tcon and PD-1+ Tregs may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of rosnilimab in UC. These additional analyses support preclinical findings and suggest beneficial modulation of gene expression pathways of human UC, including reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis, and upregulation of barrier function genes. These data demonstrate that PD-1 is upstream of multiple clinically validated drivers of UC and support the scientific rationale for studying rosnilimab in an ongoing Phase 2 study in UC (NCT06127043).

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells, as critical components of the innate immune system, have emerged as promising candidates in cancer therapy due to their ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells without prior sensitization. Their mechanisms of action, including perforin-granzyme release and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), position them as versatile agents in cancer immunotherapy. Recent advancements, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells and cytokine-based stimulation, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects compared to conventional immunotherapies. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a significant obstacle, imposing challenges like immune checkpoint activation, cytokine suppression, and metabolic constraints that impair NK cell activity. This paper explores the therapeutic potential of NK cells, the challenges of immune resistance in the TME, and emerging strategies to enhance NK cell efficacy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for optimizing NK cell-based treatments and achieving durable responses in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids. SUMMARY The neurotropic Usutu virus can cause encephalitis driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, microglia activation and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which are inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal for initiating adaptive immunity, a process triggered by the activation of DC via pathogen products or damage. Here, we describe an additional layer to this process, essential when pathogen-derived signals alone cannot directly achieve full DC activation. Immunisation with sporozoites from Plasmodium leads to CD8 T cell priming in a complex response that is initiated by a collaboration between conventional type 1 DC (cDC1) and ψδ T cells. We unveil a pivotal initiating role for Vψ1+ ψδ T cells, as they directly supply IL-4 to DC and CD8 T cells. IL-4 synergises with a CD4 T cell-derived CD40L signal to induce IL-12 production by cDC1. Both IL-12 and IL-4 then directly signal CD8 T cells, with synergy between these cytokines driving enhanced IL-12 receptor expression and expansion of responding CD8 T cells. This study reveals a key role for Vψl+ ψδ T cells in initiating CD8 T cell immunity to Plasmodium. More broadly, it shows that responses to some pathogens require help from innate-like T cells to pass an initiation threshold and further amplify the response in a process underscored by IL-4 production.">

For the first time, we generated abundant iNKP cells via an organoid culture system. The iNKP cells, engineered to express CXCR4 and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), efficiently migrated to the bone marrow and generated CAR-iNK cells persisting in peripheral blood (PB) for over 80 days. Notably, CAR-iNKP cell therapy durably protected animals from tumour occurrence. Furthermore, a single low-dose infusion of CAR-iNKP cells following conventional chemotherapy eradicated minimal residual disease (MRD), leading to long-term complete remission.

 Failure to respond to the anti-α4β7 integrin therapy, vedolizumab, is observed in a subset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, potentially linked to distinct T cell activation profiles. This study aims to characterize the transcriptional and phenotypic features of circulating memory CD4⁺ T cells in vedolizumab non-responders and their association with treatment resistance.



 We performed multidimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze IBD patients' circulating memory CD4⁺ T cell compartment, comparing pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood samples from vedolizumab responders and non-responders. Proteogenomic analysis and TCR repertoire profiling of CD4⁺ T cells were conducted using matched peripheral blood samples. Flow cytometry characterized T cell subsets based on surface markers, migration receptors, transcription factors, and cytokine expression, focusing on differences in activation and migration profiles.



 Ki67⁺ cells were enriched in the memory CD4⁺ T cell population of vedolizumab non-responders in both UC and CD, confirmed by two independent cohorts. TCR repertoire analysis showed increased diversity in memory CD4⁺ T cells post-treatment. Single-cell sequencing and proteomics revealed these Ki67⁺ cells had a high activation and proliferation profile (HLA-DR, CD40LG, MKI67) with reduced IL7R and SELL expression. They displayed elevated integrins (α4, β1, β7) and gut-homing receptors (CXCR3, CCR6). Upregulated T-bet, EOMES, and RORγt and increased IL-17A, indicated a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotype in non-responders.



 Ki67⁺ memory CD4⁺ T cells are significantly enriched in the peripheral blood of vedolizumab non-responders, displaying a distinct transcriptional and phenotypic profile characterized by Th1/Th17 polarization, high integrin α4β1 expression, and enhanced gut-homing capacity. These findings indicate that proliferating effector memory CD4⁺ T cells could contribute to therapy resistance in IBD, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic strategies targeting these cells in anti-α4β7 integrin therapy non-responders.

        <tr id="Chronic rejection (CR) after organ transplantation is alloimmune injury manifested by graft vascular remodeling and fibrosis that is resistant to immunosuppression. Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of MHC class II–mismatched (MHCII-mismatched) heart transplants developing chronic rejection identified graft IL-33 as a stimulator of tissue repair pathways in infiltrating macrophages and Tregs. Using IL-33–deficient donor mice, we show that graft fibroblast–derived IL-33 potently induced amphiregulin (Areg) expression by recipient Tregs. The assessment of clinical samples also confirmed increased expression of Areg by intragraft Tregs also during rejection. Areg is an EGF secreted by multiple immune cells to shape immunomodulation and tissue repair. In particular, Areg is proposed to play a major role in Treg-mediated muscle, epithelium, and nerve repair. Assessment of recipient mice with Treg-specific deletion of Areg surprisingly uncovered that Treg secretion of Areg contributed to CR. Specifically, heart transplants from recipients with Areg-deficient Tregs showed less fibrosis, vasculopathy, and vessel-associated fibrotic niches populated by recipient T cells. Mechanistically, we show that Treg-secreted Areg functioned to increase fibroblast proliferation. In total, these studies identify how a dysregulated repair response involving interactions between IL-33+ fibroblasts in the allograft and recipient Tregs contributed to the progression of CR.">

        <tr id="Tumors can exert a far-reaching influence on the body, triggering systemic responses that contribute to debilitating conditions like cancer cachexia. To characterize the mechanisms underlying tumor-host interactions, we utilized a BioID-based proximity labeling method to identify proteins secreted by Ykiact adult Drosophila gut tumors into the bloodstream/hemolymph. Among the major proteins identified are coagulation and immune-responsive factors that contribute to the systemic wasting phenotypes associated with Ykiact tumors. The effect of innate immunity factors is mediated by NFκB transcription factors Relish, dorsal, and Dif, which in turn upregulate the expression of the cachectic factors Pvf1, Impl2, and Upd3. In addition, Ykiact tumors secrete Eiger, a TNF-alpha homolog, which activates the JNK signaling pathway in neighboring non-tumor cells, leading to cell death. The release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from these dying cells presumably amplifies the inflammatory response, exacerbating systemic wasting. Targeting the inflammatory response, the JNK pathway, or the production of cachectic factors could potentially alleviate the debilitating effects of cancer cachexia.">

This study aimed to investigate the effects of IFN-γ and a cytokine mix (5MIX: IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, OsM, and TNF-α) on the antigen-presenting capabilities of keratinocytes, with a specific focus on immune-mediated dermatological conditions such as psoriasis (Ps). To achieve this, keratinocytes were treated with IFN-γ and 5MIX, and their impact on the expression of key antigen-presentation molecules, HLA-DRα and CD74, was assessed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IFN-γ alone altered the expression of 254 genes, highlighting its central role in modulating immune responses, including the recruitment of immune cells and regulation of inflammation. Temporal experiments further demonstrated that IFN-γ and 5MIX enhanced early endocytic activity and lysosomal degradation pathways, both essential for effective antigen presentation and T-cell activation. To extend these findings to a clinical context, a co-culture model using keratinocytes derived from psoriatic patients was established. This model revealed increased cytokine production following antigen stimulation, indicating robust and consistent CD4+ and naïve T-cell responses. These results elucidate the complex dynamics of cytokine signaling and antigen presentation in keratinocytes, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated skin disorders like Ps.">

        <tr id="Introduction T-lymphopenia (TLP) is a frequently observed condition in cancer patients, often exacerbated by conventional chemo/radiotherapy, which impairs the efficacy of subsequent immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. This study aimed to understand the impact of TLP on ICB responsiveness and explore potential therapeutic strategies to enhance antitumor immunity. Methods To investigate ICB responsiveness depending on the severity of TLP, first, we established TLP mouse models that mimic clinically observed mild and severe TLP through thymectomy and anti-Thy1-induced peripheral T cell depletion. T cell-replete mice and T-lymphopenic mice were inoculated with palpable or advanced tumors to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy according to the severity of TLP. Additionally, by utilizing established murine models, we analyzed matched blood, tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and tumor samples by flow cytometry to investigate the mechanisms by which ICB responsiveness is impaired under T-lymphopenic conditions. Finally, to evaluate the combination effect of anti-PD-1 and recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc) in T-lymphopenic conditions, we administered anti-PD-1, rhIL-7-hyFc, or both to advanced tumor-bearing T-lymphopenic mice and subsequently analyzed tumor growth and survival rates. Results Using mouse models mimicking clinical TLP, we observed that the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy was severely impaired in TLP, depending on the degree of TLP and the immunogenicity of the tumors. TLP mice showed a significant reduction in systemic CD8 T cells but stable intratumoral CD8 T cell numbers, suggesting maintained tumor infiltration despite systemic downregulation. Crucially, TLP led to a shift in the composition of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with a decrease in PD-1+ tumor-reactive CD8 T cells and an increase in PD-1− bystander cells. This reduction in PD-1+ cells was linked to impaired clonal expansion in tumor-draining lymph nodes. To counteract these effects, we introduced recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc), which effectively restored systemic T cell counts, enhanced PD-1+ CD8 T cell proliferation within tumors, and increased the population of stem-like progenitor cells. The combination of rhIL-7-hyFc and anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in significant tumor regression and improved mouse survival. Discussion Our findings highlight the critical role of IL-7 in reshaping the CD8 T cell landscape to improve ICB efficacy in TLP conditions, proposing a sequential therapeutic approach: conventional therapy to reduce tumor burden and enhance immunogenicity, followed by IL-7 therapy to restore and rejuvenate CD8 T cells, culminating in effective ICB treatment.">

 ACOD1 is the ubiquitous source of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate. We hypothesised monocyte ACOD1 expression is an inhibitory pathway that limits intestinal inflammation.



 We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of colonoscopic biopsies from >120 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and healthy controls, with complementary analysis of DSS treated C57BL/6J (WT) mice, validated using flow cytometry in independent cohorts. Acod1–/– mice received 2% DSS in acute and recovery models, complemented by competitive bone marrow chimeric mice, anti-IFN / itaconate-derivate treatment and transgenic cell depletion models.



 We profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of intestinal CXCL9/10+ cells that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs).
 These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate specific expression of IBD susceptibility genes, including NOD2. By performing cross-species analysis in mice, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete MDP-precursor in the bone marrow and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans.
 Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production.



 Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health. Reduced itaconate production from IAMs in CD may predispose to chronic inflammation and disease progression.

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disease characterized by the dysregulation of multiple factors, including host immunity. The intestinal activation of T cells showing cytotoxic activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production is one of the key factors in its pathology. Therefore, targeting pro-inflammatory leukocytes from the circulation and in the inflammatory site is a reasonable therapeutic goal. CCR9 is the main activator of gut-tropism in the lymphocytes and responsible for the activation of migratory responses in lymphocytes into the lamina propria.
 SBR1 is a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR9 mAb showing high-affinity and specific binding towards CCR9+ cells. Displaying effector functions such as Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP), SRB1 shows specific depletion of infiltrating and circulating CCR9+ cells in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patient samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.



 Matching blood and 5 mm gut explants were obtained from IBD patients, then they were cultured for 16h with SRB1 and subsequently, CCR9+ cells were characterized by flow cytometry. The culture supernatants from these explants as well as blood samples from the same patients were analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokine production by Multiplex cytokine immune assay. Finally, in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) CCR9 cell depletion was determined by flow cytometric assays at doses of 8, 15 y 25 mg/kg.



 We showed that CCR9 is highly expressed in intestine samples from IBD patients, especially in T cells, but also in other cell types including dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Treatment with SRB1 was able to effectively deplete CCR9+ cells, specifically T CD4+ CCR9+ and CCR9+ memory T cells from blood and intestinal samples from IBD patients. This depletion also reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the culture media. Finally, SRB1 also showed efficacy depleting CCR9 in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) at different doses without showing any secondary adverse effects. All these data suggest a potential therapeutic potential of the antibody in the pathogenesis of IBD patients.



 SRB1 delivers potent blood and tissue depletion of CCR9 expressing cells ex vivo and in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patients’ samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SRB1 (anti-CCR9 mAb) a novel therapeutic approach for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases including CD and UC.

However, NK cells fail to restrain the growth of malignancies, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The molecular genetics of NK cells in the B-ALL bone marrow microenvironment and the mechanisms underlying the inhibited function of NK cells at the single-cell level remain largely elusive.In this study, we studied the frequency and absolute number of NK cells in peripheral blood samples collected from 43 healthy volunteers and 104 pediatric B-ALL patients diagnosed at Hunan Children’s Hospital. We also analyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from B-ALL and normal bone marrow samples using unsupervised clustering. Our findings were further validated using bulk transcriptomic data and clinical data from a cohort of 139 B-ALL bone marrow samples.We found that the frequency and number of NK cells were significantly decreased in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of B-ALL patients. In-depth analysis of scRNAseq data identified 12 NK cell clusters. Among them, the C2 cluster, which is present in healthy bone marrow but reduced in B-ALL bone marrow, displays overexpression of a transcription factor KLF2 and a significant downregulation of the “leukocyte proliferation” pathway. Furthermore, we found that the expression of KLF2 in B-ALL at diagnosis was positively correlated with the percentage of leukemia cells and the positive rate of minimal residual disease (MRD), indicating that KLF2 is a marker of poor prognosis.There are dramatic differences at the single-cell level in the transcriptomics of NK cells between healthy donors and B-ALL patients. A transcription factor, KLF2, which is enriched in the C2 cluster of NK cells, has been suggested to regulate the proliferation of NK cells and is associated with poor prognosis of pediatric B-ALL.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell-intrinsic signaling pathways can drastically affect the tumor immune microenvironment, promoting tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy by excluding immune-cell populations from the tumor. Several tumor cell-intrinsic pathways have been reported to modulate myeloid-cell and T-cell infiltration creating "cold" tumors. However, clinical evidence suggests that excluding cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core also mediates immune evasion. Here, we find that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 signaling in non-small cell lung cancer induces the exclusion of cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core and promotes resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. Mechanistically, tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression upregulates CCL2 in tumor cells, resulting in increased recruitment of regulatory T cells. CD8+ T-cell exclusion depended on regulatory T cell-mediated suppression of tumor vasculature. Depleting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells via Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related protein (GITR) restored CD8+ T-cell infiltration and, when combined with checkpoint blockade therapy, reduced tumor growth. These results show that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression in lung cancer serves as a mechanism of immunotherapy resistance and provide evidence to support future studies investigating whether NSCLC patients with SOX2-dependent CD8+ T-cell exclusion would benefit from the depletion of GITR+ Tregs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma patients reside in the bone marrow and continuously interact with local immune cells. Progression and therapy response are influenced by this immune environment, highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of endogenous immune responses to malignant plasma cells. Here we used the 5TGM1 murine transfer model of multiple myeloma to dissect early immune responses to myeloma cells. We modeled stable and progressive disease by transferring 5TGM1 murine myeloma cells into C57Bl/6 mice and KaLwRij mice, respectively. We used flow cytometry and single‐cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses to characterize differential immune responses in stable and progressive disease. Transfer of 5TGM1 cells in C57Bl/6 mice led to stable disease with low tumor burden in a subset of animals. Stable disease was associated with sustained activation and expansion of NK cells, ILC1, and CD8+ T cells, a response that was lost upon disease progression. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing of immune cells and bulk RNA sequencing of immune and mesenchymal stromal cells implicated the activation of interferon responses as a central immune pathway during stable disease. Experimentally, neutralization of IFNγ significantly increased myeloma development and progression in C57Bl/6 mice, testifying to the importance of this pathway in early disease control. In conclusion, we provide a framework for studying immune responses to multiple myeloma progression in immunocompetent and genetically modifiable mice and highlight the importance of bone marrow immunity in tumor control.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by unlimited accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides. It is often accompanied by disease, and the relationship between ferroptosis of immune cells and immune regulation has been attracting increasing attention. Initially, it was found in cancer research that the inhibition of regulatory T cell (Treg) ferroptosis and the promotion of CD8+ T cell ferroptosis jointly promoted the formation of an immune-tolerant environment in tumors. T-cell ferroptosis has subsequently been found to have immunoregulatory effects in other diseases. As an autoimmune disease characterized by immune imbalance, T-cell ferroptosis has attracted attention for its potential in regulating immune balance in lupus nephritis. This article reviews the metabolic processes within different T-cell subsets in lupus nephritis (LN), including T follicular helper (TFH) cells, T helper (Th)17 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Treg cells, and reveals that these cellular metabolisms not only facilitate the formation of a T-cell immune imbalance but are also closely associated with the occurrence of ferroptosis. Consequently, we hypothesize that targeting the metabolic pathways of ferroptosis could become a novel research direction for effectively treating the immune imbalance in lupus nephritis by altering T-cell differentiation and the incidence of ferroptosis.">

        <tr id="Bryostatin-1, a potent agonist of the protein kinase C, has been studied for HIV and cancer therapies. In HIV research, it has shown anti-HIV effects during acute infection and reactivation of latent HIV in chronic infection. As effective CD8+ T cell responses are essential for eliminating reactivated virus and achieving a cure, it is important to investigate how bryostatin-1 affects HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. HIV-specific CD8+ T cells often become exhausted, showing reduced proliferative potential and impaired cytokine production, a dysfunction also observed in cancer. Therefore, we further investigated how bryostatin-1 directly impacts exhausted CD8+ T cells.PBMCs from people with HIV (PWH) were treated with bryostatin-1 and tracked with proliferation dye for cell expansion. One day 6, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected by tetramers staining and examined by flow cytometry. By utilizing an established in vitro murine T cell exhaustion system, changes in inhibitory receptors, transcription factors, cytokine production and killing capacity of bryostatin-1 treated exhausted CD8+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry. RNA-seq analysis was performed to study transcriptional changes in these cells.We found that bryostatin-1 improved the expansion and decreased PD-1 expression of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 enhanced the functionality and proliferation while decreasing inhibitory receptor expression of in vitro generated exhausted CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 upregulated TCF-1 and decreased TOX expression. These changes were confirmed through RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 11 was significantly downregulated in exhausted CD8+ T cells, however, it greatly upregulated after bryostatin-1 treatment. Inhibition of MAPK11 in bryostatin-1-treated cells blocked the increased proliferation and IFN-γ production induced by bryostatin-1, but did not affect other bryostatin-1 induced effects, such as the reduction of inhibitory receptors.Our data demonstrate that bryostatin-1 induces a MAPK 11-dependent improvement in the proliferative and functional capacity of exhausted T cells. This study provides a rationale for bryostatin-1's potential to help eradicate the HIV reservoir during treatment, and it may also contribute to cancer immunotherapy by functionally improving exhausted CD8+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Background Although MDSCs are widely recognized for their immunoinhibitory effects in pathological conditions, their function during HIV infection particularly within the mechanisms underlying incomplete immune recovery remains elusive. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 30 healthy controls and 62 HIV-1-infected subjects [31 immunological non-responders (INRs) and 31 immunological responders (IRs)] were selected. The proportion of MDSCs was determined in each category of participants. Using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, immune regulatory molecules (including PD-L1, ARG1, iNOS, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO) that are relevant for MDSCs activity were quantified. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the blockade of PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways on MDSCs and their effects on CD4+ T-cells using in vitro functional experiments. Results PMN-MDSCs are more abundant and are negatively correlated to CD4 counts in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, PMN-MDSCs suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in INRs. Furthermore, correlations were found between PD-L1 expression on PMN-MDSCs and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells. TGF-β expression on PMN-MDSCs was likewise enhanced in INRs. Importantly, inhibiting both PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways had a synergistic impact on restoring CD4+ T-cell activity in vitro. Conclusions PMN-MDSCs expansion inhibits CD4+ T-cell responses. We suggest that targeting PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways together may significantly improve immune recovery in INRs.">

Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T-cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients.

        <tr id="Abstract In recent years, with an increasingly profound comprehension of the tumor microenvironment, it has been discovered that the constituent cells within the immune microenvironment, such as macrophages, CD4+T cells, and CD8+T cells, interact with tumor cells in manners conducive to tumorigenesis and progression. Exosomes play a pivotal role as essential mediators for intercellular material exchange and signal transmission in this context. Tumor cell-derived exosomes carrying cargo such as PD-L1 and ncRNAs engage with CD8+T cells to induce cytotoxic responses and facilitate immune evasion, thereby promoting tumor advancement. When combined with current immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-L1/PD-1 therapy, enhancing CD8+T cell function through exosomal pathways while monitoring and augmenting therapeutic effects can significantly improve efficacy. This review delineates the crucial role of exosomes derived from both tumor cells and CD8+T cells within the tumor microenvironment along with their impact mechanisms on both tumor cells and CD8+T cells. Furthermore, it summarizes the potential for clinical treatment in this realm when integrated with existing immunotherapy methods—particularly exploring the feasibility of clinical translation alongside engineering materials science techniques.">

Not only does tolerance mitigate collateral damage from host immune responses, but in doing so permits a robust response sufficient to clear infection as necessary. Yet, despite occupying such a cornerstone, research aiming to unravel the intricacies of tolerance induction is mired by interchangeable and often misused terminologies, with markers and mechanistic pathways that beg the question of redundancy. In this review we aim to define these boarders by providing new perspectives to long-standing theories of tolerance. Given the central role of T cells in enforcing immune cascades, in this review we choose to explore immunological tolerance through the perspective of T cell ‘resistance to activation,’ to delineate the contexts in which one tolerance mechanism has evolved over the other. By clarifying the important biological markers and cellular players underpinning T cell resistance to activation, we aim to encourage more purposeful and directed research into tolerance and, more-over, potential therapeutic strategies in autoimmune diseases and cancer.

        <tr id="Dendritic Cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in the immune system, acting as sentinels that capture, process and present antigens to T cells, thus initiating and regulating immune responses. Activation of DCs stands at the forefront as they work as coordinators of the immune system, spotting and presenting microbe fragments to T cells, thereby commencing Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI). This review aims to trace the origin of DCs and find out what makes them stand out among other antigen-presenting cells. The research takes us into the DC mechanisms of activation that affect T-cell proliferation, especially in cancer pathologies. Participants are also outlined the possible effects of DC study related to the oncological treatments’ development. Briefly, discrimination based on the complex participation of DCs and T cells should pave the way for more potential interventions for improving immunotherapy and other diseases. In summary, dendritic cells are central players in orchestrating immune responses, including those against cancer cells. Understanding their biology and interactions with cancer cells is crucial for developing effective immunotherapies for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVES
To investigate the pro-phagocytic phenotype of macrophages in SSc and other rheumatic diseases by examining their activation, signaling pathways, and treatment responses, with the goal of uncovering mechanisms that drive enhanced phagocytosis.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (GSE138669/GSE212109) from skin and lung macrophages of healthy controls and SSc patients were analyzed. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) were differentiated from CD14+ monocytes from healthy controls, SSc, RA, PsA, and axSpA patients. In selected experiments, hMDMs were pretreated with 0.1 μM nintedanib. Phagocytic activity was quantified using pHrodo bioparticles and flow cytometry. Macrophage surface markers were evaluated by flow cytometry, NF-κB signaling by Western blot, and gene expression by RT-qPCR.


RESULTS
Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets revealed a pro-phagocytic signature in SSc-affected organs. SSc macrophages, particularly the FCGR3A  hi cluster in skin, exhibited elevated expression of FCGR genes and enriched FcγR-mediated phagocytosis pathways, accompanied by pro-inflammatory markers. This phenotype extended to FCN1  hi lung macrophages in SSc patients with interstitial lung disease, indicating a systemic pro-inflammatory and phagocytic profile. hMDMs from SSc, RA, and PsA patients demonstrated enhanced phagocytic activity in vitro. Elevated FcγRI and FcγRII levels were identified as key drivers of increased phagocytic activity and subsequent IL-6-driven inflammation. Nintedanib showed reduction in FcγRI expression, suggesting its potential therapeutic benefit in attenuating the phagocytic process.


CONCLUSION
This study highlights FcγR-expressing macrophages as drivers of phagocytosis and inflammatory responses in SSc. Dysregulated activation of these macrophages could lead to persistent inflammation and fibrosis in rheumatic diseases, highlighting new potential therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is characterized by a concomitant early pro-inflammatory response by immune cells to an infection, and an opposing anti-inflammatory response that results in protracted immunosuppression. The primary pathological event in sepsis is widespread programmed cell death, or cellular self-sacrifice, of innate and adaptive immune cells, leading to profound immunological suppression. This severe immune dysfunction hampers effective primary pathogen clearance, thereby increasing the risk of secondary opportunistic infections, latent viral reactivation, multiple organ dysfunction, and elevated mortality. The types of cell death include apoptosis (type I programmed cell death), autophagy (type II programmed cell death), NETosis (a program for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)) and other programmed cell deaths like pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, each contributing to immunosuppression in distinct ways during the later phases of sepsis. Extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, such as CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, is strongly associated with immunosuppression. Apoptosis of dendritic cells further compromises T and B cell survival and can induce T cell anergy or promote regulatory Treg cell proliferation. Moreover, delayed apoptosis and impaired neutrophil function contribute to nosocomial infections and immune dysfunction in sepsis. Interestingly, aberrant NETosis and the subsequent depletion of mature neutrophils also trigger immunosuppression, and neutrophil pyroptosis can positively regulate NETosis. The interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) plays a key role in T cell modulation and neutrophil apoptosis in sepsis. The dendritic cell growth factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLTEL), increases DC numbers, enhances CD 28 expression, attenuates PD-L1, and improves survival in sepsis. Recently, immunoadjuvant therapies have attracted attention for their potential to restore host physiological immunity and homeostasis in patients with sepsis. This review focuses on several potential immunotherapeutic agents designed to bolster suppressed innate and adaptive immune responses in the management of sepsis.">

        <tr id="Immune recognition and activation by the peptide-laden major histocompatibility complex–T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex is essential for anti-tumor immunity. Tumors may escape immune surveillance by dissembling the complex. Here, we report that transferrin, which is overexpressed in patients with liver metastasis, disassociates TCR from the CD3 signaling apparatus by targeting the constant domain (CD) of T cell receptor α (TCRα), consequently suppresses T cell activation, and inhibits anti-metastatic and anti-tumor immunity. In mouse models of melanoma and lymphoma, transferrin overexpression exacerbates liver metastasis, while its knockdown, antibody, designed peptides, and CD mutation interfering with transferrin–TCRα interaction inhibit metastasis. This work reveals a novel strategy of tumor evasion of immune surveillance by blocking the coupling between TCRs and the CD3 signaling apparatus to suppress TCR activation. Given the conservation of CD and transferrin up-regulation in metastatic tumors, the strategy might be a common metastatic mechanism. Targeting transferrin–TCRα holds promise for anti-metastatic treatment.">

        <tr id="Although significant progress has been made in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, its overall efficacy remains limited in a large number of patients. The interaction between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and CD8+ T cells is one of the core topics in cancer immunotherapy research. CD8+ T cells can play an anti-tumor role by recognizing and killing virus-infected or mutated cells. However, in the TME, as the tumor compresses immune cells, the function of them is impaired, and studies have found that relying on PD-1 alone is not enough to resist tumor cells. Therefore, by blocking the PD-1 and Tim-3 pathways to interfere with CD8+ T cell exhaustion (TEX), the performance of CD8+ T cells can be maximized, their survival period extended, and the efficacy of positive cancer immunotherapy improved. For patients with cancer who have failed to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy, multi-targeted combination therapy may achieve better results.">

        <tr id="Glucocorticoids (GC) are cornerstone drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Because MM cells exploit the bone marrow microenvironment to obtain growth and survival signals, resistance to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis emerges, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify that the chemokine receptor CCR1, together with its main ligand CCL3, plays a pivotal role in reducing the glucocorticoid sensitivity of MM cells. We show that blocking CCR1 signaling with the antagonist BX471 enhances the anti-MM effects of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone in MM cell lines, primary patient material and a myeloma xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, the drug combination shifts the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins towards apoptosis and deregulates lysosomal proteins. Our findings suggest that CCR1 may play a role in glucocorticoid resistance, as the GC-induced downregulation of CCR1 mRNA and protein is blunted in a GC-resistance onset model. Moreover, we demonstrate that inhibiting CCR1 partially reverses this resistance, providing a promising strategy for resensitizing MM cells to GC treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="There is a high medical need to develop new strategies for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) refractory to conventional therapy. In vitro, the combinations of the blast-modulatory response modifiers GM-CSF + Prostaglandin E1, (summarized as Kit M) have been shown to convert myeloid leukemic blasts into antigen-presenting dendritic cells of leukemic origin (DCleu) that were able to (re-)activate the innate and adaptive immune system, direct it specifically against leukemic blasts, and induce memory cells. This study aimed to investigate the immune modulatory capacity and antileukemic efficacy of Kit M in vivo. Brown Norway rats suffering from AML were treated with Kit M (twofold application). Blasts and immune cells were monitored in peripheral blood (PB) and spleen. Upon the observation of promising immune modulatory effects in the treated animals, two patients with AML refractory to multiple lines of therapy were offered treatment with Kit M on an individualized basis. Safety, as well as immunological and clinical effects, were monitored. Samples obtained from a third patient in similar clinical conditions not receiving Kit M were used as controls for immune monitoring tests. Animal experiments: Drugs were well tolerated by the treated animals. After 9 days of treatment, DCleu and memory-like T cells increased in the peripheral blood, whereas regulatory T cells, especially blasts, decreased in treated as compared to untreated control animals. Clinical courses: No severe side effects were observed. In patient 1482, PB blasts remained under the detection threshold during 27 days of treatment, thrombocytes were normalized, and (leukemia specific) immune effector cells of the adaptive and innate immune system increased up to 800-fold compared to the start of treatment. Patient 1601 responded with a 12% reduction in blasts in PB immediately after Kit M treatment. Several subtypes of (leukemia-specific) immune effector cells in PB increased up to four-fold during the 19 days of treatment. In contrast, immune-reactive cells decreased under mild chemotherapy in the PB of control patient 1511 with comparably refractory AML. Within the limitation of low numbers in both animal experiments and clinical applications, our data suggest that Kit M treatment of AML-diseased rats and patients is feasible and may induce leukemia-specific immune reactions and clinical improvement. A larger series and a prospective clinical trial will be required to confirm our observations. Beyond optimized doses and schedules of the applied compounds, the combination with other antileukemic strategies or the application of Kit M in less proliferative stages of the myeloid diseases need to be discussed. If effects are confirmed, the concept may add to the armamentarium of treatments for highly aggressive blood cancer.">

 Biologic therapies have transformed the lives of people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, however, management of the disease remains challenging for those who have failed all available treatments. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), owing to their hypoimmunogenic and immunomodulatory properties, have shown promise in treating various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. We investigated whether allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) could be used to manage severe, multiple biologic-refractory psoriasis. On compassionate grounds, we treated three women (Patients 1–3), aged 44, 46 and 47 years, respectively, with long-standing plaque psoriasis; on treatment, baseline psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) were 37.6, 13.8 and 22.8; and DLQI 27, 15 and 20, respectively. All patients had failed at least five biologics across all four classes. Allogeneic UC-MSCs were administered intravenously at a dose of 1.5–3 × 106cells/kg on Days 0 and 7, as adjuvant therapy alongside etanercept biosimilar in Patient 1 and monotherapy in Patients 2 and 3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were immunophenotyped using multi-parameter flow cytometry. UC-MSCs were well-tolerated and provided variable, direct clinical benefit in all patients: Patient 2, the best responder, achieved PASI87 at Week (W)4 whereas Patient 1 experienced the most durable, albeit moderate, response with PASI39 at W2, lasting >20 weeks. DLQI also improved post-UC-MSCs, up to 17-point reduction at W2 in Patient 1. Upon psoriasis flare post-UC-MSCs, Patient 1 switched to a new biologic, bimekizumab at W24 whereas Patients 2 and 3 were re-initiated on previously failed biologics – guselkumab and bimekizumab, respectively, at W9. Patients 2 and 3 demonstrated a greatly improved response to previously failed biologics, achieving PASI94 (16.9 to 1) and PASI96 (29.1 to 1.2) from the time of biologic re-initiation respectively, sustained for >12 months. Flow cytometry of PBMCs in individual patients showed overall increased frequencies of CD4+CLA+CD103- skin-homing and CD4+CLA+CD103+ skin-recirculating memory T cells, associated with reductions in PASI. Similar trends occurred for CD8+ counterparts and following re-initiation of previously failed biologics. There was phenotypic switch of peripheral blood monocytes from CD14+CD16+ intermediate to CD14lowCD16+ non-classical, suppressive phenotype post-UC-MSCs. Furthermore, an exponential rise in frequency of CD25highCD127lowFOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) was observed in the most durable responder, i.e. Patient 1. Together, these data highlight the immunomodulatory capacity of UC-MSC therapy in severe multiple biologic-refractory psoriasis, possibly by increasing Tregs frequency, phenotypic switching of monocytes and reducing the migratory capacity of pathogenic T cells to involved skin. Immune changes occurred in parallel to clinical efficacy. It appears that UC-MSCs may reset the immune profile thereby facilitating restoration of response to previously failed biologics.

        <tr id="Oncolytic viruses have emerged as a highly promising modality for cancer treatment due to their ability to replicate specifically within tumors, carry therapeutic genes, and modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through various mechanisms. Additionally, they show potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. A study report indicates that from 2000 to 2020, 49.5% of oncolytic viruses were administered intratumorally and 35% intravenously during clinical trials. However, both administration methods face significant challenges, particularly with intravenous delivery, which encounters issues such as non-specific tissue uptake, neutralizing antibody responses, and antiviral effects mediated by various immune cells. Despite extensive research into the antiviral roles of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in oncolytic virus therapy, neutrophils—constituting approximately 50% to 70% of human peripheral blood leukocytes—have received relatively little attention. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte subset in peripheral circulation, known for their phagocytic activity. Beyond their traditional roles in bacterial and fungal infections, emerging literature suggests that neutrophils also play a critical role in the body’s antiviral responses. Given the gaps in understanding the role of neutrophils in oncolytic virus therapy, this article reviews current literature on this topic. It aims to provide a theoretical foundation for developing oncolytic virus-based cancer therapies and enhancing their anti-tumor efficacy in future clinical treatments.">

        <tr id="Abstract The rise in global life expectancy has led to an increase in the older population, presenting significant challenges in managing infectious diseases. Aging affects the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) and immune function decline (immunosenescence). These changes would impair defense mechanisms, increase susceptibility to infections and reduce vaccine efficacy in older adults. Cellular senescence exacerbates these issues by releasing pro-inflammatory factors, further perpetuating chronic inflammation. Moreover, comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which are common in older adults, amplify immune dysfunction, while immunosuppressive medications further complicate responses to infections. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving inflammaging and immunosenescence, focusing on genomic instability, telomere attrition, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we discussed how aging-associated immune alterations influence responses to bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and evaluated emerging antiaging strategies, aimed at mitigating these effects to improve health outcomes in the aging population.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

        <tr id="Cytokines, which are important to the tumor microenvironment (TME), play critical roles in tumor development, metastasis, and immune responses. Interleukin-17(IL-17) has emerged as a key biomarker in many malignancies; however, its precise involvement in gastric cancer is less fully understood. Elevated levels of IL-17 have been observed in stomach diseases such as Helicobacter pylori infection and autoimmune gastritis, indicating that a sustained Th17 response may precede the development of gastric cancer. While IL-17 is related to inflammatory processes that may lead to cancer, its specific influence on gastric cancer development and therapy needs to be completely understood. Specifically, the release of IL-17A by diverse immune cells has been associated with both tumor development and inhibition in gastric cancer. It may impact tumor development through mechanisms such as boosting cell proliferation, inducing angiogenesis, and enabling immune cell recruitment or, conversely, suppressing tumor growth via the activation of anti-tumor immune responses. The dual role of IL-17 in cancer, along with its various effects depending on the TME and immune cell composition, highlights the complexity of its activity. Current research reveals that although IL-17 might serve as a target for immunotherapy, its therapeutic potential is hindered by its various activities. Some studies have shown that anti-IL-17 drugs may be helpful, especially when paired with immune checkpoint inhibitors, whereas others point to concerns about the validity of IL-17 in gastric cancer therapy. The lack of clinical trials and the heterogeneity of human tumors underscore the necessity for individualized treatment approaches. Further studies are needed to identify the specific mechanisms of IL-17 in gastric cancer and to design targeted therapeutics appropriately.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of many malignant tumors. However, ICI-induced hyper-immune activation causes cardiotoxicity. Traditional treatments such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants have limited effectiveness and may even accelerate tumor growth. This study aimed to identify approaches that effectively reduce cardiotoxicity and simultaneously preserve or enhance the antitumor immunity of ICI therapy. Methods ICI injection in melanoma-bearing C57BL/6J female mice was used to simulate cardiotoxicity in patients with tumor undergoing immune therapy. MCC950 was used to block nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity. Echocardiography, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to assess cardiac function, immune cell populations, and inflammatory factor levels. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing was used to detect the changes in cardiac transcriptome and immunological network. Results NLRP3 inhibition reduced inflammatory response and improved cardiac function. Notably, NLRP3 inhibition also resulted in a pronounced suppression of tumor growth. Single-cell RNA sequencing elucidated that MCC950 treatment reduced the cardiac infiltration of pathogenic macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, activated T cells, and their production of inflammatory cytokines, while enhancing the presence of reparative macrophages and naive T cells. In addition, MCC950 attenuated cardiotoxicity induced by dual programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) immunotherapy and promoted tumor regression, and showed efficacy in treating established cardiotoxicity. Conclusions Our findings provide a promising clinical approach for preventing and treating cardiotoxicity induced by ICIs, dissociating the antitumor efficacy of ICI-based therapies from their cardiotoxic side effects.">

        <tr id="Malaria remains a significant global public health problem. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells, have the capacity to regulate B cells, plasma cells, and antibody production, among other functions. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) possess strong immunosuppressive abilities and can negatively regulate various immune responses. However, the role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh-cell responses during Plasmodium infection remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cell-mediated immune responses upon Plasmodium infection. We found that the numbers of MDSCs increased upon Plasmodium infection. Further mechanism study revealed that MDSC-derived Arg-1 and PD-L1 prevented Tfh cell proliferation and activation. Conversely, the addition of nor-NOHA or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies enhanced the proliferation and activation of Tfh cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cells was dependent on Arg-1 and PD-1/PD-L1. In vivo depletion of MDSCs enhanced Tfh-cell responses and antibody production, as well as relieved symptoms of infected mice and improved their survival rates. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh cell immune responses and further impairing humoral immunity. Our study provides new strategies for malaria prevention and control.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized immune cells that play a crucial role in presenting antigens and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to combat tumors. The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) can bind to its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This interaction suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Radiation therapy can increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, and detailed studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. As many patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy-either through lack of response or cancer recurrence-there is a critical need to maximize synergistic effects by selecting combination treatments that offer improved therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects. In the present study, immature DCs (iDCs) were introduced directly into irradiated tumor sites (referred as IR/iDCs), and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) were administered intraperitoneally. We confirmed the antitumor effect of combining IR/iDCs and ICBs by examining tumor growth and mouse survival. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes increased in the IR/iDCs-treated groups. Combining IR/iDCs with an anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a significant reduction in distant tumor growth and improved mouse survival rates compared with IR/iDCs alone or IR/iDCs + anti-PD-1 antibody. These findings suggest that integrating radiotherapy, DC-based immunotherapy, and ICB, specifically targeting PD-L1, may be an effective cancer treatment strategy.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, a subset of T cells identified by the surface glycoprotein CD8, particularly those expressing the co-stimulatory molecule CD226, play a crucial role in the immune response to malignancies. However, their role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an immunosuppressive disease, has not yet been explored. We studied 64 CLL patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the proportion of CD226-expressing cells among different CD8+ T cell subsets (including naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effectors) in CLL patients, stratified by Rai stage and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutation status. Additionally, we compared the effector functions of CD8+CD226+ cells and their CD226- counterparts. We also quantified cytokine and chemokine levels in the plasma of CLL and HCs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed the publicly available bulk RNA-seq on CD226+ and CD226-CD8+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated the impact of elevated cytokines/chemokines on CD226 expression. Our results showed that CD226-expressing cells were significantly decreased within the effector memory and effector CD8+ T cell subsets in CLL patients with advanced Rai stages and unmutated IgHV, a marker of poor prognosis. These cells displayed robust effector functions, including cytokine production, cytolytic activity, degranulation, proliferation, and migration capacity. In contrast, CD8+CD226- T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype with reduced Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) were inversely correlated with the frequency of CD8+CD226+ T cells and may contribute to the downregulation of CD226, possibly leading to T cell dysfunction in CLL. Our findings highlight the critical role of CD8+CD226+RUNX2hi T cells in CLL and suggest that their reduction is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. This study also underscores the potential of targeting IL-6 and MIP-1β to preserve polyfunctional CD8+CD226+ T cells as a promising immunotherapy strategy.">

However, the impact of anti-PD-1 therapy on host humoral immunity in humans during cancer immunotherapy requires further investigation. Methods We evaluated immunoglobulin titers by ELISA and screened the immune landscape of immune cells from 25 healthy donors and 50 cases including 25 new-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients prior to systemic treatment and 25 HCC patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy by multicolor flow cytometry. Flow or beads sorted cells were cultured ex vivo for proliferation and functional analysis. Results Anti-PD-1 therapy significantly increased the levels of IgG and IgA in the periphery of HCC patients. Anti-PD-1 treatment led to an increase in plasmablasts and a notable rise in circulating T follicular regulatory (cTfr) cells, while changes in circulating B cells, T follicular helper cells, or regulatory T cells were not significant. Anti-PD-1 therapy also influenced the proliferation and function of cTfr cells, promoting the differentiation of CD38+ cTfr cells. We observed that the CD38+ Tfr cell subset in the peripheral blood can promote plasmablast differentiation, associated with altered antibody production. Conclusions Together, these data demonstrate the immunomodulatory role of PD-1 in restricting the differentiation and function of human cTfr cells and in regulating humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="During persistent antigen stimulation, exhausted CD8+ T cells are continuously replenished by self-renewing stem-like T cells. However, how CD8+ T cells adapt to chronic stimulation remains unclear. Here, we show that persistent antigen stimulation primes chromatin for regulation by the redox-sensing KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Loss of KEAP1 in T cells impaired control of chronic viral infection. T cell-intrinsic KEAP1 suppressed NRF2 to promote expansion and persistence of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, drive a stem-like T cell response, down-regulate immune checkpoint molecules, and limit T cell receptor (TCR) hyperactivation and apoptosis. NRF2 epigenetically derepressed BACH2 targets and opposed a stem-like program driven by BACH2. In exhausted T cells induced by tonic GD2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) signaling, the effects of KEAP1 deficiency were rescued by inhibiting proximal TCR signaling. Enhancing mitochondrial oxidation improved the expansion and survival of KEAP1-deficient CD8+ GD2 CAR T cells and up-regulated markers associated with stem-like cells. Thus, the KEAP1-NRF2 axis regulates stem-like CD8+ T cells and long-term T cell immunity during chronic antigen exposure.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Genetic studies indicate a causal role for microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the progress made in identifying genetic risk factors, such as CD33, and underlying molecular changes, there are currently limited treatment options for AD. Based on the immune‐inhibitory function of CD33, we hypothesize that inhibition of CD33 activation may reverse microglial suppression and restore their ability to resolve inflammatory processes and mitigate pathogenic amyloid plaques, which may be neuroprotective. Here, we investigate the effects of a competitive inhibitor peptide of CD33 binding, IMAD‐001, on downstream immune response in AD. Method Primary human monocyte‐derived microglia‐like cells (MDMi) and monocytes were treated with IMAD‐001 and we determined its effect on microglial function and immune signaling by measuring gene expression changes in markers of microglial activation by qPCR and amyloid beta (Aβ) uptake by flow cytometry. To measure the in vivo effects, we treated 12‐month‐old 5xFAD mice with weekly subcutaneous injections of 5mg/kg IMAD‐001 or vehicle control for 28 days and examined Aβ clearance by immunohistochemistry and CNS immune cell phenotypes by single‐cell (sc)RNA‐seq. Result IMAD‐001 treatment increased Aβ uptake in primary monocytes. In in vivo experiments, we see clearance of Aβ in the brains of the 5xFAD mice with weekly administration. Using scRNA‐seq of CD45+ cells, we identified the expected populations in the brains of the animals and found that peptide treated mice had an increase in classical dendritic cells and a slight decrease in disease‐associated microglia (DAM) and homeostatic microglia. Microglia cells regulated their phenotype in response to the peptide as well with notable downregulation of CD274/PD‐L1, an immunosuppressive molecule in which disruption of its interaction with PD‐1 was found to clear Aβ and improve cognitive performance. Interestingly, peptide treatment resulted in downregulation of IFITM3 and upregulation of CD74, suggesting CD33 inhibition influences microglia to inhibit Aβ production. Conclusion IMAD‐001 inhibition of CD33 resolved Aβ induced suppressed microglial immune signaling and increased microglial phagocytosis and response to their environment in vitro and in vivo, without inducing inappropriate activation, suggesting its potential for therapeutic use in AD.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in controlling gene expression in immune cells, influencing their development, differentiation, and function in both health and disease. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, act as dynamic regulators that allow immune cells to respond to environmental cues, ensuring precise immune responses. In innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, these modifications dictate functional plasticity and antigen-presenting capabilities. In adaptive immune cells, including T cells and B cells, epigenetic changes control lineage commitment, cytokine production, and antibody generation. Dysregulation of these processes can lead to immune-related diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, cancer, and chronic inflammatory conditions. In autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, aberrant epigenetic modifications contribute to the loss of immune tolerance and chronic inflammation. In cancer, altered epigenetic states in both immune cells and tumor cells promote immune evasion and tumor progression. The understanding of these mechanisms has opened new therapeutic avenues, with epigenetic therapies being explored for reprogramming immune responses. This review highlights the role of epigenetic regulation in immune cell function, discusses its dysregulation in disease, and explores its therapeutic potential for improving immune-related outcomes.

        <tr id="Simple Summary The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin Reed–Sternberg cells, the diagnostic hallmark of the disease, exhibit overexpression of TNF receptor family members such as CD30 and CD40. These molecules have a critical roles in the survival and proliferation of Hodgkin Reed–Sternberg cells. Therefore, targeting these TNF receptors represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Therapies that target CD30 have already shown efficacy in clinical settings. Checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have demonstrated high response rates in patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in those who have not responded to conventional therapies. By understanding how TNF signaling interacts with immune checkpoints, researchers can design more effective treatment regimens that simultaneously target multiple pathways.">

        <tr id="Various combination therapies have been investigated to overcome the limitations of using immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, determining the optimal combination therapy remains challenging. To overcome the therapeutical limitation, we conducted a translational research to elucidate the mechanisms by which AXL inhibition enhances the anti-tumor effects when combined with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. Herein, we demonstrated improved antitumor effects through combination treatment with denfivontinib and pembrolizumab which resulted in enhanced differentiation into effector CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells, accompanied by an increase in IFN-γ expression in the YHIM-2004 xenograft model derived from patients with NSCLC. Concurrently, a reduction in the number of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells was observed. Mechanistically, denfivontinib potentiated the NOD-like receptor pathway, thereby facilitating the NLRP3 inflammasome formation. This leads to macrophage activation via the NF-kB signaling pathway activation. We have confirmed that the positive interaction between macrophages and T cells arises from the enhanced antigen-presenting machinery of activated macrophages. Furthermore, the observed tumor effects in AXL knock-out mice confirmed that AXL inhibition by denfivontinib enhances the anti-tumor effects, thus opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at overcoming limitations in immunotherapy. To demonstrate the extent to which our findings reflect clinical results, we analyzed bulk-RNA sequencing data from 21 NSCLC patients undergoing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The NLRP3 inflammasome score influenced enhanced immune responses in patient data undergoing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, suggesting a role for NLRP3 inflammasome in activating immune responses during treatment.">

 Secretory IgA (sIgA) is critical for the maintenance of the mucosal barrier function, preventing bacterial translocation and reducing the risk of chronic inflammation. Several decades of research have revealed a dysregulation of the B-cell compartment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of yet unknown origin1,2. While increased serum levels of (auto)antibodies against S. cerevisiae or the intestinal M-cell expressed FimH receptor glycoprotein 2 (GP2) are observed in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD)3, some studies indicated an impaired generation of intestinal immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells (PCs)4. To unravel the role of mucosal humoral immunity in CD pathogenesis, we aimed to provide an in-depth characterisation of colonic PC differentiation in patients with CD.



 In-depth phenotyping of patients with CD in remission and non-IBD controls (hospitalised normals) was performed using multi-omics analyses (spatial single-cell proteomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) of plasma or colon biopsy samples. Colonic switched memory B cells (sMBCs) were sorted from lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNCs) by magnetic-activated cell sorting and ex vivo differentiated into PCs. The impact of mitochondrial function on colonic PC maturation was studied in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V-deficient ATP8 mutant mice and mice that underwent nutritional intervention.



 Despite a hyperactive colonic B-cell compartment, patients with CD displayed significantly diminished mucosal dimeric IgA (dIgA) and fecal IgA compared to non-IBD controls. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) expression did not differ, excluding a defective epithelial transcytosis of dIgA. Spatial single-cell proteomics uncovered that colonic plasmablasts and immature CD19+CD45+ PCs were increased at the expense of the fully mature CD19-CD45- phenotype. Consistently, PCs generated ex vivo from CD-derived sMBCs revealed impaired capacity to differentiate into IgA-secreting PCs. Metabolic phenotyping indicated a colonic mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with CD that was also reflected in colonic PCs by increased expression of the cell-surface NADase CD38 in concert with decreased expression of mitochondrially encoded transcripts. Of note, splenic PCs isolated from ATP8 mutant mice displayed a hyperproliferative and low-differentiated phenotype, while colonic IgA-secreting PCs were reduced. Conversely, feeding mice an isocaloric glucose-free, high-protein diet, which promotes mitochondrial activity, increased colonic IgA levels.



 In summary, this study links mitochondrial dysfunction to impaired PC differentiation in patients with CD, resulting in reduced levels of sIgA and thereby compromised mucosal barrier integrity.

        <tr id="Cytokines play a crucial role in mediating cell communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages are particularly influential in the regulation of immunosuppressive cytokines, thereby supporting tumor metastasis. The upregulation of Th2 cytokines in cancer cells is recognized for its involvement in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, the association between these cytokines and tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the connection between tumor-promoting macrophages and melanoma-derived EVs. The analysis from altered cytokine profile data showed that melanoma-derived EVs upregulate Th2 cytokine expression in naïve macrophages, thereby contributing to the promotion of tumor-supporting functions. Notably, many of these cytokines were also found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma patients (n = 30) compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Overall, our findings suggest a strong connection between melanoma secretory EVs and the induction of tumor-associated macrophages that facilitates the development of an immunosuppressive TME, supporting melanoma metastasis through regulation at both local and systemic levels.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Objective To elucidate the role of phosphatidylcholine‐specific phospholipase C (PC‐PLC) in the antituberculosis (anti‐TB) immune response mediated by dendritic cells (DCs). Methods In vivo, C57BL/6J mice infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. Before infection, the mice were pretreated with the PC‐PLC inhibitor D609. Bacillary loads in lung and spleen tissues were quantified through colony‐forming unit (CFU) assays. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to assess inflammatory infiltration and tissue damage. Levels of inflammatory mediators in peripheral venous blood were quantified using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Flow cytometry was employed to determine the proportions of conventional DCs (cDCs) and their subsets, cDC1 and cDC2, within lung, spleen, and lymph node tissues. In vitro, mouse bone marrow‐derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pretreated with D609. The expression levels of chemokines and pro‐inflammatory cytokines were assessed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. BMDCs were loaded with H37Rv expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP‐H37Rv) or DQ‐OVA, and flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the impact of D609 on antigen phagocytosis and processing. Furthermore, flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the effect of D609 pretreatment on the expression levels of costimulatory molecules on BMDCs. The capacity of D609‐treated BMDCs to activate and proliferate T cells, as well as to induce interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) secretion, was assessed through a DC‐T cell coculture system. Results In vivo analysis revealed that mice pretreated with D609 exhibited a marked increase in tissue bacterial load, enhanced inflammatory infiltration, and a reduction in pro‐inflammatory mediator expression in peripheral venous blood. There was a notable decrease in the number of cDCs in lung and lymph node tissues, with a pronounced reduction in cDC1 in the lungs and cDC2 in the lymph nodes. In vitro studies demonstrated that D609 pretreated BMDCs displayed a significant decline in inflammatory mediator production, antigen phagocytosis, and antigen processing capabilities, potentially due to altered expression of costimulatory molecules. Coculture experiments indicated that D609 pretreated BMDCs showed a substantial reduction in their ability to stimulate T cell activation, proliferation, and IFN‐γ secretion. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PC‐PLC plays a critical role in the functionality of DCs, including the production of chemokines and pro‐inflammatory cytokines, migration to lymph nodes, and antigen presentation to T cells, which collectively contribute to T cell activation and effective clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms of PC‐PLC in DCs may uncover novel therapeutic targets for the development of advanced anti‐TB treatments.">

        <tr id="Organisms constantly face environmental stressors that threaten their cellular and genomic integrity. In their response, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and/or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and trigger the innate immune response. In this study we tested the hypothesis that DAMPs contribute to radiation-induced cellular plasticity in Glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is known to be organized hierarchically with a small number of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) driving treatment resistance and recurrences. Using patient-derived GBM specimens, we employed sphere forming capacity assays and in vitro extreme limiting dilution assays to examine how innate immune receptor signaling impacts the maintenance and self-renewal of GICs. By leveraging an imaging system for putative GICs we determined de novo induction of GICs from non-stem glioma cells. We find that GIC maintenance after irradiation is mediated by cGAS-independent STING signaling, possibly involving signaling through TLR4 and TLR9. Induction of radiation-induced plasticity involves TLR3 signaling, with potential roles for other receptors and processes modulated by MyD88. These findings suggest that targeting innate immune signaling could prevent radiation-induced cellular plasticity for potential therapeutic benefit.">

Natural killer cells (NK cells) play a key role in liver immunosurveillance, but in the tumor microenvironment, NK cells are readily depleted, as evidenced by down-regulation of activating receptors, reduced cytokine secretion, and attenuated killing function. The up-regulation of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, further exacerbates the depletion of NK cells. Combined blockade strategies targeting these immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with other inhibitory pathways (eg.

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) provide frontline protection against pathogens and emerging malignancies. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with TRM features are associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, the cellular interactions that program TRM differentiation and function are not well understood. Using murine genetic models and targeted spatial transcriptomics, we found that the CD8+ T cell-derived chemokine XCL1 is critical for TRM formation and conventional DC1 (cDC1) supported the positioning of intestinal CD8+ T cells during acute viral infection. In tumors, enforced Xcl1 expression by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells promoted intratumoral cDC1 accumulation and T cell persistence, leading to improved overall survival. Notably, analysis of human TIL and TRM revealed conserved expression of XCL1 and XCL2. Thus, we have shown that the XCL1-XCR1 axis plays a non-cell autonomous role in guiding intestinal CD8+ TRM spatial differentiation and tumor control.">

We systematically analyzed an established immunotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), by assessing 348,905 single-cell transcriptomes from 74 longitudinal bone marrow samples of 25 patients with relapsed leukemia; a subset was evaluated by both protein- and transcriptome-based spatial analysis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) DLI responders, we identified clonally expanded ZNF683+ CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with in vitro specificity for patient-matched AML. These cells originated primarily from the DLI product and appeared to coordinate antitumor immune responses through interaction with diverse immune cell types within the marrow microenvironment. Nonresponders lacked this cross-talk and had cytotoxic T lymphocytes with elevated TIGIT expression.

        <tr id="Abstract The elderly and those with chronic diseases have a 2 to 10-fold increased risk of hospitalization and mortality following infection as compared with healthy adults. A significant contributor to disease severity is the aging of the immune system, including an expansion of exhausted T cells. These cells simultaneously promote excessive levels of inflammation and display impaired T cell activation and function. How exhausted T cells from aged individuals respond to infection and whether acute restoration of T cell activation further exacerbates the inflammatory environment or generates functional T cells is unclear. Previously, we used a mouse model of normal microbial experience (NME), where old specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice show 100% mortality following exposure to multiple microbes ordinarily found in pet store mice. In the present study, we show that when exposed to NME, old SPF mice have increased expression of multiple inflammatory pathways and exhibit elevated frequencies of a heterogenous exhausted CD8+ T cell pool that expresses differing combinations of the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), TOX, and CXCR5. Pre-treatment or intervention with an anti-PD1 monoclonal blocking antibody during the exposure of old SPF mice to NME significantly improves both antibody production and survival, without altering the acute inflammatory response. Anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade-mediated survival is dependent on CD8+, but not CD4+ T cells. Correspondingly, CD8+ PD1+ T cells from old mice given anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody have increased granzyme B production. These data reveal a new approach for reducing vulnerability to infections in the elderly by targeting CD8+ T cell exhaustion through PD1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the key immunosuppressive components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and contribute to tumor development, progression, and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Several reagents targeting TAMs have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies, but they have had limited success. Here, we show that a unique reagent, FF-10101, exhibited a sustained inhibitory effect against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor by forming a covalent bond and reduced immunosuppressive TAMs in the TME, which led to strong antitumor immunity. In preclinical animal models, FF-10101 treatment significantly reduced immunosuppressive TAMs and increased antitumor TAMs in the TME. In addition, tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were increased; consequently, tumor growth was significantly inhibited. Moreover, combination treatment with an anti–programmed cell death 1 (anti–PD-1) antibody and FF-10101 exhibited a far stronger antitumor effect than either treatment alone. In human cancer specimens, FF-10101 treatment reduced programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on TAMs, as observed in animal models. Thus, FF-10101 acts as an immunomodulatory agent that can reduce immunosuppressive TAMs and augment tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, thereby generating an immunostimulatory TME. We propose that FF-10101 is a potential candidate for successful combination cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.">

 Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine linked to inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where it contributes to inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis. Despite its established role, the specific signals driving OSM expression in colitis remain unclear.



 Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated using M-CSF and stimulated for 36 hours with a range of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and bacterial lysates. OSM secretion was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To dissect key signaling pathways, we applied chemical inhibitors and utilized macrophages derived from gene-deficient mice.



 Myd88-dependent stimuli, including TLR1/2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR4 (LPS), TLR2/6 (FSL-1), TLR7/8 (R848), IL-1α, and IL-33, significantly increased OSM expression in BMDMs. Gram-negative (E. coli, C. rodentium) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacterial lysates also enhanced OSM secretion. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ further boosted OSM levels, consistent with in vivo findings of OSM upregulation in inflammatory monocytes. Additionally, IL-4, which induces a tissue repair phenotype in macrophages, markedly increased OSM secretion.



 OSM expression in BMDMs is driven by multiple signaling pathways, indicating a synergistic effect of diverse stimuli. Identifying key stimulatory and inhibitory molecules, alongside macrophage-specific knockout analyses, will help clarify the upstream regulators of OSM. Understanding these drivers may uncover new therapeutic targets in IBD and offer insights into the onset of fibrotic processes.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Tumour-infiltrating T cells can mediate both antitumour immunity and promote tumour progression by creating an immunosuppressive environment. This dual role is especially relevant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterised by a unique microenvironment and limited success with current immunotherapy.


OBJECTIVE
We evaluated T cell responses in patients with advanced HCC by analysing tumours, liver flushes and liver-draining lymph nodes, to understand whether reactive T cell populations could be identified despite the immunosuppressive environment.


DESIGN
T cells isolated from clinical samples were tested for reactivity against predicted neoantigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to evaluate the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of antigen-experienced T cells. Neoantigen-reactive T cells expressing 4-1BB were isolated and characterised through T-cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing.


RESULTS
Bioinformatic analysis identified 542 candidate neoantigens from seven patients. Of these, 78 neoantigens, along with 11 hotspot targets from HCC driver oncogenes, were selected for ex vivo T cell stimulation. Reactivity was confirmed in co-culture assays for 14 targets, with most reactive T cells derived from liver flushes and lymph nodes. Liver flush-derived T cells exhibited central memory and effector memory CD4+ with cytotoxic effector profiles. In contrast, tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an exhausted profile were primarily identified in the draining lymph nodes.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer valuable insights into the functional profiles of neoantigen-reactive T cells within and surrounding the HCC microenvironment. T cells isolated from liver flushes and tumour-draining lymph nodes may serve as a promising source of reactive T cells and TCRs for further use in immunotherapy for HCC.">

        <tr id="Background: The innate immune response aims to prevent pathogens from entering the organism and/or to facilitate pathogen clearance. Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells (MCs), natural killer cells and neutrophils, bear pattern recognition receptors and are thus able to recognize common molecular patterns, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the later occurring in the context of neuroinflammation. An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise “primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative” disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention. Activated MCs are multifunctional effector cells generated from hematopoietic stem cells that, together with dendritic cells, represent first-line immune defense mechanisms against pathogens and/or tissue destruction. Methods: This review aims to summarize evidence of MC implication in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Results: In view of recent evidence that the gut–brain axis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the characterization of the neuroinflammatory component in the pathology of these diseases, this review also focuses on MCs as potential mediators in the gut–brain axis bi-directional communication and the possible role of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen known to alter the gut–brain axis homeostasis towards local and systemic pro-inflammatory responses. Conclusion: As MCs and Helicobacter pylori infection may offer targets of intervention with potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disease, more clinical and translational evidence is needed to elucidate this field.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Accumulating evidence suggests that phenotype switching of cancer cells is essential for therapeutic resistance. However, the immunological characteristics of drug-induced phenotype-switching melanoma cells (PSMCs) are unknown. We investigated PSMC elimination by host immunity using hyperdifferentiated melanoma model cells derived from murine B16F10 melanoma cells. Exposure of B16F10 cells to staurosporine induced a hyperdifferentiated phenotype associated with transient drug tolerance. Staurosporine-induced hyperdifferentiated B16F10 (sB16F10) cells expressed calreticulin on their surface and were phagocytosed efficiently. Furthermore, the inoculation of mice with sB16F10 cells induced immune responses against tumor-derived antigens. Despite the immunogenicity of sB16F10 cells, they activated the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system and strongly resisted T cell-mediated tumor destruction. However, in vivo treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors successfully eliminated the tumor. Thus, hyperdifferentiated melanoma cells have conflicting immunological properties – enhanced immunogenicity and immune evasion. Inhibiting the ability of PSMCs to evade T cell-mediated elimination might lead to complete melanoma eradication.">

 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with severe chronic inflammatory conditions that are refractory to conventional treatment, including Crohn’s disease. The success of aHSCT is thought to be grounded in resetting the break of immunological tolerance, but the exact mechanisms underlying a favourable response remain incompletely understood.



 We followed the immune reconstitution of 9 patients with severe refractory Crohn’s disease from one month until more than 2 years post-aHSCT. We performed flow cytometry to follow immune cell populations and functional T cells markers over time, in addition to Olink proteomics to study the inflammatory response in serum.



 Transplantation proceeded safely, without major adverse events in any of the 9 patients. aHSCT resulted in considerable improvement of disease status in 6 patients, with 3 patients classified as non-responders. After transplantation, we observed a strong change in the peripheral T-cell subset composition, with a reduction of the CD4/CD8 ratio and a reduction of naïve over effector memory (EM) T cells. Non-responders appeared distinct by a higher CD4/CD8 ratio and higher naïve over T-EM frequencies already before transplantation, and a smaller change in subset composition after transplantation. Remarkably, the local T-cell composition did not mirror the changes in the periphery, with an increased CD4/CD8 ratio in intestinal biopsies post-aHSCT, underscoring that a more detailed study of local versus peripheral responses to aHSCT is essential in aiding our understanding of its efficacy. Functionally, the changes in the peripheral T-cell profile were minimal and not clearly related to response. Although the pro-inflammatory profile was not altered, we did find a small but significant increase in the expression of regulatory markers.



 aHSCT resulted in strong changes in the T-cell subset composition of Crohn’s disease patients, but only small changes in functional markers related to inflammation, regulation and homing. Non-responders could be distinguished at baseline by a different T-cell composition and also experienced less profound changes herein upon transplantation.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immunotherapy that targets immune checkpoints has achieved revolutionary success, but its application in solid tumors remains limited, highlighting the need for reliable enhancement of the efficacy of immunotherapy. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a Golgi membrane protein, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including immune regulation. Recent studies suggested that GP73 may play a role in modulating the immune response in patients with cancer. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which GP73 regulates T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment. Methods We used T-cell specific GP73 knockout mice to establish MC38 and B16 tumor models to investigate the impact of GP73-deficient T cells on tumor growth. Single-cell sequencing was subsequently employed to classify tumor-infiltrating immune cells and assess changes in cytokines and metabolic genes. Through RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, seahorse analysis, glucose uptake, and L-lactic acid secretion assays, we explored how GP73 regulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) to influence T-cell antitumor functionality. Furthermore, we established adoptive transfer experiments to study the ability of GP73-overexpressing T cells to combat tumors. Blood samples of patient with clinical tumor were collected to assess the relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and T-cell GP73 levels. Results In this study, the absence of GP73 in mouse T cells promoted tumor growth and metastasis, accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+T cell subsets infiltrating the tumor and an increase in exhausted CD8+ T-cell subsets. Further analysis revealed that the effector function of CD8+T cells in tumors relies on glycolysis regulated by HIF-1α rather than immune checkpoints. GP73-deficient T cells exhibit severely impaired glycolysis in hypoxic environments, whereas ectopic GP73 expression restores HIF-1α levels. In adoptive immunotherapy, overexpression of GP73 in T cells inhibits tumor growth. In cytotoxicity assays, knockdown of GP73 affected the ability of CD8+T cells to kill target cells. Clinically, tumor immunotherapy partial response patients present significantly elevated levels of GP73 expression in T cells. Conclusions These findings reveal the role of GP73 in regulating T-cell glycolysis and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the prognosis and treatment of clinical tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Solid organ transplantation has significantly improved the survival rate of patients with terminal organ failure. However, its success is often compromised by allograft rejection, a process in which T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a crucial role. These cells facilitate rejection by enhancing neutrophil infiltration into the graft and by activating endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Additionally, Th17 cells can trigger the activation of other T cell types, including Th1, Th2, and CD8+ T cells, further contributing to rejection. An imbalance between Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is known to promote rejection. To counteract this, immunosuppressive drugs have been developed to inhibit T cell activity and foster transplant tolerance. Another approach involves the adoptive transfer of regulatory cells, such as Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, to dampen T cell functions. This review primarily focuses on the roles of Th17 cells in rejection and their interactions with other T cell subsets. We also explore various strategies aimed at suppressing T cells to induce tolerance.">

 Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract, with a globally rising incidence. It may result from a complex interaction among genetic predisposition, environmental influences, and alterations in gut microbiota, leading to dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Despite advances in understanding CD, the precise immunological mechanisms underlying this disease remain unclear. Currently, biological therapies, such as vedolizumab, are among the most effective options for inducing clinical remission and controlling inflammation in CD. However, approximately two-thirds of patients do not respond adequately to these treatments. Consequently, it is essential to identify immune cell populations that can predict clinical responses to vedolizumab, facilitating more personalized treatment selection for each patient.



 We characterized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using spectral flow cytometry with a panel of 40 markers in patients with CD, both before and after 14 weeks of treatment with vedolizumab. Patients were categorized as responders or non-responders based on their SES-CD.



 At baseline Hierarchical phenotypic analysis revealed a total of 39 unique subsets of immune cells within PBMCs (Figure 1). The main populations included T cells (66%), monocytes (0.25%), B cells (12%), and natural killer cells (11%). Within the T cell group, CD4+ cells were twice as prevalent as CD8+ cells. In our evaluation of conventional dendritic cells percentages, we noted an increase in this subset within the responder group, contrasting with the trend observed in macrophages. Furthermore, an unsupervised analysis applying dimensionality reduction algorithms identified 59 clusters (Figure 2), with 37 of them showing differences when comparing responder and non-responder patients. Interestingly, no differences were observed between pre-treatment and post-treatment samples.



 This study presents the first immunophenotyping analysis in CD patients, comparing responders and non-responders to vedolizumab based on SES-CD and highlighting differences between these groups. For the first time, these results reveal circulating immune populations as potential predictors of response to vedolizumab. Although these findings should be validated in a larger cohort to assess their clinical significance in identifying patients most likely to benefit from each therapeutic approach, they open the possibility for changes in clinical practice.

        <tr id="T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for B cell activation and subsequent antibody production. This functionality is influenced by surface markers such as CD40L, a costimulatory factor which promotes B cell activation, and CD57 which is a well-known marker of senescence. This study examined age-specific differences in Tfh cell function in Bangladeshi and American children. At age two, Bangladeshi children displayed impaired CD40L upregulation and significant CD57 downregulation upon stimulation. These patterns, not observed in American children of the same age, suggested an exhaustion-like phenotype potentially driven by environmental factors. Predictors of Tfh cell response to stimulation were analyzed using Random Forest and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models. Exclusive breastfeeding duration, antibiotic treatments, diarrheal episodes, and malnutrition were identified as variables that significantly impacted the Tfh response to stimuli. To assess Tfh cell ability to promote antibody responses, we correlated Tfh functionality with antibody concentration post-vaccination and in response to infection with Cryptosporidium, an endemic apicomplexan parasite. Increased CD40L expression upon stimulation correlated positively with anti-Poliovirus type 2/3 neutralizing antibody and anti-Cp17 (a Cryptosporidium sporozoite antigen) IgA concentrations. In contrast, increased CD57 expression was significantly correlated with decreased anti-Cp17 IgA. This indicates that an activation-supportive phenotype (CD40L+) may be more effective in promoting immunity than a senescent phenotype (CD57+). Together, these findings suggest that early-life environmental exposures may program Tfh cell functionality, impacting immune response potential in settings with high pathogen exposure.">

Of note, the modulation of cytokine production and its release can significantly influence the immune response. Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are cytokines that play a crucial role in innate immunity due to their potent antiviral effects, regulation of IFN-stimulated genes essential for viral clearance, and the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, an understanding of the dual role of IFN-I (protective versus harmful) during HIV-1 infections and elucidating its contributions to HIV pathogenesis is crucial for advancing HIV therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is mostly refractory to immunotherapy due to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and cancer cell-intrinsic T cell tolerance mechanisms. PDAC is described as a “cold” tumor type with poor infiltration by T cells and factors leading to intratumoral T cell suppression have thus received less attention. Here, we identify a cancer cell-intrinsic mechanism that contributes to a T cell-resistant phenotype and describes potential combinatorial therapy. Methods We used an unbiased screening approach of T cell resistant and sensitive murine KPC (KrasLSL-G12D/+; Trp53fl/fl; Ptf1aCre/+) PDAC cells in a three-dimensional co-culture platform with syngeneic antigen-educated T cells to identify potential cell-intrinsic drivers of T cell suppression in PDAC. Comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed to reveal promising candidates that mediate resistance to T cells. We investigated their contribution by shRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition in murine in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as in patient-derived organoids (PDOs). A combination of transcriptomic analyses, cytometric and immunohistochemistry techniques allowed us to validate the underlying T cell response phenotypes of PDAC cells. The action of TGM2 via interaction with tubulin and the impact of microtubule dynamics and vesicle trafficking were evaluated by protein analyses and live-cell imaging. Correlation analyses via TCGA data complemented the functional studies. Results We identified transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) as a mediator of T cell suppression in PDAC. We report that high levels of TGM2 expression in patients’ tumors correlate with immunosuppressive signatures and poor overall survival. We found that TGM2 regulates vesicle trafficking by modulating microtubule network density and dynamics in pancreatic cancer cells, thus facilitating the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, which impair effector T cell functionality. In TGM2-expressing PDOs, pharmacological TGM2 inhibition or treatment with nocodazole increased T cell-mediated apoptosis. Also, pretreatment of TGM2high PDOs with sublethal doses of the spindle poisons paclitaxel or vincristine increased CD8+T cell activation and sensitized PDOs toward T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Conclusions These findings indicate that targeting microtubular function therapeutically may enhance antitumor T cell responses by impacting activity of immunosuppressive cytokines in the PDAC microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Abstract The treatment landscape for lymphoma and multiple myeloma, which disproportionally affect older adults, has been transformed by the advent of T cell-mediated immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibition, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, during the last decade. These treatment modalities re-enable the patient’s own immune system to combat malignant cells and offer the potential for sustained remissions and cure for various diseases. Age profoundly affects the physiological function of the immune system. The process of biological aging is largely driven by inflammatory signaling, which is reciprocally fueled by aging-related alterations of physiology and metabolism. In the T cell compartment, aging contributes to T cell senescence and exhaustion, increased abundance of terminally differentiated cells, a corresponding attrition in naïve T cell numbers, and a decrease in the breadth of the receptor repertoire. Furthermore, inflammatory signaling drives aging-related pathologies and contributes to frailty in older individuals. Thus, there is growing evidence of biological aging modulating the efficacy and toxicity of T cell-mediated immunotherapies. Here, we review the available evidence from biological and clinical studies focusing on the relationship between T cell-mediated treatment of hematologic malignancies and age. We discuss biological features potentially impacting clinical outcomes in various scenarios, and potential strategies to improve the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T cell therapy in older patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects. Further research is expected to enhance the efficacy and safety of MSCs-based treatments for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation after stem cell or solid organ transplantation remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this setting. T-cell receptor (TCR)-like antibodies bind to intracellular peptides presented in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the cell surface and may have the potential to replace T-cell function in immunocompromised patients. Three previously selected CMV-specific, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted (HLA-A*0101, HLA-A*0201 and HLA-B*0702) Fab-antibodies (A6, C1 and C7) were produced as IgG antibodies with Fc optimization. All antibodies showed specific binding to CMV peptide-loaded tumor cell lines and primary fibroblasts expressing the corresponding MHC-I molecules, leading to specific target cell lysis after the addition of natural killer (NK) cells. When deployed in combination as an antibody pool against target cells expressing more than one matching HLA allele, cytotoxic effects were amplified accordingly. CMV-specific TCR-like antibodies were also able to mediate their cytotoxic effects through neutrophils, which is important considering the delayed recovery of NK cells after stem cell transplantation. When tested on patient blood obtained during CMV reactivation, CMV-specific antibodies were able to bind to and induce cytotoxic effects in lymphocytes. CMV-specific TCR-like antibodies may find application in patients with CMV reactivation or at risk of CMV reactivation. In contrast to previous HLA/peptide-directed therapeutic approaches, the concept of a TCR-like antibody repertoire covering more than one HLA allele would make this therapeutic format available to a much larger group of patients.">

        <tr id="Consolidation with PD-1/PD-L1-based immune checkpoint blockade after concurrent platinum-based chemo-radiotherapy has become the new standard of care for advanced stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In order to further improve therapy outcomes, innovative combinatorial treatment strategies aim to target additional immunosuppressive barriers in the tumor microenvironment such as the CD73/adenosine pathway. CD73 and adenosine are known as crucial endogenous regulators of lung homeostasis and inflammation, but also contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the CD73/adenosine pathway can also limit the immune-activating effects of cytotoxic therapies by degrading the pro-inflammatory danger molecule ATP, which is released into the tumor microenvironment and normal lung tissue upon therapy-induced cell damage. Thus, while targeting CD73 may enhance the efficacy of radio-immunotherapies in cancer treatment by mitigating tumor immune escape and improving immune-mediated tumor killing, it also raises concerns about increased immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in the normal tissue. In fact, combined radio-immunotherapies bear an increased risk of irAEs in the lungs, and additional pharmacologic inhibition of CD73 may further enhance the risk of overwhelming or overlapping pulmonary toxicity and thereby limit therapy outcome. This review explores how therapeutic interventions targeting CD73/adenosine dynamics could enhance radiation-induced immune activation in combined radio-immunotherapies, whilst potentially driving irAEs in the lung. We specifically investigate the interactions between radiotherapy and the CD73/adenosine pathway in radiation pneumonitis. Additionally, we compare the incidence of (radiation) pneumonitis reported in relevant trials to determine if there is an increased risk of irAEs in the clinical setting. By understanding these dynamics, we aim to inform future strategies for optimizing radio-immunotherapy regimens, ensuring effective cancer control while preserving pulmonary integrity and patient quality of life.">

While these therapies are primarily known for their direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, accumulating evidence indicates that they also influence the tumor microenvironment (TME), by altering the cytokine milieu and recruiting additional effector populations to help orchestrate the antitumor immune response. Conversely, the TME itself can modulate the behaviour of these therapies within the host by either supporting or inhibiting their activity. In this review we provide an overview of clinical and preclinical data on the bidirectional influences between T cell therapies and the TME. Unravelling the interactions between T cell-based therapies and the TME is critical for a better understanding of their mechanisms of action, resistance, and toxicity, with the goal of optimizing efficacy and safety.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with gastrectomy being the primary treatment option. Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, may influence tumor growth by creating an immunosuppressive environment conducive to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Here, the effect of abdominal infection on tumor growth and metastasis was investigated through the implementation of a peritoneal metastasis model and a subcutaneous tumor model. In a murine model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to simulate the effects of sepsis, we observed significant immune dysregulation, including T-cell exhaustion and the release of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). This immune alteration was associated with increased programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression on T cells and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment, fostering an immune-suppressive environment. Polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) expressing elevated PD-L1 after sepsis demonstrated more substantial suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation than controls. Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies successfully restored T-cell function, reduced mortality, and decreased metastasis in CLP mice. These findings emphasize the impact of sepsis on tumor progression and suggest targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a potential therapeutic strategy for managing immune dysfunction in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Natural killer (NK) cells are integral components of the innate immune system, serving a vital function in eliminating virally infected cells. This review highlights the significance of CXCR5+ NK cells in the context of chronic HIV/SIV infection and viral control.


RECENT FINDINGS
Controlled HIV/SHIV infection results in a substantial increase in the population of CXCR5+ NK cells within the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). These CXCR5+ NK cells display enhanced functional characteristics, including elevated expression of activation markers and increased cytokine production, which are essential for effective viral control. These follicular NK cells are shown to be enriched in IL-15 signaling, and CXCR5 NK cells are negatively associated with viral burden during chronic HIV and SHIV infection.


SUMMARY
The distinct phenotypic and functional attributes of CXCR5+ NK cells, particularly in the lymphoid tissues of individuals living with HIV, emphasize their critical contribution to the anti-HIV-1 immune response. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and roles of CXCR5+ NK cells may present novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing NK-mediated viral control.">

 Resident intestinal macrophages play a key role in maintaining gut homeostasis and exhibit a hypoactive tolerogenic phenotype. Recently, several subsets of intestinal macrophages have been identified based on CD11c expression which differ in their inflammatory and functional profiles. Notably, pro-inflammatory CD11c+ monocyte-like macrophages are found elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). These cells are recruited from blood monocytes via the CCR2/CCL2 chemokine pathway. Our study is focused on observing the patterns of CCL2-driven blood monocyte migration and their translation into subsets of intestinal tissue macrophages that can determine the degree of gut inflammation in newly diagnosed patients.



 Patients referred with suspected IBD were seen in an inception clinic. Intestinal biopsies and matched blood samples were obtained from pre-treatment UC and CD patients during their index colonoscopy. Those with inflammation excluded during this procedure formed a ‘non-IBD’ control group. Biopsy segments were cultured to generate conditioned media and also digested for flow cytometry analysis. Plasma concentrations of CCL2 and intestinal secretome were measured using ELISA or Olink proteomic analysis respectively. Efficacy of blood monocyte chemotaxis towards CCL2 was assessed in the presence or absence of CCL2/CCR2 antagonists and the profile of monocyte subsets in whole blood were determined using whole blood flow cytometry analysis.



 As previously described, we observed distinct CD11c+ and CD11c- macrophage populations in IBD intestinal tissue, with expansion of the CD11c+ subset within inflamed regions which expressed higher levels of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1. Higher concentrations of CCL2 were observed in conditioned media from inflamed IBD tissue compared to non-inflamed regions and this correlated with elevated numbers of circulating blood monocytes. Chemotaxis assays revealed a corresponding increase in CCL2-induced monocyte migration in patients with IBD compared to the ‘non-IBD’ control group.



 Our study provides further insights into the role of the CCL2/CCR2 chemokine axis in driving monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into pro-inflammatory intestinal macrophages in IBD. We demonstrate that inflamed intestinal regions exhibit elevated levels of CCL2 correlating with an expansion of the CD11c⁺ macrophage subset and increased CCL2-driven monocyte migration in these subjects. These findings underscore the significance of targeting the CCL2/CCR2 pathway and that it might be an important driver in the development IBD.

        <tr id="Given the limited comprehensive data on the bone marrow (BM) immune environment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we analyzed the distribution and phenotype of T cell subsets, including γδ T cells, and their immune checkpoint (IC) ligands on blasts. We performed multiparametric flow cytometry with BM samples taken from 89 AML patients at the time of diagnosis, remission, and relapse/refractory status after chemotherapy and 13 healthy controls (HCs) to identify immune-related risk factors. Compared to the HCs, the T cells of the AML patients exhibited exhausted features including higher TIGIT levels and similar levels of PD-1 and TIM-3. The γδ T cells were exhausted by the upregulation of TIGIT and/or TIM-3 and downregulation of NKG2D and NKp30, with different patterns in the Vδ1 and Vδ2 subtypes. A successful chemotherapeutic response partially restored the exhausted phenotypes of the T cell subsets. The simultaneous analysis of IC receptors on the T cell subsets and their ligands on blasts showed the prognostic value of a specific IC receptor–ligand pair and the feasibility of risk stratification based on their diverse patterns. Our findings clarified the BM T cell landscape in AML, unveiling the prognostic value of γδ T cells in both diagnosis and remission predictions.">

        <tr id="The precise mechanisms by which the complement system contributes to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and promotes tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of complement C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) in human and mouse cancer-associated dendritic cells (DCs). First, we observed an overexpression of C5aR1 in tumor-infiltrating DCs, compared to DCs from blood or spleen. C5aR1 expression was restricted to type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which displayed a tolerogenic phenotype capable of inhibiting T-cell activation and promoting tumor growth. C5aR1 engagement in DCs drove their migration from tumors to tumor-draining lymph nodes, where C5a levels were higher. We used this knowledge to optimize an anticancer therapy aimed at enhancing DC activity. In three syngeneic tumor models, C5aR1 inhibition significantly enhanced the efficacy of poly I:C, a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. The contribution of C5aR1 inhibition to the antitumor activity of the combination treatment relied on type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, required lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs, and was associated with an increase in interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in the biology of cancer-associated DCs and provides compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of modulating the complement system to enhance DC-mediated immune responses against tumors.">

        <tr id="Abstract Exposure to ionizing radiation can induce harmful biological effects on the human body, particularly in cases of high-dose γ-irradiation affecting the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, skin and lung. Such exposures lead to lethal outcomes as individuals experience a breakdown in their immune system’s ability to defend against pathogens, predisposing them to sepsis-induced multiple organ failures. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess diverse biological characteristics, including immunomodulation, anti-inflammation and tissue regeneration. Off-the-shelf culture-expanded human bone marrow- or adipose tissue-derived MSCs are clinically available to treat graft-versus-host disease following hematopoietic cell transplantation and perianal fistulas in Crohn’s disease in Japan. While preclinical studies showcase encouraging outcomes in radiation-induced injuries, the effectiveness of MSC transplantation in addressing acute radiation syndrome affecting organs in irradiated individuals is limited. Recent studies have highlighted MSC-releasing extracellular vesicles as nanoparticle substances responsible for outlining the mechanism of action and have identified various components, including proteins and microRNA, that serve as functional molecules. MSC-releasing extracellular vesicle-based therapy emerges as a promising avenue, offering a potential solution to the challenges posed by radiation-induced injuries. However, further investigation is required, especially regarding whether MSC-releasing extracellular vesicles have regenerative effects on tissue-resident stem cells. These unresolved issues represent key aspects that need to be addressed to optimize the therapeutic potential of cell-based and extracellular vesicle-based MSC therapies for interventions in the context of radiation-induced injuries.">

The frequency of monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer (NK), and NKT cells were assessed in blood samples of children and adolescents living with HIV (CALHIV) and HIV-uninfected (HU) children. Blood samples from 10 CALHIV (treated or not) and six HU individuals were collected for approximately one year. Flow cytometry was employed to phenotypically characterize cell populations. We found a lower frequency of classical monocytes in CALHIV patients compared to the HU group (35.75% vs. 62.60%, respectively) but a higher frequency of CD56−CD16+ NK cells in CALHIV patients compared to the HU group (1.45% vs. 0.44%, respectively). At baseline, the frequency of monocytic-MDSCs inversely correlated with CD56dimCD16+ NK cells (r= −0.73, p=0.020), CD56−CD16+ NK cells (r= −0.78, p=0.010), and with intermediate monocytes (r= −0.71, p=0.027) in the CALHIV group. We also found a negative correlation between CD56++CD16+− and CD56dimCD16+ NK cells with CD4 T cells frequency at baseline. The results suggest an alteration in the innate compartment of the CALHIV cohort, which may contribute to their susceptibility to infections.">

        <tr id="The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating anticancer immunity, significantly impacting the effectiveness of various cancer therapies, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Its impact on the development of cancer is complex; certain bacteria, like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis, can stimulate the growth of tumors by causing immunological evasion and inflammation, while advantageous strains, like Faecalibaculum rodentium, have the ability to suppress tumors by modifying immune responses. Cytokine activity and immune system regulation are intimately related. Cytokines including TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 promote tumor development by inhibiting efficient immune surveillance. The gut microbiome exhibits a delicate balance between pro- and anti-tumorigenic factors, as evidenced by the enhancement of anti-tumor immunity by cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-γ. Improved immunotherapy responses are linked to a diverse microbiota, which is correlated with higher tumor infiltration and cytotoxic T-cell activation. Because microbial metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, affect cytokine expression and immune cell activation inside the tumor microenvironment, this link highlights the need to maintain microbial balance for optimal treatment effects. Additionally, through stimulating T-cell activation, bacteria like Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum increase cytokine production and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). An option for overcoming ICI resistance is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), since research suggests that it improves melanoma outcomes by increasing CD8+ T-cell activation. This complex interaction provides an opportunity for novel cancer therapies by highlighting the possibility of microbiome modification as a therapeutic approach in personalized oncology approaches.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the dynamic interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses but their function is dysregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[1-4]. The mechanism that contributes to NK-cell dysregulation in IBD requires further elucidation.



 Using flow cytometry staining, we precisely characterized the frequency, phenotype and function of NK subsets distinguished by CD27 and CD11b in 61 treatment-naive patients with active IBD (including 34 with Crohn’ s disease (CD) and 27 with ulcerative colitis (UC)), as compared to 30 healthy volunteers.



 We observed a significantly increased proportion of the peripheral CD11b-CD27- (double-negative, or DN) NK subsets in IBD patients. Notably, these relatively expanded DN NK subsets exhibited an inactive and immature phenotype. Functional analysis, conducted by stimulating and assessing the expression of CD107a and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), revealed that the DN NK subsets had poor cytotoxic capacity and a deficient potential to produce IFN-γ. In addition, the percentages of DN NK subsets expressing CD107a and IFN-γ were positively correlated with NK degranulation and cytokine production, respectively. Interestingly, we also found that the frequency of DN NK subsets seemed to correlate with the plasma levels of IL-17A. High levels of IL-17A constrain the proliferation and maturation of NK cells in vitro. In some IBD patients who achieved clinical remission after receiving biological agent therapy, the percentage of DN NK subsets decreased accordingly.



 The increased proportion of DN NK subsets may account for NK-cell dysfunction in IBD patients, potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of IL-17A. These alterations in NK cell subsets may contribute to defective killing and thus the secondary infections and increased risk of cancer observed in IBD patients.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) provide clinical benefits for various advanced malignancies. However, the predictive factors that determine sensitivity to ICIs have not been fully elucidated. We focused on tumor-derived CXCL10/11 as a pivotal factor that determines the response to PD-L1 blockade by regulating T cell accumulation and tumor angiogenesis. We previously reported that CXCL10/11 was upregulated by interferon (IFN)-γ in ICI-sensitive tumor cells but not in ICI-resistant cells, including mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). In the present study, gene silencing of tumor-derived CXCL10/11 induced resistance to PD-L1 blockade in AB1-HA mesothelioma cell-bearing mice. To identify the mechanisms underlying ICI resistance, we performed a microarray analysis to compare the IFN-γ-inducible genes between ICI-sensitive AB1-HA and ICI-resistant LLC in vitro. A pathway analysis based on microarray data indicated that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1A is the key signal that inhibits CXCL10/11 expression. We revealed that the HIF1A inhibitors echinomycin (EC) and YC-1 upregulated CXCL10/11 genes induced by IFN-γ in tumor cells in vitro. In addition, combination therapy with PD-L1 blockade and EC demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects in LLC-bearing mice. Combination therapy enhanced tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells and suppressed tumor angiogenesis. The present study suggests that HIF1A signaling in tumor cells dominates ICI resistance via the downregulation of tumor-derived CXCL10/11.">

        <tr id="Radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is a progressive pathology deleteriously impacting cancer survivorship. CXCL12 is an immune-stromal signal implicated in fibrosis and innate response. We hypothesised that modulation of CXCL12 would phenotypically mitigate RIF. CXCL12 expression was characterised in a rodent model of RIF and its expression modulated by the intravascular delivery of lentiviral vectors encoding small hairpin RNA to silence (LVShCXCL12) or overexpress (LVOeCXCL12) CXCL12. Multi-modal fibrotic outcomes were quantified, flow cytometry and Y-chromosome lineage-tracking studies performed to examine cellular recruitment and activation post-radiotherapy (post-RT). Whole-tissue RNA-seq was used to examine matrisomal response. MATBIII tumours were engrafted within tissues with differing levels of CXCL12 expression and tumoral response to RT evaluated. CXCL12 was upregulated in irradiated fibroblasts demonstrating DNA-damage post-RT and led to the recruitment of CD68+ macrophages. Silencing Cxcl12 with LVShCXCL12 demonstrated reduced RIF phenotype as a result of decreased macrophage recruitment. Transcriptomic profiling identified osteopontin (SPP1) as being highly differentially expressed in LVShCXCL12-treated tissues. Tumours growing in tissues devoid of CXCL12 expression responded better following RT due to reductions in peri-tumoural fibrosis as a result of decreased CXCL12 and OPN expression at the tumour/normal tissue interface. This was also associated with greater CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumours with less fibrosis. Antibody-mediated OPN blockade slowed tumour growth by increased intra-tumoral CD8+ T cell activation. The CXCL12/OPN axis is an important node of immune/matrisomal cross-talk in the development of fibrosis. Therapeutic manipulation of this axis may offer greater anti-tumour efficacy whilst also reducing adverse effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) has become a dominant regimen in modern cancer therapy, however immune resistance induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with immune suppressive and evasion properties limits responses. Therefore, the rational design of immune modulators that can control the immune suppressive properties of TAMs and polarize them, as well as dendritic cells (DCs), toward a more proinflammatory phenotype is a principal objective in cancer immunotherapy. Methods Here, using a protein engineering approach to enhance cytokine residence in the tumor microenvironment, we examined combined stimulation of the myeloid compartment via tumor stroma-binding granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to enhance responses in both DCs and T cells via stroma-binding interleukin-12 (IL-12). We evaluated tumor responses at the levels of outcome, cellular responses, and cytokine responses in both the tumors and the tumor-draining lymph nodes. We further investigated the potentiation of DC response to IL-12 by GM-CSF stimulation ex vivo. Results Engineered GM-CSF restored an antitumorigenic tumor myeloid microenvironment otherwise suppressed by TAMs, while engineered IL-12 provided effector signals to T cells, thereby boosting both tumor-resident antitumor macrophage and CD8+ T cell populations. Furthermore, engineered GM-CSF potentiated DC response to IL-12, upregulating DC expression of IL-12 receptor and enhancing their expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines on IL-12 exposure. This resulted in remarkable synergistic efficacy in multiple solid tumor models treated with the dual cytokine combination. The combination therapy also improved the efficacy of CPI in a CPI-resistant genetically-engineered melanoma model and exhibited synergistic antitumor efficacy in a pulmonary metastasis model. Conclusion Our strategy provides a rational design for combination immunotherapy targeting both myeloid and lymphoid compartments through complementary mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment which is a main barrier for immunotherapies of solid cancers. Reducing Treg numbers enhances anti-tumor immune responses but current depletion strategies also impair effector T cells (Teffs), potentially leading to reduced anti-tumor immunity and/or autoimmune diseases. CD137 has been identified as the most differentially expressed gene between peripheral Tregs and intratumoral Tregs in virtually all solid cancers. Further, CD137 is expressed by malignant cells of certain cancers, making it a potential target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we report the development of a fully human anti-human CD137 antibody of the IgG1 isotype, clone P1A1, that induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. P1A1 cross-reacts with murine CD137 which allowed testing murine chimeric P1A1 in syngeneic murine tumor models where P1A1 significantly reduced the number of CD137+ Tregs and inhibited tumor growth in a murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a melanoma lung metastasis model. P1A1 can also be internalized thus enabling it as a carrier for drugs to target CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. These anti-cancer properties suggest a translation of P1A1 to human immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells contribute to antitumor immunity and are implicated in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. In particular, CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells were recently found to block spontaneous breast carcinogenesis. However, the antitumor potential of Th2 cells in targeting established breast cancer remains uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate that Th2 cells induced by the topical calcipotriol/thymic stromal lymphopoietin cytokine axis suppressed the growth of established mammary tumors in mice. Interleukin-24 (IL-24), an anticancer cytokine, was highly upregulated in macrophages infiltrating calcipotriol-treated mammary tumors. Macrophages expressed IL-24 in response to IL-4 signaling in combination with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists (e.g., HMGB1) in vitro. Calcipotriol treatment significantly increased HMGB1 release by tumor cells in vivo. CD4+ T cell depletion reduced HMGB1 and IL-24 expression, reversing calcipotriol’s therapeutic efficacy. Macrophage depletion and TLR4 inhibition also reduced the therapeutic efficacy of calcipotriol. Importantly, calcipotriol treatment failed to control mammary tumors lacking the IL-24 receptor on tumor cells. Collectively, our findings reveal that Th2 cell–macrophage crosstalk leads to IL-24–mediated tumor cell death, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy to tackle breast cancer.">

To identify the “naïve” population from which this “memory” population derives, we performed phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional profiling of NK cell subsets. We identified immature precursors to the Adaptive NK cells that are equally present in both CMV+ and CMV- individuals, resolved an Adaptive transcriptional state distinct from most mature NK cells and sharing a common gene program with the immature CD56bright population, and demonstrated retention of proliferative capacity and acquisition of superior IFNγ production in the Adaptive population. Furthermore, we distinguish the CD56bright and Adaptive NK populations by expression of the transcription factor CXXC5, positioning these memory NK cells at the inflection point between innate and adaptive lymphocytes.">

        <tr id="Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease characterized by reversible airflow limitation and airway hyperresponsiveness, which requires long‐term drug treatment and management. It is very important to study the etiology and pathogenesis of asthma for clinical asthma prevention and treatment. In this study, to understand the correlation between C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) in bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) and antigen presentation of asthma dendritic cells (DCs), an in vitro model of BMDCs was constructed for RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq). The changes of CXCL14 in BMDCs after house dust mites (HDM) stimulation were evaluated. Finally, evaluated the inflammation of the lung tissue in mice, and the expression of costimulatory molecules on the DCs surface in the lung tissue was analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that CXCL14 was upregulated in BMDCs after HDM stimulation, and its function was related to signal molecule interaction and the immune system. The expression of CXCL14 was increased in the HDM‐induced allergic asthma model. Knockdown of CXCL14 reduced the expression of costimulatory molecules CD86, CD80, and major histocompatibility complex II on the surface of DCs in the lung tissue of mice, induced immune tolerance, and reduced lung inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factor levels, providing new ideas and theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of bronchial asthma.">

        <tr id="Introduction Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a master regulator of allergic inflammation against pathogens at barrier surfaces of the lung, skin, and gut. However, aberrant TSLP activity is implicated in various allergic, chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases and cancers. Biologics drugs neutralizing excess TSLP activity represented by tezepelumab have been approved for severe asthma and are being evaluated for the treatments of other TSLP-mediated diseases. Methods and results In this study, we discovered and characterized a novel humanized anti-TSLP antibody TAVO101 with high binding affinity to human TSLP, which blocks TSLP binding to its receptor complexes on cell surface. TAVO101 showed potent neutralization of TSLP activities in the TSLP-driven STAT5 reporter assay and cell proliferation assay. Results from ex vivo studies showed that TAVO101 neutralized TSLP-mediated CCL17 release from primary human CD1c+ dendritic cells and proliferation of activated CD4+ T cells. In addition, TAVO101 showed strong efficacy in both TSLP/OVA-induced asthma and imiquimod induced psoriasis models in hTSLP/hTSLPR double knock-in mice. We further conducted Fc engineering to optimize TAVO101 antibody with reduced affinity to Fcγ receptors and C1q protein but with increased affinity to FcRn receptor for half-life extension. Discussion By recognizing a different epitope, similarly potent neutralization of TSLP activities, and longer circulating half-life than tezepelumab, novel anti-TSLP antibody TAVO101 offers a potential best-in class therapeutics for various TSLP-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are innate immune cells that exert far reaching influence over the tumor microenvironment (TME). Depending on cues within the local environment, TAMs may promote tumor angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion and immunosuppression, or, alternatively, inhibit tumor progression via neoantigen presentation, tumoricidal reactive oxygen species generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Therefore, TAMs have a pivotal role in determining tumor progression and response to therapy. TAM phenotypes are driven by cytokines and physical cues produced by tumor cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, immune cells, and other cells within the TME. Research has shown that TAMs can be primed by environmental stimuli, adding another layer of complexity to the environmental context that determines TAM phenotype. Innate priming is a functional consequence of metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of innate cells by a primary stimulant, resulting in altered cellular response to future secondary stimulation. Innate priming offers a novel target for development of cancer immunotherapy and improved prognosis of disease, but also raises the risk of exacerbating existing inflammatory pathologies. This review will discuss the mechanisms underlying innate priming including metabolic and epigenetic modification, its relevance to TAMs and tumor progression, and possible clinical implications for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Aging is tightly associated with reduced immune protection but increased risk of autoimmunity and inflammatory conditions. Regulatory T cells are one of the key cells to maintaining immune homeostasis. The age-dependent changes in CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been well documented. However, the nonredundant Foxp3-CD8+ Tregs were never examined in the context of aging. This study first established clear distinctions between phenotypically overlapping CD8+ Tregs and virtual memory T cells. Then, we elucidated the dynamics of CD8+ Tregs across the lifespan in mice and further extended our investigation to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In mice, we discovered a bi-phasic dynamic shift in the frequency of CD8+CD44hiCD122hiLy49+ Tregs, with a steady increase in young adults and a notable peak in middle age followed by a decline in older mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that mouse CD8+ Tregs upregulated a selected set of natural killer (NK) cell-associated genes, including NKG2D, with age. Importantly, NKG2D might negatively regulate CD8+ Tregs. Additionally, by analyzing a scRNA-seq dataset of human PBMC, we found a distinct CD8+ Treg-like subset (Cluster 10) with comparable age-dependent frequency changes and gene expression, suggesting a conserved aging pattern in CD8+ Treg across mice and humans. In summary, our findings highlight the importance of CD8+ Tregs in immune regulation and aging.">

The effect of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which detects viral RNA to initiate antiviral and proinflammatory responses to IAV, on lung function during peak infection and in the resolution phase is not fully understood. Using wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice, we found that IAV infection induced airway dysfunction in both genotypes, although in TLR7 KO mice, this dysfunction manifested later, did not affect lung tissue elastance and damping, and was associated with a different immune phenotype. A positive correlation was found between lung dysfunction and the infiltration of neutrophils and Ly6Clo patrolling monocytes at day 7 post-infection. Conversely, in TLR7 KO mice, eosinophil and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were associated with airway hyperactivity at day 14. IL-5 expression was higher in the airways of IAV-infected TLR7 KO mice, suggesting an enhanced Th2 response due to TLR7 deficiency. This study highlights an underappreciated duality of TLR7 in IAV disease: promoting inflammation-driven lung dysfunction during the acute infection but suppressing eosinophilic and CD8+ T cell-dependent hyperresponsiveness during disease resolution.">

 Immunotherapies are a promising emerging pillar of cancer treatment, but they still face many barriers due to the immunosuppressive nature of cancer. Cancer immunotherapy relies on the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses. One way of stimulating such responses, known as immunogenic cell death (ICD), involves the release of tumour-associated antigens and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These DAMPs function to recruit and activate innate immune cells, including antigen-presenting cells (APCs), through engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), subsequently leading to production of the pro-inflammatory Signal 3 cytokines required for activation of adaptive immune cells (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs] and natural killer [NK] cells). The tyrosine kinase Fes suppresses innate immune responses in APCs by inhibiting components of the PRR signaling cascade. In non-cancer contexts, the negative regulation of APCs by Fes may guard against consequences of overactive innate immunity, including endotoxic shock or autoimmune disease. However, this same inhibitory effect on APC function may also serve as a checkpoint to successful anti-cancer immunotherapy, by obstructing efficient priming of cancer specific CTLs by APCs. Therefore, by inhibiting Fes, we hypothesize there will be greater Signal 3 cytokine production, resulting in greater CTL activation, and therefore improved tumor control. Using bone marrow derived APCs, including macrophages (BMDMs) and dendritic cells (BMDCs), from wildtype (WT) or Fes knockout (fes-/-) mice, we have shown through both Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis, that PRR signal transduction cascades are suppressed by Fes and increase levels of Signal 3 cytokines produced by fes-/- APCs. This includes higher levels of cell associated IL-12 in fes-/- APCs. Using syngeneic orthotopic mouse engraftment models of triple negative breast cancer (EO771) and melanoma (B16-F10) we showed that treatment with doxorubicin (which induces ICD) or anti-PD-1 (immune checkpoint inhibitor) plus doxorubicin controls tumor growth and prolongs survival to a greater extent in fes-/- mice. Immunophenotyping of tumors and spleens from these mice showed higher levels of activated CTLs and skewing of macrophages to a M1 state in fes-/- mice. SIINFEKL peptide loaded-BMDM/BMDCs from fes-/- mice were also more effective at priming CTLs from OT-1 mice (which express a T cell receptor that recognizes the SIINFEKL peptide) in antigen cross-presentation co-culture assays. These results implicate Fes as a potential novel immune checkpoint whose inhibition may enhance anti-cancer immunotherapy by suppressing its role in dampening inflammatory Signal 3 cytokine production by APCs. I will present recent data exploring the role of Fes in regulating the expression and trafficking of IL-12 in APCs to better understand the molecular basis of improved CTL activation by fes-/- APCs.

        <tr id="Background. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of malignant blood diseases with a high risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. One treatment approach is to target immune checkpoints (ICs) that are overexpressed on tumor cells. To develop these drugs, relevant models are needed for highthroughput screening and study of these biologically active substances, since traditionally used models (mouse and patient biomaterials) are difficult to access, financially and laborintensive, and are characterized by poorly reproducible results.Aim. To develop a model based on a human myeloid cell line with increased expression of L1 and TIM3 to study the activity of ICs inhibitors, the presence of which in the tumor microenvironment in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia was associated with a high risk and worse prognosis.Materials and methods. Initial testing of the L1 and TIM3 basal expression level was carried out on cell lines: TH1, HL60, OCIAML2, OCIAML5, KG1, MonoMac1. Induction of IC expression was carried out using interferon γ. Analysis of marker expression was carried out 24 hours after induction of ICs expression and addition of MK2206 using flow cytometry.Results. Basal expression of the studied ICs receptors was absent in all of them, except for KG1; TIM3 was present in 88.4 ± 7.1 % of cells, and L1 – in 88 ± 8.5 %. The addition of interferon γ at a concentration of 50 ng/mL to the MonoMac1 culture led to a significant increase in the proportion of TIM3 and L1 expressing cells (53.3 ± 12.2 and 97.3 ± 1.1 % respectively, compared to 0.1 ± 0.1 and 0.1 ± 0.1 % without interferon γ), and for TH1 only L1 expression (87.5 ± 20 %, control 0.1 ± 0.1 %) was observed at the concentration of interferon γ in a medium of 50 ng/mL, while the proportion of cells expressing TIM3 was 6.9 ± 10 % (control 0.1 ± 0.1 %).Conclusion. The KG1 line, which constantly expresses significant levels of target ICs, as well as TH1 and MonoMac1, which are induced by 50 ng/mL interferon γ, were selected as a model with increased L1 and TIM3 expression based on a human myeloid cell line. The model efficiency was confirmed by the rational response to the IC pathway inhibitor.">

        <tr id="Introduction Anandamide (AEA) is an endocannabinoid that has recently been recognized as a regulator of various inflammatory diseases as well as cancer. While AEA was thought to predominantly engage cannabinoid (CB) receptors, recent findings suggest that, given its protective anti-inflammatory role in pathological conditions, anandamide may engage not only CB receptors. Methods In this study, we studied the role of exogenous AEA in a mouse AirPouch model of acute inflammation by examining immune cell infiltrates by flow cytometry. Human primary immune cells were used to validate findings towards immune cell activation and migration by flow cytometry and bead-based ELISA. Results We found that AEA decreases the acute infiltration of myeloid cells including granulocytes and monocytes into the inflamed area, but unexpectedly increases the number of T cells at the site of inflammation. This was related to AEA signaling through nuclear receptor subfamily 4A (NR4A) transcription factors rather than CB receptors. Exploring regulatory mechanisms in the human system, we found that AEA broadly inhibits the migratory capacity of immune cells, arguing for blocked emigration of T cells from the inflamed tissue. Taking a closer look at the impact of AEA on T cells revealed that AEA profoundly alters the activation and exhaustion status of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, thereby strongly inhibiting TH17 responses, while not altering TH1 differentiation. Discussion These data suggest that AEA has the potential to block chronic inflammation without influencing crucial anti-viral and anti-microbial immune defense mechanisms, and may therefore be an attractive molecule to interfere with the establishment of chronic inflammation.">

This article provides step-by- step procedure description and results based on in vivo studies on murine lung tissue, cell of interest isolation with dual protocols for flow cytometry method as well as IL-33 impact in dynamics. The newly described innate lymphoid cells of group 2 (ILC2) play an important role in type 2 immune reactions, epithelial repair in mucosal tissue and metabolic homeostasis. ILC2 releases large amounts of type 2 cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13, which stimulate type 2 immunity, such as protection against worms. However, without strict regulation, the level of ILC2 can cause undesirable type 2 immune pathologies, including allergic inflammation of the respiratory tract, hypersensitivity of the respiratory tract and atopic dermatitis. Viral infections of the respiratory tract, which are typical triggers of type 1 immune reactions, often lead to type 2 pulmonary immune pathologies, such as asthma and its exacerbations. Interestingly, pulmonary virus infections induce the release of IL-33 with subsequent induction of ILC2-mediated type 2 pulmonary immunopathology, which is independent of the adaptive immune system.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are complex conditions characterized by immune-mediated tissue damage and chronic inflammation. Protease-activated receptor 2 (Par2) has been implicated in these diseases, exhibiting dual roles that complicate its therapeutic potential. This review examines the perplexing functions of Par2, which promotes inflammation through immune cell activation while facilitating tissue healing in damaged organs. By analyzing findings across diverse autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease, we highlight how the context and location of Par2 activation determine its effects. Recent studies from our laboratory have resolved some of these contradictions by distinguishing Par2’s immune-mediated inflammatory roles from its tissue-reparative functions. These insights pave the way for context-specific therapeutic strategies, such as selective Par2 modulators, that can mitigate inflammation while enhancing tissue repair. However, achieving such precision in modulation remains a significant challenge, necessitating further research into Par2’s signaling pathways. This review underscores Par2’s complexity and its transformative potential in autoimmune disease management, offering a nuanced perspective on its duality and therapeutic implications.">

 The interleukin (IL)-23 signaling is a vital pathway in Crohn’s disease (CD). IL-23 activates T-helper (Th) 17 cells, IL-17-secreting CD8 T (Tc)17 cells, γδ T cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) to secrete inflammatory cytokines including IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Risankizumab is the first selective IL-23 antagonist approved for moderate-to-severe CD; however, no biomarker currently exists to predict response to this medication. Here, we characterized the phenotypes of IL-23-activated cells that predict response to risankizumab in CD patients.



 Adult patients with active ileal/colonic CD were included (n = 28). Blood samples were collected before and after initiation of risankizumab. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and cryopreserved for batch analysis. After stimulation with IL-23, PBMCs were stained using a pre-optimized and validated antibody panel for 37 lineage markers and cytokines for CyTOF. Cell clusters were resolved using UMAP (Figure 1), opt-SNE and FlowJo. Patients’ responses were evaluated 12-40 weeks after initiation of risankizumab based on clinical symptoms (e.g., CDAI) and endoscopic/radiographic assessment.



 Among the IL-23-activated cells, increased frequency of NKT cells was identified in the peripheral blood of non-responders before initiation of risankizumab (not shown). In pre-risankizumab PBMCs, we identified significantly elevated TNF-α in Th17 cells, Tc17 cells, NKT cells, and MAIT cells in non-responders vs. responders (Figure 2A). Similarly, in PBMCs 4 weeks after 1st risankizumab infusion, Tc17 cells, γδ T cells, NKT cells, and MAIT cells in non-responders produced significantly more TNF-α compared to those cells from responders. In addition, we observed increased IL-17A in multiple IL-23-activated cells in non-responders 4 weeks after starting risankizumab (Figure 2B). Peripheral and mucosal IL-23-activated cells from later non-responders before and 4 weeks after treatment spontaneously secreted TNF-α and IL-17A without stimulation. A similar correlation between therapeutic response and expression of TNF-α or IL-17A was not observed in ustekinumab, an anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody (not shown).



 CyTOF of patients’ PBMCs before and after starting risankizumab revealed previously unknown molecular signatures, especially augmented TNF-a production in multiple IL-23-activated cells, which predict non-response to risankizumab in CD patients. Those findings identified a novel mechanism of anti-IL-23 resistance, may help identify response biomarkers for IL-23 antagonists and provide a rationale for anti-IL-23/anti-TNF combination therapy in a subset of patients with refractory CD.

        <tr id="The exclusion of immune cells from the tumor can limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway plays a crucial role in priming adaptive anti-tumor immunity through the production of type I interferons (IFNs), facilitating the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the function of T cells. Although the increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) upon STING activation is favorable for amplifying the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and realizing combination therapy, the penetration barrier remains a major obstacle. Herein, we fabricated a smart-responsive nanosystem (B&V@ZB-MCL) by integrating the extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading drug losartan with a STING agonist (Vadimezan, abbreviated to Vad) and a PD-L1 inhibitor (BMS-1). Losartan was first released in the acidic tumor microenvironment to overcome the physical barrier, enhancing the penetration of immunotherapeutic components. Under the triggering of 1O2 generated by a photosensitizer (Ce6), the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive degradation of the nanocore ensured the site-directed release of Vad and BMS-1. The released Vad and damaged tumor DNA activated immune responses through the cGAS-STING pathway, while the elevated expression level of PD-L1 promoted the anti-tumor effect of BMS-1. Significant degradation of collagen fibers, restoration of immune effector cells, and lower tumor volume were observed in this integrated triple drug sequential therapy, which provides a promising prospect for TNBC treatment.">

        <tr id="The term cancer immunoediting describes the dual role by which the immune system can suppress and promote tumour growth and is divided into three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. The role of NK cells has mainly been attributed to the elimination phase. Here we show that NK cells play a role in all three phases of cancer immunoediting. Extended co-culturing of DNA barcoded mouse BCR/ABLp185+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) cells with NK cells allowed for a quantitative measure of NK cell-mediated immunoediting. Although most tumour cell clones were efficiently eliminated by NK cells, a certain fraction of tumour cells harboured an intrinsic primary resistance. Furthermore, DNA barcoding revealed tumour cell clones with secondary resistance, which stochastically acquired resistance to NK cells. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity put a selective pressure on B-ALL cells, which led to an outgrowth of primary and secondary resistant tumour cell clones, which were characterised by an IFN-γ signature. Besides well-known regulators of immune evasion, our analysis of NK cell-resistant tumour cells revealed the upregulation of genes, including Ly6a, which we found to promote leukaemic-cell resistance to NK cells. Translation of our findings to the human system showed that high expression of LY6E on tumour cells impaired their physical interaction with NK cells and led to worse prognosis in leukaemia patients. Our results demonstrate that tumour cells are actively edited by NK cells during the equilibrium phase and use different avenues to escape NK cell-mediated eradication.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is more effective in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) than other therapies, but a high proportion of patients relapse after CAR-T cell therapy owing to antigen escape, limited persistence of CAR-T cells, and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. CAR-T cell exhaustion is a major cause of relapse. Epigenetic modifications can regulate T cell activation, maturation and depletion; they can be applied to reduce T cell depletion, improve infiltration, and promote memory phenotype formation to reduce relapse after CAR-T cell therapy.We propose to develop and validate in vitro the function of novel CAR-T cells for the treatment of DLBCL, which simultaneously express an anti-CD19 CAR with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) short hairpin (sh)RNA to prevent depletion and prolong the survival of CAR-T cells.We designed an shRNA sequence targeting LSD1 mRNA, and created a vector with the following elements: the U6 promoter driving expression of the LSD1 shRNA sequence, the EF1a promoter driving a second-generation anti-CD19 CAR sequence encoding an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment (FMC63), the CD8 hinge and transmembrane structural domains, the CD28 co-stimulatory structural domain, and the CD3ζ-activating structural domain. The MFG-LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR plasmid was first constructed, then packaged in retroviral vectors and transduced into human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived T cells to generate the corresponding CAR-T cells. We examined by flow cytometry the efficiency of two CAR-T cells in killing U-2932 cells (a human DLBCL line) upon co-culture with RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. We analyzed Ki-67 staining of the CAR-T cells by flow cytometry on days 0, 5, and 10, and counted the cells to assess expansion. We also used flow cytometry to detect the central memory T cell (TCM) proportion.We detected the expression of the CAR in the CAR-T cells by flow cytometry, and observed transduction rates of 31.5% for RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells and 60.7% for LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. The killing efficiency of LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells was significantly higher than that of RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells at the low effector target ratio. We further found that LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells secreted more IFN-γ and granzyme B than RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. CAR-T cells proliferated after U-2932 cell stimulation and were able to sustain proliferation. After stimulation via U-2932 cell co-culture, both RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T and LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T populations had increased proportions of cells with the TCM phenotype, with a higher percentage among LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells.We developed a novel, feasible CD19-LSD1 shRNA CAR-T cell strategy for the treatment of DLBCL. Our in vitro assay results showed that LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells more effectively killed target cells than RNAU6 anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, and developed a higher proportion of TCM phenotype cells. LSD1 shRNA anti-CD19 CAR-T cells may represent a potential treatment for DLBCL.">

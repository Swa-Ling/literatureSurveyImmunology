        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Bats can host viruses of pandemic concern without developing disease. The mechanisms underlying their exceptional resilience to viral infections are largely unresolved, necessitating the development of physiologically relevant and genetically tractable research models. Here, we developed respiratory and intestinal organoids that recapitulated the cellular diversity of the in vivo epithelium present in Rousettus aegyptiacus, the natural reservoir for the highly pathogenic Marburg virus (MARV). In contrast to human counterparts, bat organoids and mucosal tissue exhibited elevated constitutive expression of innate immune effectors, including type I interferon-ε (IFNε) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Upon infection with diverse zoonotic viruses, including MARV, bat organoids strongly induced type I and III IFN responses, which conferred robust antiviral protection. Type III IFNλ3 additionally displayed virus-independent self-amplification, acting as an ISG to enhance antiviral immunity. Our organoid platform reveals key features of bat epithelial antiviral immunity that may inform therapeutic strategies for viral disease resilience.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells play an important role in mediating long-lasting adaptive immune responses to viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2. In the context of the latter, much of our current knowledge stems from studies in vaccinated individuals or repeatedly infected individuals. However, limited knowledge is available on these responses in fully naive individuals in German communities. We performed immunophenotyping of a previously naive SARS-CoV-2 cohort in convalescent individuals after asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19. The samples were collected median 250 days post infection during the first wave of the COVID pandemic in Germany (March – May 2020). In this cohort of 174 individuals, we phenotyped different leukocyte cell populations in peripheral blood (B, T and Natural Killer cells). We then assessed the serostatus against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike subunit (S1) with its receptor binding domain (RBD), as these are important correlates of protection, by testing for presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We also measured IgG antibody responses against the N antigen of the common cold coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, to determine possible cross-reactivity. In a subset of the cohort (n = 76), we performed intracellular staining assays (ICS) after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens. Key findings are significant differences in frequency of CD4+ memory T cell populations, notably CD4+ TEM and CD4+ TEMRA cells, between the group of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and the control group. These differences correlated with cytokine production (TNFα, IFNγ) after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides, indicating a specific T cell immune response. In conclusion, a clear memory T cell and humoral response can be detected up to 250 days post mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Our results underline findings reported by others indicating a lasting cellular immune response even in a population which previously had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Peripheral surgery evokes neuroimmune activation in the central nervous system and modulates immune cell polarization in the ischemic brain. However, the phenotypic change of microglia and myeloid cells within post-surgical ischemic brain tissue remain poorly defined. Using an integrated approach that combines single-cell RNA sequencing with comprehensive biological analysis in a perioperative ischemic stroke (PIS) model, we identified a distinct Spp1-positive macrophage/microglia (Spp1+ Mac/MG) subgroup that exhibit enriched anti-inflammatory pathways with distinct lipid metabolic reprogrammed profile. Moreover, using immunofluorescence staining, we identified the expression of Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) in Spp1+F4/80+ cells and Spp1+Iba-1+ cells. Intraperitoneal administration of semaglutide, a GLP1R agonist clinically approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulted in a significant reduction of cerebral infarct volume in PIS mice compared to that in ischemic stroke (IS) mice. Meanwhile, semaglutide treatment also increased the proportion of Spp1+Edu+Iba-1+ cells 3 days after PIS. Using high-parameter flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining and RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that semaglutide treatment significantly attenuated the expression of neuroinflammatory markers in mice following PIS. We also found that semaglutide treatment significantly ameliorated sensorimotor dysfunction up to 3 days after PIS in mice. Our current finding reveal a novel protective Spp1+Mac/MG subset after PIS and demonstrated that it can be upregulated by semaglutide. We propose that targeting Spp1+Mac/MG subsets using semaglutide could serve as a promising strategy to attenuate the exacerbated neuroinflammation in PIS.

        <tr id="Abstract Proliferation of microglia represents a physiological process, which is accelerated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). The effect of such neurodegeneration-associated microglial proliferation on function and disease progression remains unclear. Here, we show that proliferation results in profound alterations of cellular function by providing evidence that newly proliferated microglia show impaired beta-amyloid clearance in vivo. Through sorting of proliferating microglia of APP/PS1 mice and subsequent transcriptome analysis, we define unique proliferation-associated transcriptomic signatures that change with age and beta-amyloid accumulation and are characterized by enrichment of immune system-related pathways. Of note, we identify the DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked (DDX3X) as a key molecule to modulate microglia activation and cytokine secretion and it is expressed in the AD brain. Together, these results argue for a novel concept by which phenotypic and functional microglial changes occur longitudinally as a response to accelerated proliferation in a neurodegenerative environment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic (‘phase’) markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1) and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1 and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signalling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69 and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells towards persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells. Spectral flow cytometry in an independent MS cohort revealed distinct memory and effector T cell subsets, indicating unique CSF signatures in MS. This study underscores the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of CD4+ T cells detectable by spectral flow cytometry, enhancing diagnostic resolution of CSF cells and informing more precise therapeutic strategies for MS.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels did not decline in any cohort following repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, nor did the expression of exhaustion markers on spike-specific or total T cells increase. T cell production of multiple cytokines (i.e. polyfunctionality) in response to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 did not decline in any cohort following repeated vaccination. None of the cohorts displayed elevated levels of terminally differentiated T cells following multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Thus, repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was not associated with increased T cell exhaustion in older frail adults, immunosuppressed individuals, or healthy adults.">

In this study, we recruited 19 hospitalized patients with immune disorders (ImCo) and 4 immunocompetent controls (ICC) with COVID-19. We evaluated their serological, humoral, and cellular immune responses at <30 days and >90 days post-symptom onset. ICC patients showed robust B and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, indicated by detectable antibody levels, memory antibody-secreting cells (mASCs) towards the spike protein and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. ImCo patients showed impaired immune responses, with lower levels of B cell responses. Further subdivision of the ImCo patients demonstrates that solid organ transplant (SOT) patients generated B cell responses similar to ICC patients, whereas the other ImCo patients, including patients with hematological malignancies and anti-CD20 therapy, did not. Absolute T cell numbers and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were low in the ImCo patients at <30 days but increased at later time points. Our findings suggest that even when B cell responses were reduced, patients could present a T cell response, suggesting a more successful line of passive immunization for immunocompromised individuals focusing on boosting T cell responses.">

        <tr id="Microglia are resident innate immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that provides anti-microbial protection but also promote neuroinflammation. BRD4 is a chromatin reader that binds to acetylated histones and directs transcription of numerous genes. However, it is unknown whether and how BRD4 regulates microglia function. We addressed the role of microglia and BRD4 in a neuroinflammatory disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. It was reported earlier that in EAE, upon initial T cell activation in the peripheral lymphoid organs, CD4+ T cells migrate to CNS and are reactivated by resident or migratory antigen presenting cells resulting in full manifestation of EAE (Rossi and Constantin, Front Immunol 7:506, 2016), (Plastini et al., Front Cell Neurosci 14:269, 2020). Using conditional deletion of Brd4 in CD4 T cells, we reveal that BRD4 regulates T helper cell differentiation and promotes T cell migration to CNS resulting in EAE. It remained unclear whether resident microglia are capable of reactivating migrating T cells to the CNS and if BRD4 plays a role in the process. To determine the role of microglial BRD4 in EAE, we constructed conditional knockout mice lacking Brd4 (Brd4cKO) in microglia. RNA-seq analysis showed that Brd4 deletion led to the downregulation of many microglia genes in both naive and EAE conditions. Consequently, Brd4cKO mice had markedly reduced EAE pathology, namely reduced paralysis, absence of axonal demyelination and inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines. In vehicle treated mice (vehicle) abundant number of T cells were found to be near microglia that may lead to T cell- microglia interaction and T cell reactivation. In contrast, the number of T cells detected in the CNS of Brd4cKO mice was much fewer. This may lead to reduced T cell- microglia interaction, failure of T cells to get reactivated and hence failed to achieve full manifestation of EAE. These results demonstrate that microglia are critically involved in EAE disease progression for which BRD4 is essential. In summary, BRD4 directs transcription of genes defining microglia function. By so doing BRD4 promotes demyelination and neuroinflammation to exacerbate EAE.

Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS.

        <tr id="Long COVID is a heterogeneous condition characterized by a wide range of symptoms that persist for 90 days or more following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Now more than five years out from the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the mechanisms driving Long COVID are just beginning to be elucidated. Adipose tissue has been proposed as a potential reservoir for viral persistence and tissue dysfunction contributing to symptomology seen in Long COVID. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from two cohorts: participants with subacute COVID-19 (28–89 days post-infection) compared to pre-pandemic controls, and participants with Long COVID compared to those with those classified as “indeterminate” based on the RECOVER-Adult Long COVID Research Index (12-47 months post-infection). We found no evidence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in adipose tissue in any participant. SAT from participants with subacute COVID-19 displayed significant transcriptional remodeling, including depleted immune activation pathways and upregulated Hox genes and integrin interactions, suggesting resident immune cell exhaustion and perturbations in tissue function. However, no consistent changes in gene expression were observed between Long COVID samples and samples from indeterminant participants. Thus, SAT may contribute to inflammatory dysregulation following COVID-19, but does not appear to play a clear role in Long COVID pathophysiology. Further research is needed to clarify the role of adipose tissue in COVID-19 recovery.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 was the causing agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive economic losses. Although there are already several vaccines licensed, as novel variants develop, understanding the immune response induced by vaccination and natural infection is key for the development of future vaccines. Methods: In this study, we have used flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing to assess the longitudinal CD8+ T-cell response against natural infection and vaccination in convalescent and vaccinated individuals, from early activation to immune memory establishment. Moreover, we have characterized the T-cell receptor clonality and diversity at different stages post-infection and post-vaccination. Results: We have found no significant differences in CD8+ T-cell activation during the first three weeks post-infection compared to the first three weeks after first vaccination. Conversely, natural infection resulted in sustained high levels of T-cell activation at four weeks post-infection, a point in which we observed a decline in T-cell activation post-vaccination despite boosting with a second vaccination shot. Moreover, additional vaccination did not result in enhanced T-cell activation. Of note, we have observed variations in the memory subset structure at every stage of disease and vaccination. Overall, both infection and immunization induced a highly diverse T-cell receptor repertoire, which was observed both between study groups and between patients inside a given group. Conclusions: These data contribute to expand our knowledge about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and call for additional strategies to enhance T-cell responses by booster immunization.">

        <tr id="There is little understanding of how aging serves as the strongest risk factor for several neurogenerative diseases. Specific neural cell types, such as microglia, undergo age-related maladaptive changes, including increased inflammation, impaired debris clearance, and cellular senescence, yet specific mediators that regulate these processes remain unclear. The aged brain is rejuvenated by youth-associated plasma factors, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), which we have shown acts on the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate synaptic plasticity. Given emerging roles for microglia in these processes, we examined the impact of TIMP2 on microglial function. We show that TIMP2 deletion exacerbates microglial phenotypes associated with aging, including transcriptomic changes in cell activation, increased microgliosis, and increased levels of stress and inflammatory proteins measured in the brain extracellular space by in vivo microdialysis. Deleting specific cellular pools of TIMP2 in vivo increased microglial activation and altered myelin phagocytosis. Treating aged mice with TIMP2 reversed several phenotypes observed in our deletion models, resulting in decreased microglial activation, reduced proportions of proinflammatory microglia, and enhanced phagocytosis of physiological substrates. Our results identify TIMP2 as a key modulator of age-associated microglia dysfunction. Harnessing its activity may mitigate detrimental effects of age-associated insults on microglia function.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aims This study aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of microglia and their role in recruiting and activating CD8+ T cells in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Methods C57BL/6J mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) to induce ECM. Morphology and distribution of microglia were assessed via immunofluorescence (IF) staining and electron microscopy. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing (scRNA‐seq) analyzed the activation characteristics of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and the transcriptional heterogeneity of microglia in ECM. In vitro, ECM‐associated microglia were induced by TNFα, IFNγ, and parasite‐infected red blood cells (pRBCs). The interaction between microglia and CD8+ T cells was explored in co‐culture systems through transwell assay, adhesion assay, and cytotoxicity test. Results In vivo, microglia were aggregated in the brainstem and olfactory bulb in the ECM brain, regions that exhibited more severe pathological injury. The transcriptional characteristics of ECM microglia distinguished from physiological microglia and exhibit morphological heterogeneity in the ECM brain. Infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the ECM brainstem exhibit sustained activation characteristics associated with microglia interaction. Based on subcluster analysis, a unique subtype of ECM‐associated microglia was identified, characterized by CXCL10highTNFαhighKi67+. These microglia mediated the recruitment and sustained activation of CD8+ T cells through persistent interactions in co‐culture systems. Conclusions Our study identified an ECM‐associated microglia subtype and explored its interaction with CD8+ T cells, which deepened the understanding of the multifaceted role of microglia in the pathogenesis of CM neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Recent documented infection with an endemic coronavirus (eCoV) is associated with less severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet the immune mechanism behind this protection has not been fully explored. We measured both antibody and T-cell responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals, classified into two groups: those with or without presumed recent eCoV infections. There was no difference in neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens between the two groups. SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals with recent presumed eCoV infection, however, had higher and significantly correlated levels of Fc receptor (FcR)-binding antibodies against eCoV spikes (S) and SARS-CoV-2 S2. Recent eCoV infection boosts cross-reactive antibodies that can mediate Fc effector functions, and this may play a role in the observed heterotypic immune protection against severe COVID-19. IMPORTANCE With the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses, it is important to understand how the immune system may protect against disease from future coronavirus outbreaks. We investigated the adaptive immune responses elicited from a “common cold” eCoV and measured the cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals classified as having or not having a recent eCoV infection. Although both groups had similar cross-reactive T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses, individuals with a recent eCoV infection had higher antibody levels capable of Fc receptor binding. Antibodies with enhanced Fc receptor binding could mediate the killing of virally infected cells through mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which may reduce the severity of COVID-19. Antibodies capable of mediating Fc effector functions may be critical for therapies and vaccines against future pathogenic coronavirus outbreaks.

        <tr id="Given the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the historical emergence of other highly transmissible coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, in vivo coronavirus research remains crucial even when the COVID-19 pandemic is receding. Due to restricted tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses for mouse cells, model systems of infection rely on transgenic expression of the entry receptor human ACE2 (hACE2). Available hACE2 transgenic models using the Krt18 promotor express the receptor across multiple cell types and organ systems, leading to multiple disease features including pneumonia, vascular compromise and neuro-inflammation, that reflect the multi-organ nature of COVID-19. To disentangle the role of cell tropism in driving the clinical manifestations of the disease, we generated two new transgenic mouse models, Sftpa1-hACE2 and Cdh5-hACE2 transgenic mice, with hACE2 restricted to lung epithelium or endothelial cells respectively. In Sftpa1-hACE2 mice, with high expression of the hACE2 receptor in lung alveolar type 2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection led to rapidly progressing disease, characterised by a strong neutrophilic innate immune response in the lung, followed by viral neuro-invasion and early death. Krt18-hACE2 mice additionally recruited various dendritic cell subsets and gradually developed adaptive immunity. In Cdh5-hACE2 Tg mice with exclusive endothelial tropism of the virus, viral inoculation via the lung or systemic circulation did not lead to viral propagation or disease manifestations, despite endothelial expression of hACE2 in the lung. These results suggest that tropism for alveolar epithelial cells increases disease severity, while endothelial cell tropism per se does not drive the vascular consequences often seen in COVID-19 patients. Our new transgenic mouse models will be helpful to dissect how cell tropism contributes to the clinical manifestations of coronavirus infection.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure, hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression (HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort, and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular complications are a hallmark of Post-Acute Sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC), yet the mechanisms driving persistent cardiac dysfunction remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence implicates mitochondrial dysfunction in immune cells as a key contributor. This study investigated whether CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients exhibit bioenergetic impairment, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, and defective oxidative stress adaptation, which may underlie cardiovascular symptoms in PASC. CD14++ monocytes were isolated from 14 long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, angina) and 10 age-matched controls with similar cardiovascular risk profiles. Mitochondrial function was assessed using a Seahorse Agilent Analyzer under basal conditions and after oxidative stress induction with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured via Tetramethylrhodamine Ethyl Ester (TMRE) assay, mtDNA integrity via qPCR, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dynamics via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Parallel experiments exposed healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to evaluate direct viral effects. CD14++ monocytes from long COVID patients with cardiovascular symptoms (n = 14) exhibited profound mitochondrial dysfunction compared to age-matched controls (n = 10). Under oxidative stress induced by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), long COVID monocytes failed to upregulate basal respiration (9.5 vs. 30.4 pmol/min in controls, p = 0.0043), showed a 65% reduction in maximal respiration (p = 0.4035, ns) and demonstrated a 70% loss of spare respiratory capacity (p = 0.4143, ns) with significantly impaired adaptation to BSO challenge (long COVID + BSO: 9.9 vs. control + BSO: 54 pmol/min, p = 0.0091). Proton leak, a protective mechanism against ROS overproduction, was blunted in long COVID monocytes (3-fold vs. 13-fold elevation in controls, p = 0.0294). Paradoxically, long COVID monocytes showed reduced ROS accumulation after BSO treatment (6% decrease vs. 1.2-fold increase in controls, p = 0.0015) and elevated mitochondrial membrane potential (157 vs. 113.7 TMRE fluorescence, p = 0.0179), which remained stable under oxidative stress. mtDNA analysis revealed severe depletion (80% reduction, p < 0.001) and region-specific damage, with 75% and 70% reductions in amplification efficiency for regions C and D (p < 0.05), respectively. In contrast, exposure of healthy monocytes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein did not recapitulate these defects, with preserved basal respiration, ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity, though coupling efficiency under oxidative stress was reduced (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID syndrome arises from maladaptive host responses rather than direct viral toxicity, characterized by bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation, and mitochondrial genomic instability. This study identifies persistent mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID monocytes as a critical driver of cardiovascular complications in PASC. Key defects—bioenergetic failure, impaired stress adaptation and mtDNA damage—correlate with clinical symptoms like heart failure and exercise intolerance. The stable elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential and resistance to ROS induction suggest maladaptive remodeling of mitochondrial physiology. These findings position mitochondrial resilience as a therapeutic target, with potential strategies including antioxidants, mtDNA repair agents or metabolic modulators. The dissociation between spike protein exposure and mitochondrial dysfunction highlights the need to explore host-directed mechanisms in PASC pathophysiology. This work advances our understanding of long COVID cardiovascular sequelae and provides a foundation for biomarker development and targeted interventions to mitigate long-term morbidity.">

        <tr id="In neurodegenerative diseases, including prion diseases, astrocytes adopt reactive phenotypes that persist throughout disease progression. While astrocyte reactivity may initially serve as a protective response to prion infection, it transitions into a neurotoxic phenotype that disrupts homeostatic functions and exacerbates disease pathology. The transcription factor Stat3 has been recognized as a master regulator of astrocyte reactivity in neurodegenerative diseases, yet its role in prion disease-associated astrocyte reactive phenotypes remains unexplored. The current study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of Stat3 deletion in reactive astrocytes isolated from prion-infected mice. We demonstrate that Stat3 deletion mitigates the reactive astrocyte phenotype and alleviates their synaptotoxic effects. Stat3-dependent activation of astrocytes was reproduced by co-culturing naïve astrocytes with reactive microglia isolated from prion-infected animals or exposing them to microglia-conditioned media. A cytokine array profiling of 40 molecules revealed partially overlapping inflammatory signatures in reactive microglia and astrocytes, with IL-6 prominently upregulated in both cell types. Notably, IL-6 treatment elevated phosphorylated Stat3 levels in naïve astrocytes and triggered astrocyte reactivity. These findings indicate that the synaptotoxic phenotype of astrocytes in prion diseases can be sustained by reactive microglia and self-reinforced in a cell-autonomous manner. Our work highlights the pivotal role of Stat3 signaling in astrocyte activation and suggests that Stat3 inhibition may suppress the reactive phenotype of astrocytes associated with prion diseases.

        <tr id="Long‐term consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are unknown since recovered individuals can experience symptoms and latent viral reactivation for months. Indeed, acute post‐infection sequelae have also been observed in other respiratory viral infections, including influenza. To characterize post‐COVID‐19 and post‐influenza induced alterations to the cellular immunome, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from patients 3 months after recovery from COVID‐19 (n = 93) or influenza (n = 25), and from pre‐pandemic healthy controls (n = 25). PBMCs were characterized using a 40‐plex mass cytometry panel. Principal component analysis (PCA), classification models, and K‐means clustering were subsequently applied. PCA identified distinct immune profiles between cohorts, with both post‐COVID and post‐flu patients displaying an altered chemokine receptor expression compared to pre‐pandemic healthy controls. These alterations were more prominent in post‐COVID patients since they exhibited highly increased expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR6 by various lymphoid populations, while post‐influenza patients mainly showed a decrease in CCR4 expression by naïve T cells, monocytes, and conventional dendritic cells. Classification models using immunophenotyping data confirm the three groups, while K‐means clustering revealed two subgroups among post‐COVID patients, with younger patients showing more pronounced immune alterations in the chemokine receptor profile, independently of long COVID symptoms. In conclusion, post‐COVID and post‐influenza patients exhibit distinct and unique persistent immune alterations. Understanding these altered immune profiles can guide targeted therapies for post‐COVID syndrome and highlight differences in immune recovery from various respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="ArfGAP with dual PH domain‐containing protein 1 (ADAP1), also known as Centaurin alpha‐1 (CentA1), is an actin‐binding protein highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) that was previously shown to regulate dendritic spine density and plasticity. In the context of disease, ADAP1/CentA1 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, cancer progression, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reactivation. Here, we document that ADAP1/CentA1 is also mechanistically involved in CNS autoimmunity. We show that ADAP1/CentA1 deficient mice exhibit partial resistance to developing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an in vivo disease model recapitulating several features of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. MS is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the CNS characterized by focal immune cell infiltration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Its etiology is still elusive, but genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease risk. By combining detailed immunophenotyping and single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), we demonstrate that ADAP1/CentA1 is necessary for mounting a sufficient autoimmune response for EAE initiation and progression. In particular, the current study highlights that ADAP1/CentA1 expression in the immune system mainly targets the functioning of regulatory T cells (Tregs), monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. In summary, our study defines a novel function for ADAP/CentA1 outside of the CNS and helps elucidate the early molecular events taking place in the peripheral immune system in response to encephalitogenic challenges.">

        <tr id="Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by episodic relapses of neurological symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of patients is key to prevent relapses and irreversible damage to the CNS. However, development of therapies targeting early MS is constrained by the lack of knowledge of early MS disease pathogenesis. In RRMS, nervous tissue damage is induced by CNS-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the early events of CNS infiltration by T cells in RRMS, including their interaction with astrocytes and brain endothelial cells. Using a human in vitro model system and tissue samples obtained from newly diagnosed patients and healthy individuals, we found that CD8+CD20+ T cells could cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier in the absence of inflammation. As CD8+CD20+ T cells are present in the CNS before inflammation and are highly enriched in MS lesions once the disease is initiated, they may be among the first effector cells in RRMS. Our study also showed that CD4+CD20+ T cells can stimulate brain endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and chemokines needed for peripheral immune cells to adhere and migrate through the BBB, and stimulate astrocytes to produce chemokines directing transmigrating cells to the site of inflammation. This suggests that CD4+CD20+ T cells, once migrated to the CNS, strengthens the infiltration of immune cells to the CNS and hereby amplify CNS inflammation. Altogether, this indicates that CD20+ T cells play a role in the early phases of MS-inflammation and therefore are candidate targets for early treatment.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are essential for myelination, remyelination and neuronal metabolic support, but recent evidence suggests they also play active roles in neuroinflammation. This study aimed to identify the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used model for Multiple Sclerosis (MS), using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing. We crossed RiboTag mice with Olig2-Cre mice to obtain strain-specific expression of HA-tagged ribosomal protein Rpl22 in OLCs, enabling the isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA from these cells for sequencing by using HA beads. Compared to controls, 1,556 genes were upregulated and 683 were downregulated in EAE OLCs. Gene enrichment revealed elevated immune-related pathways, including cytokine signaling, interferon responses and antigen presentation, whereas downregulated genes were associated with myelination and neuronal development. Notably, significant expression of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors was detected in OLCs. Further investigations focused on the role of IFNGR and IFNAR in EAE pathogenesis. IFN-γ signaling in OLCs exacerbated EAE pathogenesis by enhancing antigen processing, presentation, and chemokine production (e.g., Ccl2, Ccl7). In contrast, IFN-β signaling appeared less critical. These findings highlight the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE, suggesting OLCs as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation in MS and related disorders.

        <tr id="In this comprehensive review, we delve into the significant body of research on single-cell transcriptomics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to understand neurological diseases with autoimmune, neurodegenerative, infectious, or oncogenic origins. We thoroughly examine all published studies in these areas, with a particular focus on multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. For these diseases, we review findings related to immune cells that infiltrate the brain, based on postmortem brain tissue analyses and include CSF cytometry findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) are increasingly vital tools for studying CSF to understand various aspects of neurological diseases. These advanced techniques allow researchers to explore the etiopathogenesis of these conditions by identifying the roles and interactions of different immune cells. scRNA-seq provides detailed insights into the gene expression profiles of individual cells, revealing how specific cell types contribute to disease progression. scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq enable the study of clonal expansion in T and B cells, respectively, and facilitate antigen prediction, helping to uncover the nature of antigens that trigger adaptive immune responses. By integrating these technologies, scientists can define new therapeutic targets and categorize patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatments. This review highlights the promising advancements and addresses the current limitations of single-cell transcriptomics in the context of CSF and neurological diseases, setting the stage for future breakthroughs.">

Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISGhi) state including: (i) CD14+ monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISGhi naive CD4+ T cells, (iii) ISGhi proliferating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and (iv) ISGhi naive and transitional B cells. We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.">

COVID-19 is associated with both respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, with persistent intestinal pathology contributing to the post-COVID-19 condition. We have previously demonstrated the antiviral activity of autophagy-blocking drugs, such as Berbamine dihydrochloride, against intestinal SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. In addition, the autophagy blockers restored the barrier function of infected intestinal epithelium. In this addendum, using human intestinal organoids, we present evidence for a protective role of intrinsic higher levels of autophagy flux in limiting intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological treatment with Akt inhibitor MK-2206 hydrochloride suppressed viral entry into the intestinal epithelium. This antiviral effect of MK-2206 was shown to be dependent on Synaptosomal-associated protein 29-dependent (SNAP-29)-mediated autophagy flux. Furthermore, extrinsically enhanced autophagy with MK-2206 also prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced intestinal barrier damage. Our findings thus underscore the intricate role of autophagy pathways in the dissemination and pathogenesis of intestinal SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the therapeutic potential of host-directed therapies targeting autophagy to intervene in COVID-19-associated sequelae and improve intestinal health.">

        <tr id="Introduction The chronic nature of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) allows it to coexist with diverse pathologies. However, it remains unclear whether immune alterations associated with LTBI influence COVID-19 coinfection and patient outcomes. This study aims to compare the immune phenotype of patients with LTBI/COVID-19 to those with COVID-19 alone, in order to assess whether latent tuberculosis infection induces significant immune cell alterations. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured and stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) to evaluate cellular distribution and function. Results the LTBI/COVID-19 group exhibited a narrower range of symptoms and required less complex treatment regimens than the COVID-19 group. The cellular evaluation revealed that individuals with COVID-19 displayed a distinct immune profile, characterized by a predominance of monocytes expressing pro-inflammatory and regulatory markers, including TNFR2, HLA-DR+TNFR2, and CD71. While CD4+ T cell subpopulation distribution and function were similar across groups, LTBI/COVID-19 and COVID-19 exhibited similar frequencies of CD8+perforin+ and CD8+Granzime B+ T cells. However, LTBI/COVID-19 displays lower soluble levels of granzyme B and perforin in culture supernatants and perforin, granulysin, and sFas in plasma compared to COVID-19. Notably, CD8+ T cells from LTBI/COVID-19 showed higher antigen-specific degranulation than COVID-19. Moreover, LTBI/COVID-19 individuals predominantly displayed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with highly polarized, compact mitochondria at baseline, which remained unchanged under stimulation. In contrast, COVID-19 had T cells with highly polarized, fragmented mitochondria at baseline, a profile that persisted under stimulation. Conclusion The findings reveal significant alterations in monocytes and T cells of individuals with LTBI/COVID-19, suggesting that co-infection may induce changes in the cellular phenotype and cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with milder COVID-19 symptoms than previous strains. This study analyzed alterations in natural killer (NK) cell-associated immunity dynamics in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases during the Omicron phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients aged ≥16 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized at Tottori University Hospital between January 2022 and May 2022. A total of 27 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 11 and 16 were diagnosed with mild and moderate COVID-19, respectively, based on the Japanese COVID-19 clinical practice guideline. Peripheral blood NK cell subsets and surface markers, including the activating receptor NKG2D and the inhibitory receptor TIGIT, as well as serum levels of 24 immunoregulatory markers, such as cytokines and cytotoxic mediators, were measured at admission and recovery. In addition, to explore immune patterns associated with disease severity, differences in 24 serum markers and soluble UL16-binding protein 2 (sULBP2) at the clinically most symptomatic time point during hospitalization were visualized using a volcano plot and analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Results Patients with mild COVID-19 exhibited expanded subsets of unconventional CD56dimCD16- NK cells with elevated NKG2D expression and lower levels of cytotoxic mediators (granzyme A, granzyme B, and granulysin). In contrast, patients with moderate disease exhibited NK cell exhaustion, characterized by upregulation of TIGIT, along with increased levels of NK cell-associated cytokines and cytotoxic mediators. The volcano plot identified that the patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed that IL-6, IFN-γ, soluble Fas, and CXCL8 were correlated with increased sULBP2. The PCA identified distinct clusters based on disease severity. Conclusions The results of study highlight the differences in NK cell-associated immune alterations between mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. Elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels, along with their correlations with inflammatory mediators, reflects differences in immune response based on disease severity. These findings provide insight into the immune response to infection caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and improve our understanding of its immunological features.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, viral mutations have posed significant challenges in identifying therapeutic targets and developing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Post-translational modifications of genes involved in interferon production and signaling pathways play a crucial role in regulating interferon responses. In this study, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 screening based on adenine base editors to investigate functional amino acids in 1,278 innate immune-related genes. This approach, which converts A-T base pairs into G-C base pairs to probe the functional importance of specific amino acids, allowed us to identify 17 vital factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the candidate genes, genetic knockdown of EHMT2 exhibited the strongest antiviral effect. Further analysis revealed that UNC0638, a selective inhibitor of EHMT2, significantly reduced the endosomal entry of SARS-CoV-2 in pseudovirus assays. The observed inhibitory effect was consistently observed across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Mechanistically, UNC0638 reduced mature cathepsin L (CTSL) levels, impairing the proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and subsequent membrane fusion, a critical step for viral entry. Our findings uncover EHMT2 as a host dependency factor and reveal the antiviral mechanism of EHMT2 inhibitors through CTSL maturation blockade. These results advance the understanding of host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a strategic framework for developing host-targeted antiviral therapies. IMPORTANCE In this study, we demonstrated that knockdown or knockout of EHMT2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection, and inhibitors of EHMT2, including UNC0638, UNC0642, and BIX01294 showed similar restrictive effects. Mechanistically, the EHMT2 inhibitor UNC0638 restricts spike-mediated cell entry by inhibiting the maturation of CTSL, a critical protease required for SARS-CoV-2 entry via the endosomal pathway. Importantly, CTSL is not only essential for SARS-CoV-2 but also plays a key role in the entry of other coronaviruses that utilize similar pathways. Therefore, EHMT2 inhibitors could have broader applications as pan-coronavirus therapeutic agents.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on global health, with nearly 800 million cases reported in the Americas alone. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly variable, with approximately half of all patients experiencing severe symptoms. This variability confounds the complex interplay between immune responses and disease severity. Severe cases are often characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. Over 88% of COVID-19 patients have multiple comorbidities; factors such as age and pre-existing conditions further modulate immune responses and contribute to the severity of the disease. While some studies have reported differences in cytokine profiles between severity groups, larger, well-designed cohorts are needed to clarify these relationships. Natural Killer cells, which are critical for the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, are often impaired and contribute to immune exhaustion. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immune defenses through accessory proteins that inhibit interferon signaling and exacerbate cytokine storms and inflammation. This integrative review aims to synthesize findings from 2020 onward and provide insights into the innate immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and their contributions to disease pathogenesis. Understanding cytokine dynamics, NK cell behaviors, and viral immune evasion strategies is critical for advancing therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="The Global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 was initiated by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In addition to conventional pulmonary lesions, a range of neurological injury symptoms have been identified in clinical practice, but the aetiology of neurological disorders linked to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remains poorly understood. Syrian hamsters, which are highly susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, exhibit a disease phenotype similar to that observed in human COVID‐19 patients. In this study, a hamster model of COVID‐19 infection was used to analyze molecular changes in different tissues at various time points post infection with distinct strains using proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches. Multi‐omics analysis showed that SARS‐COV‐2 infection triggers sustained downregulation of the abundance and phosphorylation levels of neuronal and synapse‐associated proteins in the brain, suggesting that neuronal damage persists even during the recovery period. Additionally, infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 may contribute to the onset of long‐term symptoms of COVID‐19 by impacting energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission pathways. This study provides a comprehensive molecular profile of hamsters infected with different SARS‐CoV‐2 strains in different tissues, offering foundational insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of COVID‐19.">

Surprisingly, we identified a pleocytosis in the CSF, most pronounced in patients with early PD. Single-cell RNAseq revealed increases in CSF-specific microglia-like macrophages expressing JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling signatures in prodromal PD, with a lack of T cell activation in the CSF. The CSF macrophages exhibited similar transcriptional profiles to dural macrophages from human α-synuclein-expressing PD model mice. These findings uncover a myeloid-mediated TNFα inflammatory process in the CNS of patients with prodromal PD, suggesting a novel pathological mechanism in disease etiology.">

It is well established that the pivotal molecular event is a hyperinflammatory response also referred to as a cytokine storm. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine miRNAs which might be predictive for the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). We analyzed blood samples from 210 COVID-19 patients and the control group consisted of 80 healthy individuals. Results revealed the miRNA expression pattern has the potential to predict the severity of COVID-19, reflecting the clinical symptoms of the infection, such as the need for oxygen therapy and concomitant pneumonia. In particular, low expression of miRNAs miR106a-5p, miR17-5p, miR181a-5p, miR191-5p, miR20a-5p and miR451a, especially in the initial phase of the disease, is associated with an unfavorable clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection (admission to the ICU).">

        <tr id="Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may present with a wide clinical spectrum, including extrapulmonary involvement, such as neurological damage. Although the pathogenesis of neurological COVID-19 still remains unclear, some studies have discussed the potential association between tissue injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and/or immune imbalance. These two mechanisms are non-mutually exclusive; however, exacerbated inflammatory-response-induced neurological damage appears to be more aligned with COVID-19 pathogenesis, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication in the CNS remains widely discussed. Herein, we dissect this last issue, highlighting some evidence on SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, as well as discussing gaps that should be addressed for a better understanding of its potential neurotropism, specifically in the CNS. Finally, we propose some deeper reflections on the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic potential.">

        <tr id="Background Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant threat to human health. The virus causes potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS), for which no treatments are available. TBEV infected individuals display a wide spectrum of neuronal disease, the determinants of which are undefined. Changes to host metabolism and virus-induced immunity have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal damage observed in infected individuals. In this study, we evaluated the cytokine, chemokine, and metabolic alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic patients infected with TBEV presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. Our aim was to investigate the host immune and metabolic responses associated with specific TBEV infectious outcomes. Methods CSF samples of patients with meningitis (n = 27) or encephalitis (n = 25) were obtained upon consent from individuals hospitalised with confirmed TBEV infection in Brno. CSF from uninfected control patients was also collected for comparison (n = 12). A multiplex bead-based system was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Untargeted metabolomics followed by bioinformatics and integrative omics were used to profile the levels of metabolites in the CSF. Human motor neurons (hMNs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV-Hypr strain to profile the role(s) of identified metabolites during the virus lifecycle. Virus infection was quantified via plaque assay. Results Significant differences in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-α2, TSLP, IL-1α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-15, and IL-18) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL20, and CXCL11) were detected between neurological-TBEV and control patients. A total of 32 CSF metabolites differed in TBE patients with meningitis and encephalitis. CSF S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP1) and Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) levels were 2.4-fold (range ≥ 2.3-≥3.2) higher in encephalitis patients compared to the meningitis group. CSF urocanic acid levels were significantly lower in patients with encephalitis compared to those with meningitis (p = 0.012209). Follow-up analyses showed fluctuations in the levels of O-phosphoethanolamine, succinic acid, and L-proline in the encephalitis group, and pyruvic acid in the meningitis group. TBEV-infection of hMNs increased the production of SAM, FBP1 and PEP in a time-dependent manner. Depletion of the metabolites with characterised pharmacological inhibitors led to a concentration-dependent attenuation of virus growth, validating the identified changes as key mediators of TBEV infection. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the neurological disease outcome of TBEV infection is associated with specific and dynamic metabolic signatures in the cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a new in vitro model for in-depth studies of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis, in which the depletion of identified metabolites limits virus infection. Collectively, this reveals new biomarkers that can differentiate and predict TBEV-associated neurological disease. Additionally, we have identified novel therapeutic targets with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of TBEV pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Background: Respiratory droplets are the main way in which the COVID-19 pandemic’s causal agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), spreads. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, especially in lung cells, allow the virus to enter host cells. However, ACE2 expression in intestinal cells has sparked worries about possible fecal transfer, particularly in poor-sanitation areas like India. Methods: Between July 2021 and July 2024, clinical (nasopharyngeal, saliva, and stool samples) and sewage samples were collected from outpatient departments and sewage treatment plants (STPs), respectively, from the high-population-density area under study in order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Results: This proof-of-concept study analyzed clinical samples from n = 60 COVID-19-positive patients at a central Indian tertiary care hospital and n = 156 samples from hospital STPs. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 were found using qRT-PCR and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Of the n = 37 qRT-PCR-positive patients who gave their assent, 30% had stool samples that tested positive for viral RNA. In 70% of positive NP and 65% of positive saliva samples, along with two stool samples from immunocompromised patients, the live virus was identified using Vero E6 cell lines. Although 18% of the tests reported qRT-PCR-positive results, no live virus was detected in sewage samples despite NGS validation. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of confirmed clinical cases may indicate the silent circulation of the virus within the community, suggesting that sewage surveillance can serve as an early warning system before an outbreak occurs. Conclusions: These findings provide critical insights into the importance of continuous environmental surveillance, silent virus circulation, changes in viral epidemiology throughout the years, and strategies to mitigate coronavirus outbreaks.">

Results The neutralizing antibodies titers against WT and BA.5 strain, remaining high level for at least 6 months, were higher than that of both XBB.1 and EG.5 variants. The neutralizing antibodies of WT, BA.5, XBB.1, and EG.5 strains in the elderly were slightly lower than those in middle-age. The memory B cells decreased rapidly in the elderly, and Tfh, Th17 cells of the elderly continued to increase for only 3 months, while Tfh and Th17 cells increased in the middle-aged for over 6 months. For the elderly, after peptide stimulation, unswitched/switched memory B cells decreased, while double negative B cells displayed higher proliferation. The proportions of both naïve and Temra cells in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells declined, whereas those of Tcm and Tem cells elevated. In the meantime, both CD69+ and CD38+ T cells decreased, but the frequencies of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed an increasing trend. The proportions of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ cells also increased in older people with long COVID symptoms at 3m post-infection. Conclusions Omicron BA.5 infection induced lower neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1 and EG.5 variant. The decrease of memory B cells, CD69+ and CD38+T cells, as well as the increase of PD-1+, CTLA-4+ of CD4+/CD8+T cells and double negative B cells, indicate that sustained immune responses against BA.5 infection may wane more rapidly in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Changes in brain iron levels are a consistent feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) over its disease course. They encompass iron loss in oligodendrocytes in myelinated brain regions and iron accumulation in myeloid cells at so-called paramagnetic rims of chronic active lesions. Here, we explore the mechanisms behind this overall shift of iron from oligodendrocytes (OLs) to myeloid cells (MCs) and the loss of total brain-iron in MS. We investigated the expression of various iron importers and exporters, applying immunohistochemistry to a sample of control and MS autopsy cases. Additionally, we studied the transcriptional response of iron-related genes in primary rodent OL progenitor cells (OPCs) and microglia (MG) to various combinations of known MS-relevant pro-inflammatory stimuli together with iron loading. Histologically, we identified a correlation of OL-iron accumulation and the expression of the ferritin receptor TIM1 in myelinated white matter and observed an increase in the expression of iron-related proteins in myeloid cells at the lesion rims of MS plaques. qPCR revealed a marked increase of the heme scavenging and degradation machinery of MG under IFN-γ exposure, while OPCs changed to a more iron-inert phenotype with apparent decreased iron handling capabilities under MS-like inflammatory stimulation. Collectively, our data suggest that OL iron loss in MS is mainly due to a decrease in ferritin iron import. Iron accumulation in MCs at rims of chronic active lesions is in part driven by up-regulation of heme import and metabolism, while these cells also actively export ferritin.

        <tr id="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), stands as one of the most severe pandemics the world has ever faced in recent times. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of symptoms, varying from severe manifestations to mild cases and even asymptomatic carriers. This diversity stems from a multitude of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral variants, and immune status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system engages pattern recognition receptors, setting off a series of intricate signalling cascades. These cascades culminate in the activation of innate immune responses, including induction of type I and type III interferons. The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose challenges to the innate immune system defense. Therefore, investigating the innate immune response is crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophoshate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, a critical innate immune mechanism, represents a promising target for intervention at multiple stages to reduce the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other immune responses critical for SARS-CoV-2 defence. As part of the therapeutic approach, we extend our review to highlight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as emerging and effective therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 by targeting different stages of the innate immune system. A diverse range of mAbs has been explored to address specific targets within the innate immune pathways. A deep understanding of innate immunity and targeted monoclonal therapeutics will be instrumental in combating viruses and their variants, laying the foundation for enhanced treatment and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Significance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) employs multiple strategies to evade human antiviral defenses, leading to potentially severe outcomes such as pneumonia and death. A detailed investigation of these evasion strategies should enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and guide future vaccine development. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15) and demonstrate that its endoribonuclease activity delays the activation of antiviral responses in human lung cells. SARS-CoV-2 variants lacking this activity exhibit impaired replication and cause milder disease in animals, highlighting nsp15 as a key virulence factor. These findings underscore the importance of nsp15’s endoribonuclease activity in both promoting virus replication and influencing disease severity.">

Most research into these neurological sequalae focuses on the CNS, disregarding the PNS. Guinea pigs were previously shown to be useful models of disease during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic. However, their suitability for studying SARS-CoV-2 has not been experimentally demonstrated. To assess the suitability of guinea pigs as models for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the PNS, and to determine routes of CNS invasion through the PNS, we intranasally infected wild-type Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. We assessed PNS sensory neurons (trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia), autonomic neurons (superior cervical ganglia), brain regions (olfactory bulb, brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus), lungs, and blood for viral RNA (RT-qPCR), protein (immunostaining), and infectious virus (plaque assay) at three- and six-days post infection. We show that guinea pigs, which have previously been used as a model of SARS-CoV-1 pulmonary disease, are not susceptible to intranasal infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, and are not useful models in assessing neurological impacts of infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the early pandemic.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculous meningitis is the most severe form of tuberculosis and HIV-1 co-infection worsens the already poor prognosis. However, how Mycobacterium tuberculosis crosses the blood-brain barrier and how HIV-1 influences tuberculous meningitis pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Using human pericytes, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia alone and combined in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, we investigated the effect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis +/- HIV-1 co-infection on central nervous system cell entry and function. Cells and the blood-brain barrier model were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and/or HIV-1 and we evaluated the effects of both infection on (i) cells susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its growth in cells by flow cytometry; (ii) modulation of blood-brain barrier permeability and Mycobacterium tuberculosis passage through it; (iii) viral and bacterial cytopathogenicity using the xCELLigence system; (iv) cell metabolic activity and ROS release using colorimetric assays; (v) extracellular glutamate concentration by fluorometric assay; (vi) the inflammatory response by Luminex; and (vii) endoplasmic reticulum stress by quantitative PCR. Results We demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects and multiplies in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis also induces an increase of the blood-brain barrier permeability resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects include (i) increased markers of cellular stress (mitochondrial metabolic activity, unfolded protein response); (ii) ROS release; (iii) the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes; (iv) and the secretion of the excitotoxic neurotransmitter glutamate. Lastly, we observed distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators. Conclusion These results indicate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can translocate the blood-brain barrier directly to initiate meningitis.

To explore variations in immune cell subsets and their link to clinical heterogeneity, here we perform single-cell profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 SSc patients who never received immunosuppressive therapy. We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression. Thus, our single-cell analysis reveals distinct immune cell abnormalities associated with clinical organ manifestations, providing insights into tailored treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial arteries, accompanied by the formation of fragile collateral vessels, ultimately leading to ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Immune dysregulation, particularly involving T cell abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MMD; however, their precise relationship remains unclear. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with MMD and healthy controls were analyzed using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and transcriptomic profiling. Additionally, clinical characteristics and neuroimaging data were collected to perform integrated correlation analyses with immune profiling data. Results Patients with MMD exhibited aberrant T cell activation and altered subset distribution, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation capacity. Increased oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress were observed in T cells, along with disease-specific downregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1 and ICOS. Conclusions This study highlights the critical involvement of immune activation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of MMD, providing novel insights into disease mechanisms and identifying immunometabolic pathways as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)-related kinase 2 (NEK2), a member of the serine-threonine kinase family, is critically involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Upregulation of NEK2 is associated with aberrant B cell proliferation, a phenomenon potentially driven by NEK2-mediated disruption of the PKM1/PKM2 equilibrium. The overexpression of NEK2 in the B cell lineage may facilitate the maturation processes of B cells. Nonetheless, the precise role of NEK2 in modulating B cell-mediated immunity in autoimmune disorders remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that NEK2 was significantly upregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Pharmacological inhibition of NEK2 resulted in a marked reduction in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on B cells, concomitant with a suppression of their proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and class-switched memory B cells (SWM). Administration of the NEK2 inhibitor INH1 in a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) led to notable improvements in neurological function, amelioration of demyelination, and a decrease in the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system (CNS) compared to vehicle-treated EAE mice. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that NEK2 inhibition downregulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and diminished the proportion of Th1 cells in the CD4 + T cell population. In vitro studies further substantiated that NEK2 blockade attenuated CD4 + T cell proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells by disrupting B-T cell interactions. Collectively, these findings underscore an immunomodulatory function for NEK2 and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

In the current study, our clinical observation study establishes a strong correlation between elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA and poor prognosis. In vivo studies further reveal endothelial cells as an important source responsible for releasing mtDNA into circulation, which promotes B cell activation, migration, and differentiation via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Notably, TLR9 activation enhances B-cell susceptibility to SFTSV infection. These findings suggest that mtDNA released by injured endothelial cells facilitates B cell differentiation and virus replication, emphasizing the significant role of mitochondrial damage within endothelial cells in contributing to the severity of SFTS outcomes. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new acute tick-borne infectious disease with a high fatality rate of 10%–50%. There is a strong correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. Our research has revealed the crucial role of mtDNA in predicting the prognosis of SFTS and its impact on vascular endothelial injuries as well as B cell differentiation, two previously unexplored features of SFTSV infection. Moreover, mtDNA could activate the TLR9 signal to induce plasmablast differentiation in B cells and promote SFTSV infection. This study provides valuable mechanistic and clinical insights into the adverse outcomes associated with SFTSV infection.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toxoplasma gondii is a foodborne intracellular parasite that chronically infects the brain. Although T. gondii infection elicits a protective immune response, the nature of the monocyte response in the immediate vicinity of parasites during initial brain infection is not well understood. By infecting mice with T. gondii and comparing areas of the brain containing or not containing parasites, we found an increase in CCR2+ monocytes, IBA1+ myeloid cells, GFAP+ astrocytes, and CD68+ signal near parasites in the brain, indicating immune cell infiltration and phagolysosomal activation in response to the infection. CCR2+CD68+ monocytes were specifically increased near tachyzoites with minimal localization of these cells near cysts in the brain. This monocyte response was also detected near parasite-interacted cells, identified using T. gondii parasites that inject Cre recombinase into “interacted” cells of Ai6 CCR2RFP/+ mice, enabling us to track these events in vivo. The chemokine CCL2 and its transcription factor NF-κB were also upregulated surrounding parasites in the brain; however, the T. gondii effector protein GRA15, which sustains NF-κB activation in infected cells, was not required for CCL2 production, NF-κB activation, or myeloid cell recruitment to parasites in the brain. In contrast, active T. gondii replication played a more significant role, as CCR2+ monocytes were recruited to replication-competent but not replication-deficient T. gondii delivered via intracranial injection into mice. These findings provide novel insights into the drivers of immune cell mobilization and activation in the brain during initial T. gondii central nervous system infection and highlight the importance of parasite replication in this process. IMPORTANCE Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-infecting parasite, and the mobilization of peripheral immune cells to the brain is critical for controlling T. gondii infection. However, the initial events driving these cells to sites of T. gondii infection in the brain are poorly understood. We show that peripheral myeloid immune cell recruitment and activation are specific to areas of the brain containing actively replicating parasites, which are capable of lysing host cells. This local immune response is characterized by focal chemokine production, myeloid cell recruitment, and the activation of phagolysosomal pathways. These highly localized host responses were independent of the parasite effector protein that induces NF-κB activation within infected cells, GRA15. However, the localized monocyte recruitment was dependent on live parasites and active parasite replication. This research highlights the importance of host cell sensing of parasite replication in the brain for immune control of T. gondii infection.

        <tr id="Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating symptom in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Fresh insights indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may undergo neuron-like differentiation, potentially contributing to pain mechanisms. By examining the apolipoprotein E (APOE) together with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), this study aims to clarify their joint function in modulating differentiation and how this interplay might be implicated in chronic pain associated with NPC. Through comprehensive analysis using TCGA-NPC transcriptomic datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we assessed the molecular landscapes of both NPC-affected and healthy nasopharyngeal tissues. Differential gene expression and immune cell profiling identified macrophages as key players in the inflammatory response. Single-cell sequencing revealed a distinct subpopulation of neuron-like macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes. Macrophage-to-neuron-like cell transformation in response to NPC cells was examined through in vitro co-culture systems, highlighting the involvement of the APOE-TREM2 regulatory pathway. In vivo studies involved macrophage depletion and TREM2 knockdown in mouse models to evaluate the impact on chronic pain development. Infiltrating macrophages were significantly more abundant in NPC samples, with many exhibiting neuron-like features that were positively linked to high levels of WNT5 A expression. In vitro, NPC cells induced macrophage differentiation into neuron-like cells, a process regulated by TREM2 and APOE. TREM2 knockdown in macrophages resulted in a reduction of chronic pain behaviors in mouse models, highlighting the contribution of the APOE-TREM2 Axis to NPC-associated chronic pain. Our findings demonstrate that NPC cells promote macrophage reprogramming through the APOE-TREM2 Axis, leading to neuron-like differentiation and contributing to chronic pain in NPC patients. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing chronic pain in NPC. Graphical Abstract 1. Neuron-like macrophages contribute to chronic pain in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through the APOE-TREM2 axis. 2. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a unique subset of macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes in NPC tissues. 3. APOE-TREM2 signaling regulates the neuronal-like differentiation of macrophages, promoting pain-related pathways in NPC. 4. Targeting the APOE-TREM2 axis may offer novel therapeutic strategies for alleviating chronic pain in NPC patients.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a highly transmissible acute respiratory infection that can result in severe pneumonia and death. Many details of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully understood, including the cell biology and host-virus interactions involved in coronavirus assembly and release, in which the Envelope (E) structural protein is instrumental. Deletion of E in other coronaviruses has been shown previously to either attenuate or abrogate infection. To determine the role of E on SARS-CoV-2 virus production and infectivity, we produced reporter SARS-CoV-2 with or without the E gene deleted using a bacterial artificial chromosome. Replication of ΔE SARS-CoV-2 was attenuated in Vero E6 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and in human epithelial cell lines. Electron and immunofluorescence microscopy and virology assays showed that ΔE SARS-CoV-2 increased cell surface expression of Spike (S) glycoprotein, leading to reduced S incorporation into ΔE SARS-CoV-2 particles and promotion of increased cell-to-cell transmission that evades neutralizing antibody inhibition. Trans-complementation of E partially rescued ΔE SARS-CoV-2 S incorporation and restored cell-free transmission. In addition to validating the role of E in retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), our results showed that a lack of E led to reorganization of the ERGIC during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Improved understanding of E in SARS-CoV-2 replication and host pathogenesis may help development of novel therapeutics. Importance Non-S coronavirus structural proteins, including E, are conserved, making them potential pan-coronavirus therapeutic targets. Many details about these proteins and their roles in viral replication and host pathogenesis are unknown. In this study, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 replicates without E but is attenuated and impaired for virus particle formation, with less S incorporated into virions and more S expressed on the cell surface compared to wild-type virus. SARS-CoV-2 lacking E spread primarily via cell fusion and evaded neutralizing antibodies. In addition, the absence of E resulted in the reorganization of the ERGIC cell secretory compartment during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A better understanding of how E influences SARS-CoV-2 replication could guide directed design of novel therapeutics for treatment of COVID-19 patients, as well as the potential for pan-coronavirus protection against future coronavirus outbreaks.">

        <tr id="Introduction The immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in the context of long COVID, remain critical areas of study. Understanding these responses is essential for addressing the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Recent research also highlights the pivotal role of proteases in modulating immune responses and contributing to disease severity, making them a key focus of our analysis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 72 convalescent COVID-19 patients, assessing recovery at three key time points: immediately post-discharge, one month later, and three months post-infection. Additionally, a subset of 15 patients was followed up two years post-COVID-19. Clinical parameters, including demographics, comorbidities, treatment modalities, and COVID-19 severity, were evaluated. Using CyTOF technology, we characterized over 30 immune cell subsets, including granulocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We also performed multiplexed analyses of blood samples to profile cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and COVID-19-related proteins. Results Our comprehensive approach revealed significant changes in the immune system over time, highlighting the role of specific immune cells and proteases in the recovery process. Key findings include a decreasing deregulatory effect on immune responses exerted by subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Conclusion This study provides an in-depth understanding of the molecular dynamics of immune recovery following COVID-19. By integrating clinical profiling, plasma multiplex analysis, antibody profiling, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, in vitro PBMC stimulation, and the role of proteases, we offer valuable insights into the complex interplay of immune, inflammatory, and protease-mediated responses in individuals recovering from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Mitochondrial diseases (MtD) represent a significant public health challenge due to their heterogenous clinical presentation, often severe and progressive symptoms, and lack of effective therapies. Environmental exposures, such bacterial and viral infection, can further compromise mitochondrial function and exacerbate the progression of MtD. However, the underlying immune alterations that enhance immunopathology in MtD remain unclear. Here we employ in vitro and in vivo approaches to clarify the molecular and cellular basis for innate immune hyperactivity in models of polymerase gamma (Polg)-related MtD. We reveal that type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated upregulation of caspase-11 and guanylate-binding proteins (GBP) increase macrophage sensing of the opportunistic microbe Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in Polg mutant mice. Furthermore, we show that excessive cytokine secretion and activation of pyroptotic cell death pathways contribute to lung inflammation and morbidity after infection with PA. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for understanding innate immune dysregulation in MtD and reveals potential targets for limiting infection- and inflammation-related complications in Polg-related MtD.">

        <tr id="Background We recently demonstrated that systemically transplanted astrocytic mitochondria enter the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)–affected brain, where they protect the neurons by mitigating oxidative damage via upregulation of the manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), ultimately contributing to functional recovery after ICH in mice. Although our previous study clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of mitochondria within the brain, the effect of transferred mitochondria on the peripheral system was not yet studied. Thus, here, we studied the impact of astrocytic mitochondria transfer on post-ICH recovery and modulation of systemic immune responses. Methods We used the autologous blood injection model for the mouse ICH surgery. Mice subjected to ICH received astrocytic mitochondria intravenously at 1 h, 7, and 14 days post-ICH onset, and the splenic immune responses of these mice were analyzed at 21 days. An ICH-like injury was induced in vitro using primary cultured neurons treated with recombinant interleukin-10, and cell viability, reactive oxygen species levels, and gene expressions were analyzed. Results We demonstrate that systemic transplantation of astrocytic mitochondria increases the population of splenic B cells, production of interleukin-10 by B cells, and plasma interleukin-10 levels in mice after ICH. Furthermore, in the ICH-like injury in vitro, exogenous interleukin-10 (to model spleen-mediated interleukin-10 increase) upregulated Mn-SOD expression in the cultured neurons and promoted neuronal survival and neuroplasticity-related gene expressions, suggesting interleukin-10 role in cytoprotection and repair/recovery under ICH-like condition. Conclusions Thus, systemic transfer of astrocytic mitochondria modulates post-ICH peripheral immune responses, which may participate in functional recovery.">

        <tr id="Impaired spermatogenesis has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on male fertility remains unclear. The purpose of this multicenter study was to investigate the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and determine the potential reasons leading to impaired male reproductive functions. In silico approach identified ~60 amino acid sequences containing at least five continuous residues shared by SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and spermatogenesis-linked proteins. Four synthetic peptides were tested with sera from independent cohorts of patients with acute and long COVID-19 syndrome (LCS), and naïve vaccinated subjects. Immunogenicity and pathogenicity studies were performed by immunizing mice with two selected peptides and testing the antigenicity of induced antibodies. While none of four peptides were recognized by antibodies from vaccinated people, infected patients exhibited high reactivity to peptide 4, and LCS patients, especially women, showed elevated antibody levels against peptide 2. Women with LCS and chronic fatigue syndrome had higher levels of peptide 2–reacting antibodies than those with idiopathic chronic fatigue syndrome. Noteworthy, peptide 2 antibodies showed, in in vitro experiment, a specific interaction with mouse testicular tissue antigens. These findings raise the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and spermatogenesis-related antigens may affect infected patients’ fertility, suggesting a potential for autoimmune responses with human consequences.">

        <tr id="The mammalian body possesses remarkable adaptability to cold exposure, involving intricate adjustments in cellular metabolism, ultimately leading to thermogenesis. However, cold‐induced stress can impact immune response, primarily through noradrenaline‐mediated pathways.

To provide human relevance, we included a group of regular cold swimmers in our study. Our research revealed complex relationship between cold exposure, neural signaling, immune response, and thermogenic regulation. One‐day cold exposure triggered stress response, including cytokine production in white adipose tissue, subsequently activating brown adipose tissue, and inducing thermogenesis. We further studied systemic immune response, including the proportion of leukocytes and cytokines production. Interestingly, γδ T cells emerged as possible regulators in the broader systemic response, suggesting their possible contribution in the dynamic process of cold adaptation. We employed RNA‐seq to gain further insights into the mechanisms by which γδ T cells participate in the response to cold. Additionally, we challenged rats exposed to cold with the Toll‐like receptor 2 agonist, showing significant modulation of immune response.

        <tr id="For a more precise understanding of the course of the pathological process in patients with severe COVID-19, it is necessary to continue the search for factors that affect the course of the pathological process and the possibility of a favorable outcome in critically ill patients. Comparative RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) in patients with a severe clinical course of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta strain revealed a number of differentially expressed genes that distinguish patients with different clinical outcomes (survivors vs. nonsurvivors) in the period of 30 days after admission to the hospital. Most of them are associated with the “negative regulation of viral process” and “negative regulation of immune response” clusters. Moreover, in surviving patients, there is increased expression of the key genes C1QB, C1QA, ISG15, SERPING1, VSIG4, KLRD1, TRPM4, and HFE incorporated in these clusters. Among these key genes, the ISG15 gene, which links several clusters of gene ontology enrichments and encodes an interferon-induced ubiquitin-like protein, deserves special attention. Its product, ISG15, is known to be a primary substrate for SARS-CoV-2 protease PLpro, which plays a role in counteracting hosts’ antiviral mechanisms.

 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly burdened global public health. However, the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 within the human body remains not fully understood. In this review, we overview the literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection across various human organs and tissues. We summarize the relevant specimen types, techniques for examining SARS-CoV-2 tropism, and findings at both organ/tissue and cellular levels. To systematically evaluate the evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism, we establish a hierarchical classification system based on two key criteria: (1) specimen origin and (2) detection methodology. Clinical specimens obtained directly from COVID-19 patients provide the most definitive evidence, whereas organoid-derived specimens and animal models indicate potential infectivity under artificial conditions. In terms of detection methods, we prioritize viral particle identification over viral protein or RNA detection, as the latter requires further confirmation to establish productive infection. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 potentially targets multiple human organ systems, including the respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, pancreas, small intestine, liver, and salivary glands. By contrast, viral tropism for the central nervous system and the reproductive system remains uncertain and requires further validation. At the cellular level, we identify specific target cell types vulnerable to infection, including ciliated epithelial cells, alveolar type II pneumocytes, enterocytes, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, and pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor distribution patterns and viral tropism, as well as potential variations in tissue specificity among different viral variants. We expect this review to provide a comprehensive landscape of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and enhance our understanding of the life cycle and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the human body.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Herpes simplex virus‐1 (HSV‐1) infections are lifelong and linked to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), yet the underlying mechanisms in the host remain poorly understood. Methods and Results This study investigates new molecular dynamics following HSV‐1 infection, uncovering the pivotal role of the mixed lineage kinase domain‐like (MLKL) protein. Beyond its known function in necroptosis, MLKL was found to control HSV‐1 transport into the nucleus, tightly regulated by Optineurin (OPTN). We evidenced an essential regulatory interaction between MLKL and OPTN, governing MLKL's activity in both necroptosis‐dependent and independent pathways. In vivo, studies using Optn knockout mice demonstrated how this MLKL‐OPTN axis contributes to demyelination and neurological symptoms mimicking MS. This axis critically prevents oligodendrocyte death and the associated demyelination during HSV‐1 infection. Furthermore, pharmacological interventions with Necrosulfonamide (NSA), an MLKL inhibitor, showed therapeutic potential in preserving myelin integrity and reducing neurological deficits in HSV‐1‐infected models, suggesting a viable strategy for managing virus‐induced neurodegeneration. Conclusion Our findings highlight the significant role of MLKL in HSV‐1 pathogenesis and suggest that MLKL dysregulation is a key mechanism behind severe neurological damage. Key points MLKL plays a significant role in regulating endosomal transport of HSV‐1 to nucleus during early stages of infection. Formation of p‐MLKL bodies during HSV‐1 infection leads to death of oligodendrocyte and subsequent demyelination. OPTN can negatively modulate MLKL levels to restrict infection and consequential oligodendrocyte death during HSV‐1 infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 leads to irregularities in immune response regulation and is believed to contribute to autoimmune diseases, highlighting a significant link between viral infections and autoimmune diseases. This connection arises from the molecular and immunological interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host. Autoimmunity can be triggered by various factors that create an overly stimulated immune system. The virus activates both innate and adaptive immunity, which can result in disease progression. COVID-19 disrupts normal antiviral immunity and plays a role in the onset of autoimmune diseases. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, including molecular mimicry, bystander activation of T-cells, transient immunosuppression, and inflammation. Additionally, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may also provoke autoimmunity. In this review, we explore the various factors through which SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to autoimmune diseases, aiming to minimize the risk of developing such conditions following COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.">

        <tr id="Background Long-COVID immunopathogenesis involves diverse factors. We longitudinally characterize hospitalized COVID-19 patients, examining the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and inflammation in immune dysregulation. Methods Hospitalized patients are evaluated during acute infection (T0), 3 months post-symptom onset (T1), and 3 years if symptoms persisted (T2). Immune profile includes characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-specific T/B cells (flow cytometry) and antibodies (ELISA, neutralization, ADCC). RNAemia and cytokines are quantified (RT-PCR, cytometric beads array) and correlated. Statistics: non-parametric cross-sectional, longitudinal and correlation analyses. Results Here we show 48 hospitalized individuals during acute COVID-19, 38 exhibit early persistent symptoms (EPS+) 3 months post-symptoms onset, 10 do not (EPS−). Groups are comparable for age, sex, co-morbidities. The EPS+ shows fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia/dysgeusia, diarrhea, chronic pain, mnestic disorders. Over time, they show a reduction of neutralization ability and total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, with increased total CD4 TEMRA, and failure to increase RBD-specific B cells and IgA+ MBCs. EPS+ patients show higher levels of T0-IFN-γ + CD4 TEMRA, T1-IL-2 + CD4 TEM and T1-TNF-α + CD4 cTfh. In EPS+, baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positively correlates with CD4 TEMRA, follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with ADCC. Among 38 EPS+ individuals at T1, 33 are evaluated 3 years after infection, 5 are lost at follow-up. 10/33 EPS+ show long-term symptoms (late persistent symptoms, EPS + LPS+), whereas 23/33 fully recover (EPS + LPS−). Antibodies, RNAemia, and cytokines show no differences between/within groups at any time point. Conclusions Early persistent symptoms are associated with multi-layered SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune dysregulation. The shift towards non-Ag-specific TEMRA and ADCC trigger in EPS+ may relate to SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Early immune dysregulation does not associate with long-term persistent symptoms. Further research on SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and early immune dysregulation is needed.">

        <tr id="Rasmussen Encephalitis (RE) is a chronic, unilateral epileptic disorder mostly found in children. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by T lymphocyte infiltration targeting neurons and leading to microglia activation, astrogliosis, and cortical degeneration. Within a patient’s brain, distinct pathological stages are found that offer a unique opportunity to study T cell dynamics in situ. Using quantitative multiplex fluorescence imaging, we analyzed CD103+ and CD69+ Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) across different disease stages. This analysis revealed that TRM were more abundant in the parenchyma than in the perivascular space, suggesting that their differentiation occurs locally after antigen encounter. Further, part of the TRM expressed Granzyme-B (GrB) and frequently were attached to neurons, suggesting that they are actively involved in neuronal destruction. While TRM showed a stage-dependent increase in older lesions, the proportions of these cells did not correlate with disease duration, indicating that their accumulation may be more dependent on the local environment in the lesion than on the length of the disease. In addition, we found that T cells using the γδ T cell receptor comprised up to 66%. Like CD8+ T cells, the γδ T cells could develop a TRM phenotype and, while expressing GrB+ granules, they were seen attached to neurons, suggesting that they are involved in neuronal destruction. Finally, analysis of exhaustion- and TRM-associated immune checkpoint control markers PD-1 and LAG-3 revealed a significant stage-dependent increase in PD-1 expression in the oldest lesions. In contrast, LAG-3 expression did not show any stage-specific pattern, pointing towards a distinct regulatory mechanism. The study demonstrates a dynamic and one-way T cell response throughout the course of RE at a given spot in the CNS: from the establishment of T cell residence after entry into the CNS, the killing of neurons, and eventually T cell exhaustion. It further suggests an important role of γδ T-cells in the propagation of disease and lesions.

        <tr id="Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol. Results We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent. Conclusions Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

        <tr id="Despite waning of virus-neutralizing antibodies, protection against severe SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of immune individuals remains high, but the underlying immune mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, rhesus macaques with pre-existing immunity from Novavax WA-1 and/or P.1 vaccines and WA-1 or P.1 infection are immunized with a bivalent WA-1/Omicron BA.5 Novavax vaccine ten months after the last exposure. The boost vaccination primarily increases the frequency of cross-reactive spike (S)-specific antibodies and B cells instead of inducing de novo BA.5-specific responses. Reinfection with heterologous Omicron XBB.1.5 six months after the boost vaccination results in low levels of virus replication in the respiratory tract compared with virus-naïve results from other studies. Whereas systemic S-specific immunity remains largely unchanged in all animals, the animals with complete protection from infection exhibit a stronger influx of S-specific IgG, monocytes, B cells and T cells into the bronchioalveolar space combined with expansion of CD69+CD103+ lung tissue-resident, S-specific CD8 T cells compared to actively infected animals. Our results underscore the importance of localized respiratory immune responses in mediating protection from Omicron reinfection and provide guidance for future vaccine development.">

        <tr id="Microglial cells, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are essential for maintaining CNS homeostasis. Dysregulation of microglial function is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptors 1 and 2 (VPAC1 and VPAC2) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed by microglia, with their primary ligands being pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). However, the specific roles of VPAC-type receptors in microglial regulation remain poorly understood. In this study, we generated VPAC1+/− and VPAC2+/− BV2 microglial cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and conducted a series of biological and molecular assays to elucidate the functions of these receptors. Our findings demonstrated that both mutant cell lines exhibited a polarized phenotype and increased migratory activity. VPAC1+/− cells showed enhanced survivability and baseline activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a protective mechanism triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, whereas this response appeared impaired in VPAC2+/− cells. In contrast, under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions, UPR activation was impaired in VPAC1+/− cells but restored in VPAC2+/− cells, resulting in improved survival of VPAC2+/− cells, whereas VPAC1+/− cells exhibited reduced resilience. Overall, our findings suggest that VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors play distinct yet complementary roles in BV2 microglia. VPAC2 is critical for regulating survival, ER stress responses, and polarization under basal conditions, while VPAC1 is essential for adaptive responses to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS. These insights advance our understanding of microglial receptor signaling and may inform therapeutic strategies targeting microglial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="Viral infections have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune-mediated disease in the central nervous system (CNS). Since Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) can induce MS-like demyelination, TMEV infection is the most widely used viral model for MS. Although the precise pathophysiology is unknown, altered fecal bacterial populations were associated with distinct immune gene expressions in the CNS. We aimed to determine the role of gut microbiota in TMEV infection by administering an antibiotic cocktail in drinking water before (prophylactic administration) or after (therapeutic administration) TMEV infection. The antibiotic administration reduced total eubacteria, including the phyla Bacillota and Bacteroidota, but increased the phylum Pseudomonadata in feces. Prophylactic administration did not alter TMEV-induced inflammatory demyelination clinically or histologically, without changes in anti-viral IgG1/IgG2c levels or lymphoproliferative responses; therapeutic administration temporarily suppressed the neurological signs. Although antibiotic treatment had minimal effects on TMEV infection, adding metronidazole and ampicillin in drinking water substantially reduced water intake in the antibiotic group of mice, resulting in significant body weight loss. Since dehydration and stress could affect immune responses and gut microbiota, caution should be exercised when planning or evaluating the oral antibiotic cocktail treatment in experimental animals.">

        <tr id="Although SARS-CoV-2 reinfections remain a concern for healthcare systems worldwide, the factors driving them are still not fully understood. In this study, we examined data for 3303 individuals who experienced two SARS-CoV-2 infections between March 2020 and May 2022 from both clinical and viral genomics perspectives. Our findings indicate that viral evolution was the primary driver of reinfection. However, chronic conditions were common among reinfected individuals, including those under 26 years old, suggesting that the presence of underlying and/or chronic conditions increases susceptibility to reinfection. The median time elapsed between infections was one year, often coinciding with the emergence of new variants. While vaccination showed only a limited protective effect against reinfection, it drastically decreased the hospitalization rate, underscoring its role in mitigating disease severity. Our findings point to the need for more flexible vaccination strategies, especially for individuals with chronic conditions. Understanding the interactions between host factors and viral evolution is critical to strengthening prevention strategies and reducing the burden of reinfections and their possible long-term complications.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which led to a global pandemic causing millions of deaths, is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- -2). While previous research on COVID-19 has primarily utilized nasal swabs and blood samples, these do not provide comprehensive insights into all the organ systems affected by the infection. A recent study by Topper et al. addressed this gap by analyzing both nasal samples and autopsy tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Their findings highlight a significant role of mitochondrial damage pathways and RAAS overactivation in contributing to the severity of SARSCoV- 2 infections. Importantly, targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and RAAS overactivation pathways may offer promising and specific druggable targets for treating COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a drastic loss of dopaminergic neurons already at diagnosis. As this loss of neurons starts decades before diagnosis, understanding the prodromal stages of the disease might offer novel strategies to curb its progression. While the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying PD remain incompletely understood, growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation play a central role in the development and progression of the disease. Here, we delve into the emerging roles of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, in the pathogenesis of prodromal and early-stage PD. We emphasize that microglia contribute to neuroinflammation, protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet known. Neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the patterns of microglial activation detected in individuals with prodromal PD and at the time of clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, we highlight the complex interplay between immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration along PD development, including alterations in the peripheral immune system, brain-gut interactions and brain-immune interfaces. Lastly, we outline existing models for investigating microglial involvement in prodromal PD, along with the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies and strategies to modify risk factors. In conclusion, targeting microglial activation and immune dysfunctions in individuals at risk of PD could represent a promising preventive measure and may offer novel therapeutic strategies for early intervention and disease modification.">

        <tr id="Background Immune-mediated hearing loss (IMHL) patients (comprised of autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL)) may be at higher risk for hearing loss following Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and/or vaccination. Methods We compared inflammatory cytokine expression in response to SARS-CoV2 spike protein between two groups of patients with IMHL: IMHL patients that temporally demonstrated worsening SNHL following COVID vaccination or infection as compared to IMHL patients with worsening SNHL unrelated to COVID exposure: (IMHL-COVID ( +)) (n = 11) (IMHL-COVID (-)) (n = 10). In these two groups, we treated isolated PBMCs with increasing amounts of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared responses to stimulation with positive and negative controls. Results Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) from IMHL-COVID ( +) patients had increased expression and release of both IL-1β and IL-6 in response to spike protein as compared to IMHL-COVID (-) patients. However, when the IMHL-COVID ( +) group was broken down into AIED patients compared to SSNHL, it became apparent that the greatest responses were from the AIED patients (p < 0.005 for IL-6 mRNA expression and p < 0.003 for IL-6 release when compared between any two similar groups using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test). When we broke down the COVID ( +) group to infection versus vaccination, the immune responses in the infection group (N = 3 AIED, 1 SSNHL) were stronger. Conclusions COVID-19 exposure with reported changes in hearing sensitivity in IMHL patients resulted in pro-inflammatory responses in response to spike protein. The inflammatory responses were greatest in AIED patients, and greater following infection rather than vaccination. Therefore, based on these studies, we would recommend AIED patients take additional precautions to avoid COVID exposure. Furthermore, we do recommend COVID vaccination during periods of hearing stability, as the immune responses are even more robust in response to infection in this vulnerable group.">

        <tr id="Background By employing a high-dimensionality approach, this study aims to identify mechanistically relevant cellular immune signatures that predict poor outcomes. Methods This prospective study recruited 39 children with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit and 19 healthy age-matched children. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied with mass cytometry. Unique cell subsets were identified in the paediatric sepsis immunome and depicted with t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (tSNE) plots. Network analysis was performed to quantify interactions between immune subsets. Enriched immune subsets were included in a model for distinguishing sepsis and validated by flow cytometry in an independent cohort. Results The median (interquartile range) age and paediatric sequential organ failure assessment (pSOFA) score in this cohort was 5.6(2.0, 11.3) years and 6.6 (IQR: 2.5, 10.1), respectively. High-dimensionality analyses of the immunome in sepsis revealed a loss of coordinated communication between immune subsets, particularly a loss of regulatory/inhibitory interaction between cell types, fewer interactions between cell subsets, and fewer negatively correlated edges than controls. Four independent immune subsets (CD45RA−CX3CR1+CTLA4+CD4+ T cells, CD45RA−17A+CD4+ T cells CD15+CD14+ monocytes, and Ki67+ B cells) were increased in sepsis and provide a predictive model for diagnosis with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC 0.90 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.82–0.98) in the discovery cohort and AUC 0.94 (95% CI 0.83–1.00) in the validation cohort. Conclusion The sepsis immunome is deranged with loss of regulatory/inhibitory interactions. Four immune subsets increased in sepsis could be used in a model for diagnosis and prediction of poor outcomes.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human health. The outcome of IAV results from the viral-host interaction, with the underlying molecular mechanisms largely unknown. By integrating the plasma proteomics data of the IAV-infected patients into the viral-inflammation protein-protein interaction (VI-PPI) network created in this study, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), the critical enzyme in purine salvage, was identified as a potential hub gene that connected the different stages of IAV infection. Extended survival rates and reduced pulmonary inflammatory lesions were observed in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-specific PNP conditional knockout mice upon H1N1 infection. Mechanistically, PB1-F2 of IAV was revealed as a novel viral transcriptional factor to bind to the TATA box of PNP promoter, leading to enhanced purine salvage in H1N1-challenged AECs. The activation of PNP-mediated purine salvage was verified in IAV-infected patients and A549 cells. PNP knockdown elicited a purine metabolic shift from augmented salvage pathway to de novo synthesis, constraining both viral infection and pro-inflammatory signaling through APRT-AICAR-AMPK activation. Moreover, durdihydroartemisinin (DHA), predicted by VI-PPI as a novel PNP inhibitor, exerted beneficial effects on the survival and weight gain of H1N1-challenged mice via its direct binding to PNP. To reveal for the first time, we found that PNP, activated by IAV, plays a hub role within H1N1-host interaction, simultaneously modulating viral replication and hyperinflammation through purine salvage. Our study sheds new light on a “two-for-one” strategy by targeting purine salvage in combating IAV-related pathology, suggesting PNP as a potential novel anti-influenza host target.">

        <tr id="Introduction Influenza infection is a significant threat to public health, and identifying dynamic biomarkers that influence disease progression is crucial for effective intervention. Methods We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of physiological and pathological parameters in Balb/c mice infected with H1N1 influenza over a 14-day period. We employed the DIABLO multi-omics integration method to analyze dynamic changes in the lung transcriptome, metabolome, and serum metabolome from mild to severe stages of infection. Results Our analysis highlighted the critical importance of intervention within the first 6 days post-infection to prevent severe disease. We identified several novel biomarkers associated with disease progression, including Ccl8, Pdcd1, Gzmk, kynurenine, L-glutamine, and adipoyl-carnitine. Additionally, we developed a serum-based influenza disease progression scoring system. Discussion This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying influenza progression and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The developed scoring system serves as a valuable tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of severe influenza.">

        <tr id="Recurrent COVID-19, defined as two or more distinct episodes, may reflect an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In this case–control study, we compared three groups: individuals with recurrent COVID-19, those with a single episode, and SARS-CoV-2-naïve controls. We genotyped six immune-related SNPs, including TLR7 rs179008, and measured CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens using flow cytometry. The T allele of TLR7 rs179008, previously linked to reduced receptor expression, was significantly overrepresented in the recurrent COVID-19 cohort. At baseline, frequencies of IFN-γ+, IL-2+, and TNF-α+ cells among CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not differ between groups. However, stratification by the rs179008 genotype revealed that T allele carriers displayed diminished IFN-γ production in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and reduced IL-2 production in CD4+ T cells. Following vaccination, T cell responses were comparable across all genotypes. The T allele of TLR7 rs179008 is associated with recurrent COVID-19 and may contribute to impaired T cell-mediated immunity. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanistic role of TLR7 variation in SARS-CoV-2 reinfection risk.">

        <tr id="Purpose The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 and RA through immune inflammation. Methods First, we conducted a meta-analysis on the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rate, and mortality rate for patients with RA. Then, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal relationship between COVID-19 and RA, and further analyzed the cytokines and immune cells in COVID-19 and RA. Finally, we obtained microarray datasets of COVID-19, RA patients, and normal controls from the GEO database. And performed functional, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analysis on differentially expressed genes between each group. Results The meta-analysis results suggested that the hospitalization rate and mortality rate of RA patients infected with COVID-19 were higher than those of the control population. MR analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 infection and RA. We also found that interleukin 13 was associated with RA and COVID-19 infection. CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells and CD3 on CD39 + CD8 + T cells are common immune cell phenotypes in two diseases. In addition, COVID-19 function is enriched in immune responses mediated by leukocytes and neutrophils, while RA is significantly enriched in the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that both diseases had more neutrophils and fewer CD8 T cells. Conclusion There are many similarities between COVID-19 and RA in immune inflammatory responses such as cytokines and immune cells. COVID-19 may lead to the development of RA through immune inflammation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00620-7.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The thymus exhibits constitutive activation of nearly all major inflammatory pathways, including sterile MyD88‐dependent signaling and interferon production by mTECs, the presence of cellular and molecular components of type 1, type 2, and type 3 responses, as well as sustained B cell activation. The reasons for the existence of such a complex constitutively active inflammatory network at the site of T cell development—where the initial pathogen encounter is unlikely—have remained enigmatic. We propose that this inflammatory thymic ‘ecosystem’ has evolved to promote immunological tolerance to ‘inflammatory self’—endogenous molecules absent from most peripheral tissues at steady state but upregulated during pathogen invasion. The spatial and temporal overlap with pathogen presence makes the discrimination of the inflammatory self from pathogen‐derived molecules a unique challenge for the adaptive immune system. The frequent occurrence of diseases associated with autoantibodies against proinflammatory cytokines underscores the persistent risk of these molecules being misidentified as foreign. Their abundant representation in the thymus, therefore, is likely to be critical for maintaining tolerance. This review explores current insights into the thymic inflammatory network, its cellular and molecular constituents, and their role in the induction of T cell tolerance.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persist in milder forms despite anti-retroviral therapy, leading to premature and exacerbated aging-related cognitive disorders. We investigated the interplay between HAND and aging in microglia, which constitute the main brain HIV reservoir. We compared the transcriptomic patterns associated with normal aging in healthy humans to those observed following HIV infection in both ex vivo and in vivo models. Single cell and bulk transcriptomic patterns revealed that HIV infection induces a pattern of cellular senescence, with strong parallels to the transcriptomic signature of normal aging. Both processes were characterized by p53 pathway activation, upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of proliferative genes while maintaining mTOR signaling, a pattern characteristic of cellular senescence. Importantly, both actively HIV infected and bystander microglia showed the cellular senescence patterns. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the observed premature brain aging in HAND, and identify senescence-associated pathways as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Long Covid is a post‐viral syndrome characterized by persistent symptoms targeting multiple organ systems after initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Current literature suggests that the mechanisms causing Long Covid involve viral persistence, immune dysregulation, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. By forming reservoirs in the tissues of various organs, SARS‐CoV‐2 may evade immunological clearances while triggering immune responses and contributing to chronic symptoms through cytokine imbalances, T‐cell exhaustion, and systemic inflammation. These symptoms parallel other post‐viral syndromes such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting similar mechanisms of pathology. The coronavirus has also been linked to neuroinflammation and endothelial dysfunction causing cognitive symptoms and cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, its ability to lower energy production links it to post‐exertion malaise (PEM) and muscle pain. These symptoms may result from iron dysregulation and persistent oxidative stress due to Covid‐impaired mitochondrial function. This review synthesizes current data on the mechanisms that drive Long Covid pathogenesis and explores potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate viral persistence, immune dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances. It is critical to understand these interactions to develop targeted interventions that address the long‐term sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease prevalent in 97 countries. Co-infection with HIV increases susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis (VL), accelerating HIV’s progression to AIDS. Managing VL in HIV-infected individuals is challenging due to atypical presentations and limited therapeutic responses, highlighting the need to develop new disease management strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great promise for this goal as they can be used for a higher understanding of biological processes and biomarker discovery. In this context, a proteomic analysis was carried out from plasma-EVs of an HIV/VL patient over two years and compared to HIV and healthy controls. The analysis confirmed classical EV markers but showed limited detection of Leishmania proteins. However, variations in human protein abundance related to relevant immunological processes were observed. Notably, the macrophage receptor with a collagenous structure (MARCO) was consistently detected only in the patient and not in the control groups. Significantly, the relevance of MARCO as a possible VL biomarker was confirmed using a validation cohort with five VL patients and its detection by Western Blot was possible. Although MARCO warrants further investigation as a VL related biomarker, the study of EVs confirmed their promise of being a privileged window into this disease. Future studies are needed to broaden data on EVs in infections to improve clinical management.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused a global public health crisis, with a significant impact on multiple body systems. This virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, shows ~80% genomic similarity to SARS-CoV and ~50% genomic similarity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The spike (S) protein plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the virus, as it facilitates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition to the respiratory system damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a variety of gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, cardiovascular (CV), ocular, renal, etc. clinical manifestations. Neurological complications, such as anosmia, ague, headache, encephalitis and cerebrovascular events, were frequently observed, being attributed to both direct viral invasion and a very strong systemic inflammatory response. GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common and may occur independently of respiratory symptoms, and the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) detected in fecal samples suggests possible fecal-oral transmission. The CV system is affected by myocardial damage, inflammation and coagulation disorders, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. At the ocular level, the virus was identified in ocular secretions, and conjunctivitis, uveitis and episcleritis were observed in about 11% of patients. Renal involvement, manifested by acute kidney injury, was detected in 0.5-7% of cases. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to respiratory tract involvement but also has significant systemic implications.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. Methods This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. Results Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Discussion Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="The immune mechanisms induced by the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, and the subset of which mediate protection against tuberculosis (TB), remain poorly understood. This is further complicated by difficulties to verify vaccine-induced protection in humans. Although research in animal models, namely mice and non-human primates (NHPs), has begun to close this knowledge gap, discrepancies in the relative importance of biological pathways across species limit the utility of animal model-derived biological insights in humans. To address these challenges, we applied a systems modeling framework, Translatable Components Regression (TransCompR), to identify human blood transcriptional variability which could predict Mtb challenge outcomes in BCG-vaccinated NHPs. These protection-associated pathways included both innate and adaptive immune activation mechanisms, along with signaling via type I interferons and anti-mycobacterial T helper cytokines. We further partially validated the associations between these mechanisms and protection in humans using publicly available microarray data collected from BCG-vaccinated infants who either developed TB or remained healthy during two years of follow-up. Overall, our work demonstrates how species translation modeling can leverage animal studies to generate hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie human infectious disease and vaccination outcomes, which may be difficult or impossible to ascertain using human data alone.">

        <tr id="Abstract Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Ross River (RRV), and O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV), are emerging and reemerging viruses that cause disease characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating muscle and joint pain and inflammation. Alphavirus infection induces robust immune responses, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines, including chemokine C ligand 4 (CCL4). CCL4 is a chemoattractant for immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruiting these cells to the site of infection, stimulating the release of proinflammatory mediators, and inducing T cell differentiation. CCL4 has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of CCL4 in arthritogenic alphavirus disease development remains unexplored. Here, we tested the effect of CCL4 on MAYV infection in mice through antibody neutralization and treatment with recombinant mouse CCL4. We observed no differences in mice depleted of CCL4 or treated with recombinant CCL4 in terms of disease progression such as weight loss and footpad swelling or the development of viremia. CCL4 uses the G protein-coupled receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). To determine whether CCR5 deficiency would alter disease outcomes or virus replication in mice, we inoculated CCR5 knockout (CCR5−−) mice with MAYV and observed no effect on disease development and immune cell profile of blood and footpads between CCR5−/− and wild type mice. These studies failed to identify a clear role for CCL4 or its receptor CCR5 in MAYV infection.">

To date, however, TAMV pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have established different mouse infection models to enable investigation of TAMV pathogenesis. Adult BALB/c mice did not exhibit obvious clinical symptoms or signs post-TAMV infection. In contrast, adult type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR−/−) A129 mice were found to be susceptible to high-doses of TAMV (6 × 102 and 6 × 104 FFU) and all developed severe clinical symptoms and signs, including weight loss and immobility, and reached the euthanasia criteria at 4/5-day post-infection (dpi). Viral RNA was detected in peripheral blood and different tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, and brain) of the high-dose infected adult A129 mice, with the highest viral loads in the liver (approximately 108.3 copies/μL). Pathological examination also revealed severe liver damage in the high-dose infected A129 mice. In addition, the titres of TAMV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies increased rapidly 4–5 dpi. Analysis of cytokine and chemokine expression changes demonstrated that type I IFN may play an important role in the host defence against viral infection by enhancing IL-10 production. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses showed that liver injury may be associated with virus-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Together, we have investigated TAMV pathogenesis using immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models, which will facilitate the development of TAMV-specific antivirals and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects various organs and systems, significantly impacting patients’ health and quality of life. Conventional drugs, including glucocorticoids and standard immunosuppressive drugs, may not be enough to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome in some refractory SLE patients. The abnormal phenotype and function of macrophages participate in the development of SLE. The targeted delivery to reprogram macrophage in SLE has been a long-standing challenge. Apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) are essential for intercellular communications. This study aims to explore an effective and targeted treatment to SLE via macrophage reprogramming and Treg differentiation. In this work, we found that M2 macrophages-derived ApoBDs (M2-ApoBDs) could selectively target and localize to the spleen, where they were engulfed by splenic macrophages (phagocytic rate 73.4%). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the efferocytosis of M2-ApoBDs triggered transcriptional changes in M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages within the spleen, subsequently promoting the differentiation of Treg cells in vivo. Immunological experiments revealed that M2-ApoBDs prompted the reprogramming of M2 macrophages in vitro, which subsequently influenced Treg cell differentiation via ligand-receptor interactions. In SLE mice, M2-ApoBDs alleviated the disease progression, including 24-hours urinary protein, plasma creatinine, plasma C3 levels, and glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. These findings show that M2-ApoBDs can targeted-modulate macrophage polarization and Treg immune regulation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for the effective treatment of SLE.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and systemic immune responses, particularly through the gut–lung axis. Disruptions in gut microbial diversity and function—commonly referred to as dysbiosis—have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed the gut bacteriome and permeability in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using 16S sequencing and ELISA assays, respectively. We also measured blood inflammatory cytokines and fecal secretory IgA to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Significant alterations in both alpha and beta diversity metrics were observed in patients with COVID-19 (n = 79) and those with post-COVID-19 condition (n = 141) compared to the controls (n = 97). Differential abundance and taxonomic analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles in the infected groups. Increased plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and zonulin were detected in patient samples. Some genera were elevated during acute infection, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia-Shigella were associated with increased zonulin levels, indicating compromised intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the gut–lung axis and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota could support immune regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Understanding the intricacies of the host inflammatory response to coronaviruses is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severe consequences of these infections. Various coronaviruses can trigger the host immune response, leading to highly similar inflammatory reactions. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to the same group of beta-coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2 and induces high pathogenicity in mice, typically serves as a safety model for investigating highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, replication, and virus-host interactions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) infected with MHV. Results We characterized the global gene changes at both the mRNA and protein levels following viral infection, identifying ten genes involved in various anti-MHV biological processes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with relevant published data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells, we observed significant similarities in the responses to MHV and SARS-CoV-2, particularly regarding immune and inflammatory responses. Discussion These findings underscore how our research enhances the understanding of global gene expression alterations during coronavirus infection and facilitates the identification of novel antiviral targets.">

        <tr id="Influenza remains a global health threat, infecting approximately one billion people annually and causing significant mortality, particularly among older adults. While hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers are a standard correlate of immunity against influenza, they do not reliably predict protection in high-risk populations. Using multiomic single-cell profiling, we identified a distinct subset of adaptive-like NK cells that respond to influenza antigen, predominantly in younger females. These TNFSF10+LGALS9+ NK cells exhibit features of adaptive NK cells but lack classical cytomegalovirus-driven markers observed in previous studies. Notably, their increased frequency correlates with high pre-existing HAI titers, suggesting a link between adaptive-like NK responses and humoral immunity. Together, our findings identify an NK subset influenced by age and sex that may contribute to influenza protection, expanding the known diversity of adaptive-like NK cells. These insights could inform future vaccine strategies, particularly for aging populations, by integrating NK responses into assessments of vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) represent one of the most susceptible populations for developing severe COVID-19, and a unique human genetic condition for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility of neurologically vulnerable individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human Chromosome-21 (HSA21) triplication in DS causes global transcriptional deregulation, affecting multiple genes that may directly (e.g., TMPRSS2) or indirectly influence the SARS-CoV-2 entry into central nervous system (CNS) cells. The anti-viral immune response may also be altered in cells with trisomy-21 (T21) due to triplication of genes encoding for several interferon receptor subunits and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we demonstrate that human cells derived from fetal cortical specimens and maintained in primary cultures are susceptible to infection with a molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and to authentic SARS-CoV-2. The level of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cultures originated from different cortical specimens varied, seemingly depending on ploidy and chromosomal sex of the cells. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cultures and found that XY T21 group had the highest TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, which was associated with increased infectivity in XY—compared to XX T21 cultures. The XX T21 cultures exhibited elevated expression of several ISGs (MX1, STAT1, and STAT2) which was associated with lower infectivity. The comparisons of postmortem aged brain specimens revealed reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, but elevated STAT2 protein levels in individuals with DS and Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD) compared to control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. Collectively, these results suggest multifactorial regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cortical cells that involves ploidy, chromosomal sex, and the expression of genes implicated in regulation of virus entry and anti-viral response as contributing factors.

        <tr id="Background Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder often accompanied by leukoderma and leukotrichia. Half of vitiligo patients experience episodes of stress. Methods We established a chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS) model in C57BL/6 J mice to simulate chronic mental stress-induced leukoderma and leukotrichia. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to determine the immune landscape and to characterize the relationship between immune-stromal cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed for validation. Results We discovered a similar pro-inflammatory micro-environment composed of keratinocytes and fibroblasts similar to that in human vitiligo. Macrophages in CUMS mice expressed high levels of inflammatory factors and were inclined to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Two distinct clusters of melanocytes were also identified: Mel2, defined as melanocyte stem cells, and Mel3, defined as mature melanocytes. Mel2 cells were prone to pyroptosis and necroptosis, while Mel3 cells were susceptible to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. Compared with control mice, higher expression of CXCL16 on dendritic cells and of the CXCL16 ligand, CXCR6, on γδT cells were observed in leukoderma. Dendritic cells and natural killer T cells in the CUMS mouse spleen exhibited elevated levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6, respectively. Activation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis and a non-specific immune response in our CUMS model might imitate chronic mental stress-induced vitiligo in humans better than CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated models. Conclusions We discovered two melanocyte clusters with distinct fates and a pro-inflammatory micro-environment with CXCL16–CXCR6 axis activation of antigen-presenting cells and other innate immunocytes that might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of stress-induced vitiligo.

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 is an increasing problem after COVID-19 disease. The pathogenesis of this persistent post Covid-19 Condition (PCC) is, however, largely unknown. We hypothesized that persistent T cell activation and exhaustion play a role in PCC development. Methods We examined plasma levels of soluble (s) CD25, TIM-3 and LAG-3, all markers of T cell activation/exhaustion, by enzyme immunoassays in 170 home-isolated and 53 hospitalized patients for up to 18 months after COVID-19 in relation to persistent symptomatology. Results Our major findings were: (i) Cases with persistent dyspnea and fatigue had markedly higher sCD25 at 6–18 months with a more modest increase in sTIM-3. (ii) Cases with memory problems at 12–18 months had increased sLAG-3 iii) sCD25 correlated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and microneutralization titers only in cases with PCC while sTIM-3 correlated with these parameters irrespectively of symptoms. iv) Although hospitalized patients had markedly elevated levels of T cell activation/exhausting markers during follow-up, there was no relation to PCC symptoms. Conclusion Our study indicates a role for T cell activation/exhaustion in PCC following home isolated COVID-19 infection, with somewhat different patterns of sCD25, sTIM-3 and sLAG-3, but not in hospitalized COVID-19 patients where disease severity may be more important.">

        <tr id="Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) has been extensively used in clinical treatments during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades host cells via its spike (S) protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane, mediating viral-host membrane fusion. Blocking viral entry is a crucial step in preventing infection, with the interaction between the S receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 being a key antiviral target. Given that SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the respiratory system and approximately 25% of patients suffering from corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with gastrointestinal symptoms, we are committed to identifying more active ingredients in QFPDD that target the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of COVID-19 patients. Among medicinal plants, ephedra and liquorice derived from QFPDD, along with two other Chinese herbs, Platycodon grandiflorum and Radix Rhei Et Rhizome (rhubarb), have garnered our interest. These herbs have historically been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treating infectious diseases with respiratory and digestive symptoms. Here, we established a library containing all components of the four individual herbs gathered from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and performed structure-based virtual screening to identify potential ACE2/S-RBD inhibitors. Subsequently, we selected 10 ingredients from the top 30 candidates and evaluated their activities using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Delphinidin and deapio platycodin D (DPD) showed significant antiviral potential with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 45.35 µM and 1.38 µM, respectively. Furthermore, delphinidin also inhibited the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), indicating its dual-viral target inhibitory potential. Notably, DPD effectively suppressed HCoV-229E replication in BEL-7402 cells. This study not only provides a strategy for rapid identifying antiviral agents from TCM in anticipation of future pandemics but also offers theoretical and experimental evidence to support for the clinical use of QFPDD.

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with increased risks of neurological and psychiatric sequelae. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is ubiquitous in human genes, resulting in mRNA diversity, and has been validated to play a pivotal regulatory role in the onset and progression of a variety of diseases, including viral infections. Here, we analyzed the APA usage across different cell types in frontal cortex cells from non-viral control group and COVID-19 patients, and identified functionally related APA events in COVID-19. According to our study, the poly(A) site (PAS) usage is different among cell types and following SARS-COV-2 infection. Moreover, we found the genes with significant PAS level changes affected pathways related to RNA splicing, and neuronal development and function, suggesting that survivors of COVID-19 will have a high risk of these diseases and that alternative splicing functions cause these changes. Additionally, APA usage and its correlation with gene expression levels varied across genes, some prefer short isoform that is more stable to produce more proteins, while others may be regulated by different mechanisms. A total of 267 risk genes targeted by microRNAs for common neurological and psychiatric disorders were found to undergo significant changes in APA following infection. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of APA in neural cells from COVID-19 patients at the single-cell level elucidated changes in APA levels in the brains of SARS-COV-2-infected patients and confirmed that these changes impair the function of the nervous system, providing important insights for COVID-19-associated sequelae. Highlights We analyzed the changes in single-cell APA level in the frontal cortex after SARS-COV-2 infection and found that PAS usage is different among cell types and changed after infection. We find that APA changes are related to RNA splicing, and neuronal development and function, such as synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, learning or memory and cognition, and the brain function may be impaired due to global gene expression and APA changes. A total of 267 risk genes for common neurological and psychiatric disorders were found to undergo significant changes in APA following infection, implying that APA alterations in specific genes could be a potential therapeutic target and predictive biomarker for neurological and psychiatric disease. APA in infection samples results in the removal/addition of miRNA target sites in the 3′-UTR of genes. A total of 2404 miRNAs were predicted which suggests that the miRNAs’ target site information can indicate the impact of APA events and has the potential to be used as a predictive biomarker.">

        <tr id="Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.

        <tr id="Chagas disease (CD) is endemic in Latin America, with its pathogenesis linked to Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) persistence and autoimmune responses. This study investigates the role of LINE-1 (L1) activation in inflammation and loss of self-tolerance during Tc infection. In vitro assays evaluated the expression of genes involved in L1 regulation and interferon signaling under basal conditions and following L1 suppression via CRISPR/dCas9. In vivo analyses in a murine model included L1 and IFN expression profiling, autoantibody quantification, and histopathological assessments of liver, spleen, intestine, and heart. Tc infection induced L1 upregulation, correlating with an increased expression of its inhibitors, MOV-10 and APOBEC-3, suggesting host-driven regulatory mechanisms. L1 activation was also associated with the upregulation of DNA repair pathways (MMR and NHEJ) and RNA-sensing pathways (MDA-5 and RIG-I), leading to type I interferon responses. In the murine model, L1 expression was highest in the intestine and heart, independent of parasite burden, and correlated with increased interferon gene expression and autoantibody production. Our findings suggest that CD pathogenesis involves L1-induced chronic inflammation, which may contribute to late-stage symptoms. This highlights self-recognition mechanisms in disease severity and reveals potential therapeutic targets for novel treatments.">

This review discusses the role of microglia in neuroinflammation, tissue repair, and neural homeostasis, as well as their involvement in MS and explores potential therapeutic strategies targeting microglial function. Methods A literature search conducted in August 2023 and updated in March 2025, using the PubMed database, focused on articles relating to microglia and MS published in 2018–2025. Additionally, ongoing clinical trials of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors were identified through the ClinicalTrials.gov website in November 2023 and updated in March 2025. Results Microglia are highly adaptive and exhibit various functional states throughout different life stages and play critical roles in neuroinflammation, tissue repair, and neural homeostasis. Their altered activity is a prominent feature of MS, contributing to its pathogenesis. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide insights into microglial activity in MS. BTK inhibitors and other novel treatments for MS, including masitinib and frexalimab, show promise in modulating microglial function and influencing the disease progression rate. Conclusions The multifaceted roles of microglia in CNS development, immune surveillance, and particularly in the pathogenesis of MS highlight the potential of targeting microglial functions in MS treatment. Emerging research on the involvement of microglia in MS pathophysiology offers promising avenues for developing novel therapies, especially for progressive MS, potentially improving patient outcomes in this debilitating disease.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes infiltrate the CNS in response to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection and form a pool of long-lived brain tissue-resident memory T-cells (bTRMs), which display markers of residency (i.e., CD103, CD69, CD49a). However, the functional role of these bTRMs is still unknown. By 30 days postinfection, a latent viral brain infection was established, as indicated by absence of viral transcripts (IE1, E1, and gB) produced during productive infection. Following intracerebroventricular injection of either depleting α-CD8 Ab (clone YTS169.4) or α-CD103-sap (clone IT50) into the brain, 90–95% T-cell depletion was achieved. Using luciferase-expressing mice, we observed recommenced imaging signals indicative of de novo MCMV IE promoter activity in depleted animals. Surprisingly, using an explant assay, we efficiently recovered reactivatable, infectious virus from untreated, latent animals, but not from those depleted of bTRMs (viral recovery in explants was reduced from 100% to 50% by day 21). We identified Lgals3 (galectin 3), Gpnmb (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) and Hmox1 (heme oxygenase 1) as genes that were most upregulated in bTRM-depleted groups. When bTRMs were depleted, there was transient expression of viral IE genes which resulted in antiviral microglia with a phagocytic, disease-associated (DAM) or neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype. These data provide new insights into the role of bTRMs in controlling both CNS reactivation and driving microglial phenotypes.">

        <tr id="In the last 2 years, there has been an increasing concern that SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a marker of undiagnosed cancers. A potential connection between COVID-19/long COVID and malignant transformation/cancer progression was reported in a number of studies. It is, however, unclear if the virus itself can cause malignant transformation or if it has a potential to support malignant processes in human body. We analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs collected from individuals infected with Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and conducted in vitro studies using BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells. Here we report that Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein induce activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex in infected cells. This effect is achieved through conversion of cellular 2-oxoglutarate into 2-hydroxy-glutarate, which most likely blocks the activity of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation. As such, it leads to activation of HIF-1, which triggers production of transforming growth factor–β type 1 (TGF-β). TGF-β induces expression of immune checkpoint proteins, such as galectin-9, programmed death-ligand 1, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme, which is involved in production of immunosuppressive amino acid called L-kynurenine. These immune checkpoint pathways were capable of suppressing both helper and cytotoxic activities of T lymphocytes and, as such, could potentially support malignant processes in infected tissues.">

        <tr id="Lead exposure is of high prevalence, and over a billion people are chronically exposed to alarming level of lead. Human immune system is highly vulnerable to lead, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Using single-cell mass cytometry and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we performed a panoramic survey of lead targets at both cellular and molecular levels in murine immune system upon chronic lead exposure. We produced a single-cell landscape of lead, thiol metabolism and lead-induced toxicity across all immune cell types. We found that immune cells with extreme thiol metabolism are the most sensitive upon chronic lead exposure. It shows that CD4 + T cells and neutrophils are the most sensitive to lead, which is due respectively to a molecular mechanism rooted in their characteristic thiol metabolic capacity. Meanwhile, we found that lead accumulation by RBC further inflicted secondary toxicity to RBC phagocytes in spleen, e.g. macrophages and neutrophils. Unlike CD4 + T cells, which can be rescued by supplementation with thiol chelator, lead toxicity in these phagocytes cannot be effectively mitigated by thiol chelators. Overall, it forms a multiscale panoramic lead-immune system interactome upon chronic lead exposure, which provides valuable information for proactive prevention, therapy formulation and public health evaluation. Graphical abstract Graphical headlights Established a lead-immune system interactome across cellular and molecular level. Thiol metabolic heterogeneity leads to diversified molecular mechanisms of toxicity in different immune cells. Thiol chelator can only mitigate lead toxicity in CD4 + T cells but not splenic RBC phagocytes. PKC-like, PE/DAG-binding proteins are potential targets of immune activation retardation upon lead exposure.

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks following acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, but chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and viral persistence are increasingly being implicated. This study investigated the immunopathological drivers of long COVID-19 and their associations with clinical manifestations and organ damage. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-65 years, in which immune markers, autoantibody profiles, lymphocyte dysfunction, and imaging findings were assessed over a 12-month period. Persistent inflammation was observed, with elevated interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α ± levels correlated with lung fibrosis and cognitive impairment. Autoantibodies were detected in 40% of the participants, particularly those with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. A significant reduction in CD8+ T-cell counts was associated with severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, whereas persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 10% of cases, primarily in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms. Imaging studies revealed multiorgan involvement, with structural abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and brain. These findings highlight the interplay of immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity in long-term COVID-19, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address its long-term health impacts.">

        <tr id="A series of hyper immune responses as combined reaction of innate and adaptive immunity may lead to cytokine storm prolonging sickness and causing severities among patients of respiratory infection in general and attack COVID-19 patients in particular. We measured the levels of inflammatory cytokines viz. TNF-alpha, Interleukin-6 and Interferon-gamma. The initiation of immune system against viral infection involves role of cytokines. In Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, high levels of cytokine were observed which led to severity in immune-compromised patients, elderly and even mildly infected patients. High levels of cytokines have not only been observed in SARS-CoV-2 but are also prevalent in other human coronavirus infections. There are other respiratory diseases occurring in the form of epidemics and outbreaks in all parts of the world, yet understanding of the fact that when system gets infected by more than one respiratory virus, the cytokine expression observed has not been looked upon.

This is irrespective of the fact that antibodies may already be present against respiratory diseases within the system over the course of time. We hereby hypothesise that if cytokine storm due to such condition may lead to activation of Th1/Th2 response, develop severity/complications and ultimately may lead to lung damage. In this study, we measured the cytokine response profiles (TNF-alpha, interleukin-6 and IFN-gamma) in patients with respiratory viral infections and we observed that TNF-α is the main factor contributing to cytokine storm and that hyper innate immune response is brought by mucosal immunity during infection by SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The global immune landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has progressively shifted from a naïve population several years ago to a population that possesses immunity to the virus through infection, vaccination, or a combination of both, known as hybrid immunity. Hybrid immunity offers a prolonged period of transmission-blocking activity, likely related to enhanced tissue-resident immunity, but also has been shown to be linked to broader humoral and cellular immune responses. Compared with vaccination or infection alone, the collective data have demonstrated that hybrid immunity offers enhanced protection against disease. Yet, despite the benefits of hybrid immunity, perpetual evolution of variants and the natural waning of immunity in vulnerable populations provides a strong rationale for revaccination. This article reviews the benefits of revaccination, including updating variant-specific immunity, bolstering humoral and cellular immune frequencies in those with hybrid immunity, and overcoming immune imprinting and enhancing effector mechanisms to raise surveillance and defense against the virus. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, updated booster vaccinations remain essential to enhance and sustain protection from disease by ensuring that the immune system is equipped to respond to contemporary strains, thereby reducing the impact of future outbreaks and mitigating the burden of COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations.">

        <tr id="Although COVID-19 was originally considered a respiratory illness, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have far-reaching impacts on the nervous system. Neurological symptoms such as chemosensory dysfunction are frequently observed during acute infection and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases will go on to develop new or persistent long-term symptoms, a condition known in the literature as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) or by the patient-coined term Long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The emergence of Long COVID has prompted renewed interest in the study of post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly in the area of neuroimmune interactions. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of literature on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, with an emphasis on neuroimmune mechanisms drawn largely from autopsy studies and animal models. A more complete understanding of neuroimmune crosstalk in Long COVID will not only guide the development of therapies for this highly disabling condition but will also contribute to our general understanding of neuroimmune interactions in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Several years after the COVID‐19 pandemic, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immunity and the potential protective role of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination through trained immunity remain a subject of investigation. This study aimed to determine the long‐term impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immune cells and the association between BCG vaccination, latent infections and COVID‐19 severity and sepsis progression. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of patients who recovered from mild/severe/critical COVID‐19 (n = 97, 3–17 months after COVID‐19) and sepsis patients (n = 64). First, we assessed the impact of COVID‐19 and its severity on immune cell frequencies and expression of functional markers. Further, we analysed plasma titres of anti‐Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies and their association with COVID‐19 severity and sepsis outcome. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID‐19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐2 and LPS. Results Post‐COVID‐19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterised by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post‐critical COVID‐19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. A trend toward improved outcomes in BCG‐seropositive COVID‐19/sepsis patients was observed, although this may be confounded by age differences between groups. In contrast, the monocyte response to stimulation appeared unaffected by COVID‐19 severity. Conclusion These findings highlight the long‐term alterations of immune cells in post‐COVID‐19 patients, emphasising the substantial impact of COVID‐19 on immune function.">

        <tr id="Introduction There are significant challenges remain in accurately categorizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. Objectives We used an untargeted 1H NMR-based metabolomics to assess the metabolomic changes in serum samples from a Danish cohort of 106 COVID-19-infected patients with mild to fatal disease courses and from patients with fatal outcomes from other diseases. Methods In total, 240 serum samples were used for this study. We used the data for multiple analyses (1) to construct a predictive model for disease severity and outcome, (2) to identify prognostic markers for subsequent disease severity and outcome, and (3) to understand the disease consequences in the metabolome and how recovery or death is reflected in the altered biological pathways. Results Our results revealed distinct alterations in the serum metabolome that could differentiate patients with COVID-19 by severity (mild or severe) or outcome (death or survival). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and four machine learning algorithms (random forest, linear support vector machine, PLS-DA, and logistic regression), we identified two biomarker sets with relevant biological functions that predict subsequent disease severity and patient outcome. The range of these severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and included inflammatory markers, amino acids, fluid balance, ketone bodies, glycolysis-related metabolites, lipoprotein particles, and fatty acid levels. Conclusions Our data suggest the potential benefits of broader testing of these metabolites from newly diagnosed patients to predict which COVID-19 patients will progress to severe disease and which patients will manifest severe symptoms to minimize mortality.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been linked to long-term neurological effects with multifaceted complications of neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have found that pathological changes in transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) are involved in these cases. This review explores the causal interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and TDP-43 from multiple perspectives. Some viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to induce pathological changes in TDP-43 through its cleavage, aggregation, and mislocalization. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause liquid−liquid phase separation and stress granule formation, which accelerate the condensation of TDP-43, resulting in host RNA metabolism disruption. TDP-43 has been proposed to interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, though its role in viral replication remains to be fully elucidated. This interaction potentially facilitates viral replication, while viral-induced oxidative stress and protease activity accelerate TDP-43 pathology. Evidence from both clinical and experimental studies indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to long-term neurological sequelae, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like and frontotemporal dementia-like features, as well as increased phosphorylated TDP-43 deposition in the central nervous system. Biomarker studies further support the link between TDP-43 dysregulation and neurological complications of long-term effects of COVID-19 (long COVID). In this review, we presented a novel integrative framework of TDP-43 pathology, bridging a gap between SARS-CoV-2 infection and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. These findings underscore the need for further research to clarify the TDP-43-related neurodegeneration underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and to develop therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating long-term neurological effects in patients with long COVID.">

Small-scale molecular interactions have been analyzed by focusing on several genes/single genes, providing important insights; however, genome-wide multi-omics comprehensive molecular interactions have not yet been well investigated with the exception of GWAS and eQTLm, both of which show genetic risks. From April of 2020 until now, we have created a Japan-wide system, initially named the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. This system has collected more than 6500 COVID-19 patients’ peripheral blood and as much associated clinical information as possible from a network of more than 120 hospitals. DNA, RNA, serum, and plasma were extracted and stored in this bank. This study unravels the interplay of inflammatory gene networks that induce different COVID-19 severity levels (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) by using multi-omics data from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. We analyze RNA and protein expressions to estimate severity-specific inflammation networks that uncover the interplay between RNA and protein networks via ligand–receptor pairs. Our large-scale RNA/protein expression data analysis reveals that the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) acts as a key broker linking RNA and protein inflammation networks to induce COVID-19 critical severity. ACKR2 emerges in RNA and protein inflammation networks, showing active interplay in high-severity cases and weak interactions in mild cases. The results also show severity-specific molecular interactions between interleukin (IL), cytokine receptor activity, cell adhesion, and interactions involving the CC chemokine ligand (CCL) gene family and ACKR2.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 776 million confirmed cases and more than 7 million deaths worldwide. In addition to humans, various animal species have exhibited natural infections, with mink being the only farmed animals consistently linked to severe illness and zoonotic transmission to humans. This study investigates histological pulmonary lesions in Danish farm mink infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), focusing on groups with different clinical signs and outcomes. Results Histopathological evaluations revealed lesions in SARS-CoV-2-positive mink with and without clinical signs of disease. The main findings in lungs from SARS-CoV-2-positive mink in all study groups were extensive respiratory epithelial damage, acute diffuse alveolar damage, and vascular lesions, including the formation of thrombi. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of viral particles primarily in the respiratory epithelia. Lymphoid cells exhibited nodular and perivascular aggregates similar to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in older SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected mink, indicating a potential age-related feature of mink lungs. Conclusions The presence of subclinical and long-term pulmonary lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in farm mink suggests that the impact of outbreaks may be more serious than clinical signs records indicate. The current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance system on Danish mink farms does not properly address such problems and repeated outbreaks on farms could occur without detection if there are no clinical signs or increased mortality due to SARS-CoV-2. The severity of subclinical lesions reveals hidden health and welfare challenges in mink, underscoring the need for improved prevention measures, surveillance and understanding of long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink.

        <tr id="Recent research has proposed several host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection and involved in the inflammatory response. Among these, members of the human serpin family and PAR2 have been suggested to play a relevant role. As it has been shown that one of the multiple activities of protease inhibitor SerpinB3 is the activation of PAR2, we have modulated the expression of these two molecules on both human bronchial and hepatic cells and assessed cell surface Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our findings indicate that both SerpinB3 and PAR2 play a pivotal role in viral infection and downregulate the expression of interferon-γ, a cytokine with a well-known antiviral effect. These results underscore the potential of the SerpinB3-PAR2 axis as a target for antiviral therapy and provide support for addressing serpins as targets for this purpose.">

        <tr id="In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequence which ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular impact of sepsis remains rudimentary. Methods A mouse sepsis model was established through LPS induction and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect T helper 1 (Th1) cell subsets and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Additionally, in vivo neutralization experiments were conducted to block IFN-γ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, to explore the regulatory effect of DOCK2 on septic mice. Finally, the regulatory mechanism of DOCK2 was analyzed using an in vivo RNA-seq system. Results We identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. DOCK2-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced sepsis and E. coli sepsis with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-γ which were mainly due to hyperresponsive Th1 cells. Ulteriorly, we verified the vital role of DOCK2-mediated Th1 cells in sepsis by neutralizing both IFN-γ and CD4 and found both of which blockade reduced the severity of sepsis in Dock2−/− mice. Mechanically, DOCK2-mediated cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to govern peripheral Th1 cell fate. Conclusion Our data indicates that DOCK2 acts as a protective role in regulating systemic inflammation and multi-organ injury in bacterial sepsis by constraining Th1 response. These findings provide new targets for immunomodulatory therapy of sepsis, suggesting that targeting the DOCK2-Th1 axis may become a new strategy to improve systemic inflammatory responses associated with bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a period of non-motor symptoms, including gastrointestinal dysfunction, preceding motor deficits by several years to decades. This long prodrome is suggestive of peripheral immunity involvement in the initiation of disease. We previously developed a model system in PINK1 KO mice displaying PD-like motor symptoms at late stages following intestinal infections. Herein, we map the initiating immune events at the site of infection in this model. Using single-cell RNAseq, we demonstrate that peripheral myeloid cells are the earliest highly dysregulated immune cell type followed by an aberrant T cell response shortly after. We also demonstrate an increased propensity for antigen presentation and that activated myeloid cells acquire a proinflammatory profile capable of inducing cytotoxic T cell responses. Together, our study provides the first evidence that PINK1 is a key regulator of immune functions in the gut underlying early PD-related disease mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Current vaccines rely on the sequence of Spike (S) protein to induce immunity against the severe acute respiratory coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus. Because of the high mutation rate of the viral S protein, new mutant strains are developed to generate new infectivity profiles. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are synthesized on demand to sustain homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to determine the action of selected LMs in the viral replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 variant in human lung and nasal epithelial cells. Cells from healthy donors were infected with Omicron BA.5 for one hour and treated with 500 nM Elovanoid (ELV)‐N32, ELV‐N34, Resolvin D6 isomer (RvD6i), Neuroprotection D1 (NPD1), or vehicle before and after infection. Impedance was recorded to determine cell death by infectivity. Cells were then immunostained for nucleocapsid (N) protein, microtubule‐associated protein 1B‐light chain 3 (LC3B), and autophagic proteins. N and S RNA were measured to assess the synthesis of viral components. The addition of ELV‐N34 or RvD6i decreased the synthesis of N RNA by 76.7% and 96.9%, respectively, in lung primary culture, while NPD1 exerted the same effect in nasal epithelial cells (61.7% reduction). In lung cells, transcription of autophagy‐related gene‐3 (ATG3) and Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), components of the autophagy initiation process, decreased compared to the non‐treated infected cells. The results suggest that specific LMs prevent viral autophagy machinery hijacking, leading to a decrease in BA.5 replication. This novel effect of the bioactive LMs as antivirals, regardless of the protein sequence, would potentially complement vaccination and other prevention and treatment therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV) patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram, Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month 6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent role in the later stages.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) strains mutate rapidly, making it crucial to study their molecular mechanisms for swift vaccine and drug development. Here, we utilized host lung proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling to investigate the underlying pathology caused by the variants. Lung tissues infected with wild‐type GD108, Delta, or Omicron BA.1 variants showed overexpression of proteins and phosphoproteins linked to the innate immune pathway, particularly in the Omicron group, with high activation of NOD‐receptor and RIG‐I like receptor signaling pathways. Protein‐protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed six key proteins, including antiviral innate immune response receptor RIG‐I (DDX58), and five interferon‐related proteins (IFIT2, ISG15, MX1, STAT1, and EIF2AK2), highlighting the importance of the innate immune response in combating all three variants. Kinase prediction analysis suggested that six kinases (DAPK1, DAPK2, DAPK3, PRACK, TTK, and MAP2K2), potentially inhibited by Fostamatinib, were activated across all three variants, and might be potential drug targets, pending further verification. Omicron infection, compared to other mutants, significantly disrupted proteins related to pulmonary structural support, like integrin and collagens, and inhibited efferocytosis, reducing the host's ability to eliminate the pathogen. These findings suggest that innate immune activation and structural disruption may contribute to Omicron‐related pathology, potentially being useful for research into the molecular mechanisms underlying lung injury from SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.">

        <tr id="A liver involvement in Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID‐19) has been frequently observed in patients hospitalised for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection during 2020; in such cases, the clinical and prognostic relevance of hepatocellular damage has been widely acknowledged. On the other hand, there is less extensive evidence of liver injury (LI) in the subsequent waves of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of LI and to determine the clinical, biochemical, and immune‐virologic characteristics associated with its development in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients hospitalised in 2021–2022. This single‐centre retrospective study included 455 patients with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and respiratory failure. LI was defined by the detection of transaminase levels exceeding three times the upper limit of normality (ULN) and was further classified as early or late liver injury based on whether the peak transaminase value occurred within or after 7 days from hospital admission. LI was found in 17.6% (80/455) of the overall cohort, while early liver injury (ELI) and late liver injury (LLI) were detected in 10.4% and 11.5%, respectively. LI was associated with younger age, elevated inflammatory and tissue damage markers, with the presence of chronic liver disease (CLD), and with the use of interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) inhibitors. Patients with LI had a higher probability of severe COVID‐19, transfer to intensive care unit, and in‐hospital death than those without. In multivariable analysis, younger age, administration of IL‐6 inhibitors, and the presence of higher gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) levels were independently related to the development of overall LI, whereas in‐hospital mortality was independently correlated with the occurrence of LLI. The occurrence of hepatocellular damage therefore has been associated with a pro‐inflammatory profile and with worse overall outcomes but not with increased likelihood of liver failure or liver‐related mortality.">

        <tr id="Background Defining the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is critical for informing the management of reinfections, vaccinations, and therapeutics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Using four antibody assays, we evaluated antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and receptor binding domain (RBD) in 98 convalescent participants with varying COVID-19 disease severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe) at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months post-SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR and in 17 non-vaccinated, non-infected controls. Results Increasing acute COVID-19 disease severity correlates with higher anti-N and anti-RBD titers throughout 12 months post-infection. Anti-N and anti-RBD titers decline over time in all participants, except for increased anti-RBD titers post-vaccination, with hospitalized participants exhibiting faster decay rates. Less than 50% of participants retain anti-N titers above controls at 12 months, with non-hospitalized participants falling below controls sooner. Nearly all participants maintain anti-RBD titers above controls for 12 months, suggesting long-term protection against severe reinfections. Nonetheless, by 6 months, few participants retain >50% of their initial 1-month anti-N or anti-RBD titers. Notably, vaccine-induced anti-RBD titers are higher in non-hospitalized participants. Lastly, early convalescent titers correlate with age but not with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) status or steroid use. Conclusion Hospitalized participants initially develop higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that decline faster relative to non-hospitalized participants. While anti-N titers fall below control levels in some participants, anti-RBD titers remain above controls over 12 months, demonstrating long-lived antibody responses known to protect against severe disease. These findings advance our understanding of COVID-19 antibody dynamics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global health crisis, with many patients experiencing not only acute neurological and sensory symptoms but also persistent sensory abnormalities, commonly referred to as long COVID sequelae. The mechanisms underlying somatosensory abnormalities induced by SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigate the role of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein in pain regulation. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 N protein exacerbates pathological pain in mouse models of bone cancer, chemotherapy, neuropathic, and inflammatory, and promotes the chronification of acute inflammatory pain. We also identify a potential interaction between the N protein and Nav1.7 in dorsal root ganglion neurons from mice, monkeys, and humans. Furthermore, the N protein significantly increases Nav1.7 currents in dorsal root ganglion neurons from both mice and monkeys by delaying Nav1.7 inactivation without altering its expression or membrane trafficking. This modulation of Nav1.7 function by the N protein not only intensifies pain hypersensitivity but also prolongs the duration of pain, potentially facilitating the transition from acute to chronic pain. Our findings underscore the importance of vigilant management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with pathological pain and suggest potential therapeutic targets for mitigating COVID-19-related pain.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has a diverse spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe and critical cases that result in the death of the patient. Alongside the viral factors host factors like Age, deregulation of the immune response and presence of comorbidity determine the patient’s outcome. Here we sought to assess the impact of age on natural antibody response, CBC-based inflammatory markers, and outcome of COVID-19 patients. We divided the participants into three groups, young (≤ 35 years), middle-aged (40–60 years), and old (≥ 65 years) patients and collected and analyzed sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. We found that elderly patients showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of inflammation like increased neutrophil percentages, NLR, lymphopenia, and low Hgb levels, compared to middle-aged and young patients. Interestingly these markers were also associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in ion concentration, lipid profile, and coagulation test between the three age groups. We also found that elderly patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased levels of natural antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the two groups. Lastly, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone treatment, even if statistically not significant (P > 0.05) we observed a positive trend among patients under dexamethasone in the aspect of decreasing inflammatory markers. To conclude we showed that SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by an age-dependent deregulation of inflammatory markers that are associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Life-threatening severe dengue (SD) develops in a small subset of patients suffering from dengue fever (DF), a febrile disease that develops following infection with dengue virus (DENV). DENV is a mosquito-borne positive -sense RNA virus. The rapid spread of DENV vectors, which was exacerbated by climate change and inadequate control measures, has led to outbreaks affecting millions worldwide. There is no specific treatment for DF, and the recently introduced vaccines are ineffective in containing the current outbreaks. Like many other viral diseases, the immune system plays a key role in dengue pathogenesis. The lack of models replicating the disease’s immunopathological features has hampered the understanding of the immune system’s role in developing this disease. Recent advances, such as single-cell approaches, provide better systems and methodologies to study the role of different immune cells in SD, closing this gap and providing a better mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis and promoting the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions. Here, we summarize recent advances in SD research, focusing on immune cell interactions and their role in disease severity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) pathology involves complex immune responses within granulomatous lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cellular compositions of necrotizing granulomatous lesions that developed in the lungs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We identified 11 distinct major cell types, including phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, and T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among T cells, particularly, Pdcd1⁺ γδ T cells were detected in necrotizing granulomatous lesions, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Within the macrophage populations, we identified a cluster with significantly higher Plin2 expression compared to other clusters, whose transcriptomic profile was consistent with that of foamy macrophages. A subset of the Plin2-expressing macrophages was identified as a major source of Ifnb1 and Cxcl1, suggesting their involvement in type I interferon signaling and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, we identified Flrt2, Hyal1, and Mmp13 as novel molecular markers of Plin2-expressing macrophages, which were localized to the peripheral rim regions of necrotizing granulomas. In conclusion, our results provide the immune landscape of necrotizing granulomas and reveal novel functional states of macrophages contributing to TB pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Introduction Microvascular injury is central to the pathophysiology of sepsis, but its interaction with the immune system in early infection is unclear. This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

Clustering analysis using the K-prototypes method identified underlying biological patterns in patients with COVID-19. The penalized multinomial logistic regression analysis identified two comorbidities (hypertension, congestive heart failure) and thirteen analytes as potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression with 88.2% accuracy. Based on a patient’s age, high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and pentraxin 3 were important biomarkers for lethal COVID-19. Decreased concentrations of interferon gamma-induced protein-10, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I were found to be associated with mild COVID-19, while increasing concentrations of these analytes could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.">

        <tr id="The pathology of severe COVID-19 is due to a hyperinflammatory immune response persisting after viral clearance. To understand how the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is regulated to avoid severe COVID-19, we tested relevant immunoregulatory cytokines. TGF-β, IL-10 and IL-4 were neutralized upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (CMA3p20), a model of mild disease; and lung inflammation was quantified by histology and flow cytometry at early and late time points. Mild weight loss, and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 days post-infection (dpi) and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-β, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer. Anti-IL-4 reduced expression of Arg1, a gene associated with alternative activation of macrophages. Neutralizing TGF-β and IL-4 had differential effects on pathology after virus control. Lung perivascular infiltration was reduced 7 dpi by neutralization of IL-4 or TGF-β, and peri-airway inflammation was affected by anti-TGF-β, while alveolar infiltrates were not affected by either. Anti-IL-4 prolonged IL-12 to 7 dpi along with reduced IL-10 in lungs. Overall, the immunoregulatory cytokines TGF-β and IL-4 dampen initial inflammation in this maSARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that promotion of immunoregulation could help patients in early stages of disease.

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ−) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ− cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer’s Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global health crisis, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented unprecedented challenges to global healthcare systems, leading to rapid advances in treatment development. This review comprehensively examines the current therapeutic approaches for managing COVID-19, including direct-acting antivirals, immunomodulators, anticoagulants, and adjuvant therapies, as well as emerging and experimental approaches. Direct-acting antivirals target various stages of the viral life cycle, offering specific intervention points, while immunomodulators aim to modulate the host's immune response, reducing disease severity. Anticoagulant therapies address the coagulopathy frequently observed in severe cases, and adjuvant treatments provide supportive care to improve overall outcomes. We also explore the challenges and limitations of implementing these treatments, such as drug resistance, variable patient responses, and access to therapies, especially in resource-limited settings. The review also discusses future perspectives, including the potential of next-generation vaccines, personalized medicine, and global collaboration in shaping future COVID-19 treatment paradigms. Continuous innovation, combined with an integrated and adaptable approach, will be crucial to effectively managing COVID-19 and mitigating the impact of future pandemics.">

        <tr id="The interplay between comorbidities and viral infections is a critical factor that influences disease severity and outcomes. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one such comorbidity that significantly elevates the risk of severe viral infection from coronaviruses, namely, SARS-CoV-2. DM is characterized by either a lack of insulin production (type 1 diabetes) or insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), both of which contribute to a state of hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia significantly promotes chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, which put diabetics at an elevated risk of critical health outcomes. Additionally, diabetes is hypothesized to amplify viral titers during infection by promoting the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2 and providing a favorable cellular energy environment for viral replication. This review focuses on explaining the mechanisms that link diabetics with more severe COVID-19 disease and exploring some of the mechanisms that contribute to the phenomenon where COVID-19 can promote new-onset diabetes. By highlighting the interconnections between diabetes and COVID-19, this review aims to emphasize the implications that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has had on metabolic health.">

        <tr id="Abstract During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic a rare new paediatric inflammatory condition (paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS)/MIS-C) was identified which correlated with previous or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. PIMS-TS led to severe multiorgan inflammation, suggestive of disruption of central tolerance and thymus function. Here we investigated the possible role of the thymus in paediatric PIMS-TS. We confirmed that human thymus explants can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Comparison of T-cell populations in blood from PIMS-TS patients and age-matched healthy control children showed that although the overall proportions of CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations were decreased in PIMS-TS patients, the proportion of naïve cells in the CD4 population was higher in the PIMS-TS group. In PIMS-TS patients, the number of TREC in Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) correlated strongly with the proportion of naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells, whereas this correlation was not present in healthy children. Sequencing rearranged TCRβ and TCRɑ transcripts from FACS-sorted CD4+CD8-CD3+ and CD4-CD8+CD3+ from blood from PIMS-TS, healthy children, and additionally paediatric severe COVID-19 patients showed that while all three groups showed similar diversity and distribution, the repertoire of the PIMS-TS and COVID-19 groups had distinctive patterns of TCR gene segment usage and VJ combinatorial usage compared to healthy controls (TRBV11-2 × TRBJ2-7, TRBV11-2 × TRBJ1-1, TRBV11-2 × TRBJ2-5, TRBV11-2 × TRBJ2-1; TRBV29-1 × TRBJ2-7, TRBV29-1 × TRBJ1-1 enriched in PIMS-TS; TRBV7-9 × TRBJ1-2, TRAV9-2 × TRAJ30, and TRAV26-1 × TRAJ39 enriched in COVID-19). The non-productive TCR rearrangements in the PIMS-TS group were also enriched for TRBV11-2, and showed bias towards distal (5′TRAV to 3′TRAJ) TCRɑ gene segment usage, suggesting involvement of the thymus in PIMS-TS.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common non-infectious inflammatory CNS disease, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and focal demyelinated lesions. Traditionally considered an autoimmune disease, MS is driven by the immune system's attack on CNS myelin, resulting in cumulative disability. However, conventional anti-inflammatory treatments often fail to prevent progressive deterioration, particularly in the absence of overt inflammation, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis. Recent research has revealed a more complex disease mechanism involving both peripheral immune responses and intrinsic CNS factors, with glial cells playing a central role. Persistent inflammation in MS is associated with mixed active/inactive lesions dominated by microglia and astrocyte dysregulation. These glial populations exhibit maladaptive activation, contributing to failed remyelination and ongoing neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations as well as aging further exacerbate glial dysfunction, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of inflammation and damage. Emerging evidence suggests that the interplay between peripheral immune cells and glial populations and the potential dual-use nature of molecular tools shared by the immune system and CNS disrupts homeostatic signaling, leading to a loss of tissue integrity. This review synthesizes findings on glial cell biology in MS, with a focus on microglia and astrocytes, while addressing their roles in demyelination, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. The limitations of animal models, particularly EAE, in replicating the complexity of MS are also addressed. Finally, critical questions are outlined to guide future research into glial pathology and to identify novel therapeutic approaches targeting progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Introduction The H9N2 avian influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans. Methods This study investigated the effects of baicalin, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection. In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells, and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection. Results Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, helping to counteract the virus’s suppression of these defense proteins. In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier, baicalin has both antiviral and immune-regulating effects: it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2-infected mice. Most importantly, baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced. These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways (Mx1 and PKR) and restoring adaptive immune balance (CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio). Discussion These dual protective effects highlight baicalin’s potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine-resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2, contributing valuable insights into plant-derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats.">

        <tr id="Background Neuropathological and clinical studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the long-term risk of neurodegeneration. Methods We provide a narrative overview of pathological and clinical observations justifying the implementation of a surveillance program to monitor changes in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the years after COVID-19. Results Autopsy studies revealed diverse changes in the brain, including loss of vascular integrity, microthromboses, gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal- and glial injury and cell death, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals irrespective of the severity of COVID-19. Recent data suggest that microglia play an important role in sustained COVID-19-related inflammation, which contributes to the etiology initiating a neurodegenerative cascade, to the worsening of pre-existing neurodegenerative disease or to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Histopathological data have been supported by neuroimaging, and epidemiological studies also suggested a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases after COVID-19. Conclusions Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic, healthcare systems should be aware of, and be prepared for a potential increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the upcoming years. Strategies may include follow-up of well-described cohorts, analyses of outcomes in COVID-19-registries, nationwide surveillance programs using record-linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses, and comparing the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the post-pandemic periods to values of the pre-pandemic years. Awareness and active surveillance are particularly needed, because diverse clinical manifestations due to earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may no longer be quoted as post-COVID-19 symptoms, and hence, increasing incidence of neurodegenerative pathologies at the community level may remain unnoticed.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 presents with a distinct immunological profile, characterized by elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts, seen commonly in fungal and bacterial infections. This study demonstrates that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 show evidence of neutrophil degranulation and have increased expression of neutrophil surface lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), a marker of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). Both early LOX-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on neutrophils were associated with development of severe disease. To determine whether tissue damage or inflammation is required to induce PMN-MDSCs or whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly activates neutrophils to become PMN-MDSCs, we incubated healthy human neutrophils with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly induced LOX-1 surface expression in healthy neutrophils independent of productive infection. LOX-1 induction was dependent on granule exocytosis and promoted up-regulation of reactive oxygen species, CD63, and PD-L1, enabling LOX-1+ neutrophils to suppress autologous T cell proliferation in vitro. These results support a role for PMN-MDSCs in mediating severe COVID-19, and inhibition of PD-L1 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management.


METHODS
Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines.


RESULTS
The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY The mechanisms by which viruses enter host cells are crucial for their ability to infect and cause disease, serving as major targets for both host immune responses and therapeutic strategies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry process is primarily driven by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, in conjunction with the activity of endosomal cathepsin L and the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, recent scientific advances have expanded our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, uncovering alternative receptors and novel cofactors that may enhance viral tropism and adaptability. Given the critical role of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mediating host cell entry, it has become a primary target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. However, the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of S protein variants that may potentially confer a fitness advantage or modify key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, such as transmissibility, infectivity, antigenicity, and/or pathogenicity, posing significant challenges to the efficacy of current interventions. In this review, we provide an updated and comprehensive overview of the latest advances in SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways and molecular mechanisms, exploring their implications for antiviral drug discovery, vaccine design, and the development of other biomedical strategies while addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing evolution of the virus.">

        <tr id="Critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis exhibit distinct inflammatory phenotypes with divergent clinical outcomes and apparent heterogeneity of treatment effects, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. These phenotypes, derived from clinical data and protein biomarkers, were associated with metabolic differences in a prior pilot study. This study investigated the metabolomic and transcriptomic differences between Hyperinflammatory and Hypoinflammatory phenotypes through integrative multi-omics analysis of blood samples from ARDS patients in the ROSE trial. Multi-omics integration revealed three molecular signatures strongly associated with the Hyperinflammatory phenotype and with mortality: enhanced innate immune activation coupled with increased glycolysis, hepatic dysfunction and immune dysfunction paired with impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation, and interferon program suppression coupled with altered mitochondrial respiration. A fourth molecular signature, not associated with inflammatory phenotype, identified redox impairment and cell proliferation pathways associated with mortality. Integrated multi-omics analysis within each inflammatory phenotype revealed distinct pathways associated with mortality. All mortality-associated molecular signatures including those within phenotypes were validated in an independent cohort of critically ill patients with sepsis (EARLI). These findings reveal distinct molecular mechanisms underlying ARDS/sepsis phenotypes and suggest potential therapeutic targets for precise treatment strategies in critical illness.">

        <tr id="The incidence rate of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is rising. However, the pathogenesis of CAPA remains unclear. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disrupts pathways related to type I interferon and Toll-like receptors, key components in innate immunity, thereby elevating the incidence of CAPA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in T and B cell functional deficiencies or exhaustion within adaptive immunity, weakening the defense against invasive Aspergillus. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and alters the gut microbiota, factors that may aid in diagnosing CAPA. Immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 patients is also believed to heighten the risk of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, this review, examines the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with invasive aspergillosis, and explores the pathogenesis and susceptibility factors of CAPA. We propose that variations in an individual’s immune response significantly determine susceptibility to CAPA. The aim of this paper is to deepen clinical understanding of CAPA’s pathogenesis, thereby aiding in mitigating susceptibility risk and advancing novel treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on human activities. Moreover, direct viral damage and uncontrolled inflammation have been proposed as contributing factors to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is also well recognized for its capability to trigger and modulate the host’s innate immune system by attaching to bacterial substances. Nevertheless, the pandemic has further emphasized the critical role of an effective host immune response in controlling viral infection and highlighted the detrimental effect of immune dysregulation. This study aimed to assess plasma levels of LBP and inflammatory biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 patients with different malnutrition status and severity levels. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh from December 2020 to December 2021. A total of 166 SARS-CoV-2 patients were recruited including 80 critical and 86 non-critical patients. Medical history, anthropometrical parameters, disease outcome information, and relevant biochemical parameters were extracted from medical records. Plasma samples were collected to test for LBP and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, nutritional risk was assessed by the Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002) tool. Results: This cross-sectional study found no significant differences in LBP levels between critical and non-critical SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, LBP levels significantly correlated with IL-10, TNF-α and IL-6/IL-10 levels (Spearman’s rho = 0.430, 0.276 and −0.397 respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study confirmed the elevated inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and their association with disease severity and malnutrition. These findings may support the mechanism of gut inflammation in order to develop new interventions that lower inflammatory biomarkers, disease severity, and aid in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and management.">

        <tr id="Complement overactivation, has been verified in COVID-19 patients. Complement regulatory proteins, including CD55, control complement overactivation thus eliminating complement deposition and cell lysis. We investigated complement regulatory protein expression in COVID-19 for potential deregulated expression patterns driving disease pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed increased PBMCs CD55 expression in severely and critically ill patients. This increase was also detected upon integrated subclustering analysis of monocyte, T cell and B cell populations. FACS analysis confirmed the significant upregulation of CD55 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocyte populations of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients. This upregulation was associated with decreased expression of type-I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, indicating a suppressor effect of CD55. Silencing of CD55 in T cells from COVID-19 severely ill patients in vitro and sensitization with SARS-CoV-2 peptides resulted in significantly augmented expression of ISGs and a reversal of their expression to levels similar to control or higher. The present study uncovers, to the best of our knowledge, a novel regulatory effect of CD55 on type-I IFN responses of severely ill COVID-19 patients, thus indicating its contribution to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and identifies a novel mechanistic pathway in the COVID-19 immune response.">

Investigating the altered pathogenicity of coexisting microorganisms and their influence on disease progression provides valuable insights for the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against infectious processes. This article provides a comprehensive review of current literature on viral-bacterial interactions in the context of respiratory infections, their pathogenic mechanisms, and significance during the COVID-19 pandemic. It synthesizes recent findings on how SARS-CoV-2 influences mucosal immunity, facilitates secondary bacterial infections through immune modulation, and impacts disease severity and clinical outcomes in co-infected individuals. Special attention is given to the molecular and cellular pathways mediating virus-bacteria interactions, including host receptor modulation, cytokine and interferon response alterations, and disruptions to the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiota. The epidemiological trends observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including shifts in the prevalence of common respiratory pathogens and the emergence of new co-infection patterns, are also considered. Understanding the dynamic interplay between viral and bacterial pathogens is crucial for optimizing patient management, improving outcomes, and guiding effective public health interventions.">

        <tr id="Introduction 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery. Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include, among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction. Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS disease on monocyte subpopulations. Methods Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes, whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies. However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. Discussion This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with PACS.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infections in children lead to symptoms from mild respiratory illness to severe postacute sequelae of COVID-19, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Children (MIS-C). We conducted a metabolic profiling of 147 children's serum samples, including acute COVID-19 patients, MIS-C patients, and healthy controls. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we measured 1101 metabolites. The results revealed distinct metabolic profiles in acute COVID-19 and MIS-C patients, with significant alterations in lipid classes. Both conditions exhibited an elevated Apo-B100/Apo-A1 ratio and increased serum inflammatory markers. MIS-C patients showed unique disruptions, including increased triglycerides and altered lipoprotein composition. Despite milder clinical respiratory symptoms, children's metabolic disturbances mirrored those seen in severe adult COVID-19 patients, indicating a shared inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. This suggests potential long-term health impacts, underscoring the need for continued research into the metabolic consequences of COVID-19 in children.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neuroplasticity in the adult colon enables the enteric nervous system (ENS) to adaptively remodel in response to acute inflammation, preserving motility. However, chronic inflammation may drive maladaptive neuroplasticity, resulting in gastrointestinal dysmotility, a hallmark of functional gastrointestinal disorders, including Gulf War illness (GWI). GWI affects ∼30% of Gulf War veterans and has been linked to oral toxic exposures during combat, such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB). To explore mechanisms of persistent dysmotility, we developed a PB exposure model relevant to GWI. In the colon, we observed structural and functional ENS changes, including an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons and altered motility patterns. These were accompanied by a sustained influx of pro-inflammatory macrophages and elevated cytokine levels, indicating persistent low-grade enteric neuroinflammation. Inflammatory macrophages were found near enteric neural stem cells (ENSCs), impairing their regenerative potential. Transcriptomic analyses corroborated the presence of chronic neuroinflammation and dysregulated repair pathways. Together, our findings suggest that persistent enteric neuroinflammation and impaired neurogenesis contribute to long-term colonic dysmotility in GWI. This model offers new insights into chronic ENS dysfunction and may guide therapeutic strategies for GWI and related disorders.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Des-ignated as an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020, the virus quickly escalated to a global emergency, officially declared a pandemic in March 2020. With over 6 million recorded deaths and more than 200 identified symptoms in diverse individuals, the impact of COVID-19 is substantial. COVID-19 poses a greater risk to individuals with advanced HIV, while those with well-managed HIV are not at increased risk. Although COVID-19 vaccines are generally effective for people with HIV, some may experience reduced vaccine effectiveness and breakthrough infections due to suboptimal immune responses. Long COVID, affecting at least 65 million individuals, adds a layer of complexity. The virus's rapid mutation has led to diverse symptomatology, prompting adjustments in treatment guidelines. This review compre-hensively examines repurposed antiviral drug candidates against COVID-19, explores immune responses across different age groups, delves into the mechanisms of COVID-19 vaccines, and discusses potential immunosuppressants. Additionally, the focus extends to Intravenous Immu-noglobulin (IVIG), steroids, and anti-cytokine therapy as promising avenues to address cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a critical condition in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Background Monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in phagocytic reactions, which potentially play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Imbalance of these cells in peripheral blood has proven to affect not only innate but also adaptive immunity. It is possible that a search for strategies to restore monocyte activity could be a major step in achieving immune control over COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes and neutrophils, and COVID-19 severity, to assess the effects of a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent on phagocytosis parameters in in-hospital COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study included 105 adult patients with moderate COVID-19, who had been hospitalized in 2020–2021 and treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. All patients were divided into two groups: in Group 1 patients received standard treatment and Immunovac VP4 therapeutic vaccine, a bacteria-based immunostimulating agent as add-on therapy from Day 1 of hospitalization; in Group 2 patients did not receive any add-on treatment. The study parameters included C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), SpO2, lung involvement on chest computer tomography (CT) scan, and phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes based on the absorption activity (AA) of monocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes against S. аureus). The parameters were assessed at 1, 14 and 30 days. Results Based on a cluster analysis of the clinical findings and the results of diagnostic tests obtained on admission, the patients were divided into 2 clusters: cluster 1 including patients with a more severe disease (n = 34) and cluster 2 including patients with a less severe disease (n = 71). Cluster 1 patients had higher levels of CRP (20.1 vs. 2.2 mg/mL, p < 0.001), AST (32.9 vs. 26.2 U/L, p = 0.003), lower SpO2 (94% vs. 96%, p < 0,001) and more extensive lung involvement on chest CT scan (35% vs. 12%, p < 0,001). There was a statistically significant direct correlation between blood monocyte AA and SpO2 (p = 0.04), an inverse correlation between monocyte AA and CRP (p = 0.003) and the extent of lung involvement on CT scan (p = 0.05). In less severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 2), no statistically significant correlation was observed. In more severe COVID-19 patients (cluster 1), there was a rise in monocyte AA on day 30 of hospitalization both in the control group (from 86.6 to 92.2, p = 0.03) and the main group, who received Immunovac VP4 add-on therapy (from 87.3 to 98.3, p = 0.05). However, the patients who received the immunostimulating agent, had higher monocyte PI than the controls, without the immunostimulant (p = 0.05). Patients from cluster 1 who were given Immunovac VP4 had higher SpO2 levels (98% vs. 97%, p = 0.01) than those who had received only the standard treatment. Discussion Blood monocyte AA correlates with COVID-19 severity: patients with less severe disease have higher AA and those with more severe illness have lower AA. The standard treatment, combined with Immunovac VP4 enhances phagocytic activity of peripheral-blood monocytes, which is associated with a more marked increase in SpO2, especially in more severe patients.">

This study investigates the cytokine gene expression profile in cortical tissue samples from elderly individuals with and without AD to identify potential biomarkers and enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Utilizing high-depth RNA sequencing data, we identified a set of cytokines whose expression significantly associated with different aspects of the AD phenotype, including measures of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-β deposition, and a person-specific rate of cognitive decline. Single-nucleus transcriptomics data facilitated the identification of specific cell types, such as microglia and oligodendrocytes, that significantly contribute to the inflammatory response in AD. Additionally, we observed a strong correlation between the expression of certain cytokines and genetic risk for the disease. Our findings indicate that cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation plays a vital role in AD progression and that modulating the immune response may offer a promising strategy for developing new therapies.">

Although COVID-19 is no longer a global emergency, understanding vaccine responses in this vulnerable population, especially those undergoing active cancer treatments, remains critical for broader infectious disease prevention strategies. We have characterized the humoral and cellular immune response of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicited by CLL individuals under standard-of-care treatment and watch and wait (W&W) strategy compared with healthy subjects who received a three-dose regimen six months ago. Seroconversion rates varied between 81.8% and 71.4% in individuals under W&W and dropped to 28.6%-22.2% in those under treatment, with antibody titres and neutralizing activity following the same pattern, highlighting the impact of active therapies on vaccine immunogenicity. Analysis of B-cell dynamics revealed that individuals under W&W maintained the highest levels of total B cells (CD19+) throughout the study (up to 3.5-fold higher than healthy donors, p<0.0001). Basal naïve B cells were markedly reduced across CLL groups (up to 4.3-fold lower in treated vs. W&W, p<0.0001), while memory subsets expanded over time, particularly in the W&W cohort after booster vaccination. Additionally, we found that the actively treated CLL group exhibited higher levels of cytotoxic cells (including CD8+ T cells and NK cells) when compared to the W&W or the healthy population groups. However, none of these cell populations demonstrated an increased activation capacity. Moreover, the direct cytotoxic capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL persons was also more efficient in the W&W group. Through our comprehensive characterization of both humoral and cellular immune responses in CLL individuals, this study provides insight into the complex immunological landscape following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our detailed analysis supports the current vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2 for CLL patients, confirming its effectiveness and underscoring the importance of close monitoring and representing a significant advancement in our understanding of immune responses in hematological malignancies.">

        <tr id="The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has plunged the world into a major crisis of overwhelming morbidity and mortality and emerged various mutant strains. Patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 develop post-acute COVID syndrome, commonly known as long COVID (LC), lasting up to 12 weeks or even longer. The mechanism has yet to be clarified. COVID-19 pseudovirus is a suitable model to understand the infection of the COVID-19 virus to cells, which is suitable to see the acute change in cells owing to its one-time infection and inactivation. The ACE2-293T cell infected by COVID-19 pseudovirus was used in this study. After the infection and removal of the pseudovirus, high amounts of ferrous ions were accumulated in mitochondria and then released into the cytosol. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was formed and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. To evaluate the effect of nutritional strategy on ferrous ion accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, lactoferrin, Q10 and Echinacea purpurea extract (EPE) were used in this study. Results showed that lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE could improve mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in the mitochondria. HPLC analysis showed that EPE contained rich caffeic acid, and it also showed perfect improvement in mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, cells infected with pseudovirus could increase the accumulation of ferrous ions and ROS in mitochondria and be released into the cytosol after removing pseudovirus, thereby causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Lactoferrin, Q10 and EPE were an effective nutritional strategy to suppress ferrous ion accumulation, ROS formation and advanced mitochondrial dysfunction.">

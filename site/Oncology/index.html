        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Factors regulating the severity of pneumonitis during viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found higher expression of protein S (PROS1) in lung epithelium of mild compared to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We hypothesized that PROS1 may protect the upper airways by regulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods To test this, in vitro air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of primary healthy human lung epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. This model, validated through immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy, and single-cell RNA-sequencing, replicated pathogenic changes seen in the lungs of COVID-19. Regulation and secretion of PROS1, along with multiple soluble mediators, were quantified in control and infected cultures using ELISAs. Results We found that PROS1 is present in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium and is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection through an IFN-mediated process. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PROS1 downregulated the SARS-CoV-2-induced proinflammatory phenotypes of basal cells, transforming pathogenic CXCL10/11high into a regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 increased the secretion of M-CSF from epithelial cells, which induced the expression of PROS1 receptor MERTK on monocytes interacting with the lung epithelium. PROS1, in turn, shifted SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic monocyte phenotypes toward a phenotype with increased MHC class II. Conclusion These findings highlight the crucial role of PROS1 in protecting against severe lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, by reducing epithelial- and monocyte-derived inflammation, promoting pro-repair epithelial phenotypes, and enhancing antigen presentation in myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) syndrome or “Long COVID” represents a widespread health challenge that necessitates the development of novel diagnostic approaches and targeted therapies that can be readily deployed. Immune dysregulation has been reported as one of the hallmarks of PASC, but the extent of PASC immune dysregulation in patients over time remains unclear. We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, peripheral immune cell profiles, autoantibody profiles and circulating cytokines for up to 6 months in participants with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who either convalesced or developed PASC. Compared to convalescent, PASC participants with a broad range of PASC phenotypes exhibited persistently elevated IgG titers for SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Nucleocapsid proteins over the 6 months of study duration. In contrast, the IgG responses to Spike protein were significantly lower in the PASC cohort with predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 class-switched bias. Using CyTOF analysis, we show elevated numbers of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) and mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT), which also correlated with high anti-Envelope IgG titers. Persistent immune activation was accompanied by augmented serum cytokine profiles with LIF, IL-11, Eotaxin-3, and HMGB-1 in PASC participants, who also demonstrated significantly higher rates of autoantibodies. These findings highlight the persistence of immune dysregulation in PASC, underscoring the need to explore targeted therapies addressing viral persistence, dysregulated antibody production, and autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to study how human immune responses develop to a novel viral antigen delivered through different vaccine platforms. However, to date, no study has directly compared immune responses to all three FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines at single-cell multi-omic resolution. We longitudinally profiled SARS-CoV-2–naïve adults (n=31) vaccinated with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S, integrating plasma cytokines, antibody titers, and single-cell multi-omic data (DOGMA-seq). We discovered a distinct, transient interferon program (ISG-dim) that emerged specifically 1–2 days after the first mRNA dose in ~10% of myeloid cells. This state was characterized by ISGF3 complex activation and its target genes (e.g., MX1, MX2, DDX58), with transcriptional and epigenetic profiles distinct from the robust interferon program observed after mRNA boosting or a single Ad26.COV2.S dose (ISG-high). In vitro stimulation of human monocytes showed that IFN-α alone recapitulates ISG-dim, whereas both IFN-α and IFN-γ are required for ISG-high. These findings define dose-dependent interferon programming in human myeloid cells, highlight mechanistic differences between priming and boosting, with implications for optimizing vaccine platform choice, dose scheduling, and formulation.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Understanding age-associated differences in acute and memory adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and how this contributes to more favorable outcomes in children is critically important.


METHODS
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell, B cell, and antibody responses in 329 peripheral blood samples collected from non-hospitalized children, adolescents, and adults at three timepoints, including acute and memory timepoints.


RESULTS
Most children produced robust CD4+ T cell responses during infection and developed memory CD4+ T cells; however, young children <4 years old often had undetectable CD4+ T cell responses compared to older children and adults. Young children also generated reduced frequencies of memory B cells; despite this, they mounted substantial and durable neutralizing antibody responses. CD4+ T cell responses in children were biased towards non-spike epitopes, especially in asymptomatic cases. Memory B cells in children were preferentially classical memory or, paradoxically, CXCR3+.


CONCLUSION
These findings support the concept that the kinetics and composition of T and B cell responses shift across age groups and may be associated with milder COVID-19 outcomes in children.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Long COVID syndrome is a major global health problem, affecting approximately 10–20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with many remaining symptomatic beyond one year. Fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance and hyperlactataemia on minimal exertion have led to the suggestion of a bioenergetic defect. We hypothesised that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological feature in Long COVID cases and would correlate with clinical outcome. Methods This prospective, case-controlled, observational study recruited 27 participants with an established diagnosis of Long COVID syndrome from a single tertiary clinic together with 16 age-matched controls aged 25–65 years. Seahorse-based mitochondrial flux analysis and bioenergetics profile of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed and correlated with clinical phenotype. Findings Long COVID cases had an increased baseline and ATP-induced oxygen consumption rate with a significant attenuation in tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate fluorescence response to oligomycin. Correlations were observed between mitochondrial function and autonomic health, quality of life and time from index infection. Sex-specific differences were also observed. Interpretation PBMCs from Long COVID subjects exhibit an exceptional and distinctive change in ATP synthase, as it contributes to the mitochondrial membrane potential rather than using it exclusively to generate ATP. The findings suggest that the enzyme runs both forward and reverse reactions, synthesising and hydrolysing ATP. The correlation of mitochondrial function with clinical phenotype in Long COVID may indicate a causal relationship and warrants further validation in larger scale studies.">

While humanized major histocompatibility complex (hMHC) murine models have been extensively utilized in oncological research, their application in virological studies-particularly for coronavirus pathogenesis-remains underexplored. Methods This study systematically characterized immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-challenged hMHC mice lung tissues through comparative transcriptomic profiling, combined with functional enrichment and PPI network analyses. Results Key findings demonstrate that hMHC mice exhibit enhanced immunological activation relative to wild-type controls, particularly in IFN-γ signaling pathways and neutrophil mobilization dynamics that closely parallel human post-vaccination responses. Comparative analysis with human whole blood RNA-seq datasets revealed that hMHC mice exhibit both high reproducibility in transcriptomic profiles and significant similarity to human immune responses across innate and adaptive immunity. Conclusions These results confirm that the hMHC murine model can serve as an effective platform for vaccine research, providing a theoretical foundation for the application of humanized MHC mice and offering new insights into viral infection mechanisms and the development of novel vaccines.">

        <tr id="Sweet syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory skin disorder characterized by erythematous plaques with a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. First-line therapy remains oral corticosteroids, which suppresses inflammation non-specifically. Although neutrophils are typically short-lived, how they persist in Sweet syndrome skin and contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized population of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like neutrophils expressing MHC class II genes that are uniquely present in Sweet syndrome skin but absent from healthy tissue and circulation. Keratinocytes extended neutrophil lifespan 10-fold in co-culture experiments and drove the emergence of an APC-like phenotype in approximately 30% of neutrophils, mirroring observations in patient lesions. Mechanistically, keratinocyte-derived serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) signals through the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on neutrophils to promote their survival. These long-lived neutrophils actively orchestrate local immune responses by recruiting T cells and inducing cytokine production. Strikingly, dual blockade of SAA1-FPR2 signaling restores neutrophil turnover to baseline levels, with efficacy comparable to high-dose corticosteroids. These findings uncover a keratinocyte-neutrophil-T cell axis that sustains chronic inflammation in Sweet syndrome and highlight the SAA1/FPR2 pathway as a promising target for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="APOBEC3B (A3B) has been implicated in host–virus interactions, but its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that A3B is overexpressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells from severe COVID-19 patients compared to those with mild disease. A3B knockdown in Caco-2 cells significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, likely through attenuation of the PKR-mediated integrated stress response, a pathway proposed to promote SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data suggest that BALF cells from severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a repressed state for cellular translation, potentially mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation. However, in A549-ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 does not activate PKR, but A3B knockdown still reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action in different cellular contexts. To further investigate A3B’s role in severe COVID-19, we employed Geneformer, a transformer-based machine learning model, which predicted that A3B knockout would perturb AMPD2 (adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2), a key enzyme in purine metabolism and immune regulation. We validated this prediction using bulk RNA-seq and clinical scRNA-seq data, confirming that AMPD2 expression is downregulated in severe COVID-19 but restored upon A3B knockdown. Together, these findings suggest that A3B plays a proviral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating translational control and immune regulatory networks, warranting further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanistic details.">

We tested whether prior exposure of macaques to these immunogens protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lungs and found more efficient replication control after the pro-inflammatory immunity elicited by BCG. The decreased virus level in lungs was linked to early infiltrates of classical monocytes producing IL-8 with systemic neutrophils, Th2 cells, and Ki67+CD95+CD4+ T cells producing CCR7. At the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, BCG-treated animals had higher frequencies of lung infiltrating neutrophils and higher CD14+ cells expressing efferocytosis marker MERTK, responses correlating with decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung. At the same time point, plasma IL-18, TNF-α, TNFSF-10, and VEGFA levels were also higher in the BCG group and correlated with decreased virus replication. Finally, after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, decreased virus replication correlated with neutrophils producing IL-10 and CCR7 preferentially recruited to the lungs of BCG-vaccinated animals. These data point to the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of functional monocytes and neutrophils in controlling SARS-CoV-2 levels and suggest a central role of monocyte efferocytosis in curbing replication.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often-fatal neurodegenerative disease, is caused by the neuroinvasive polyomavirus JCPyV. Peripheral organs, including the kidney, are the site of lifelong persistent infections that are asymptomatic. In a subset of immunosuppressed or immunomodulated patients, the virus invades the central nervous system infecting oligodendrocytes, which leads to the multifocal white matter disease known as PML. The mechanisms that lead to neuroinvasion by JCPyV have not been well described. The brain is protected from viruses and other pathogens by physiological barriers, including the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the blood-brain barrier. To better understand the mechanism by which the virus breaches these barriers, we focused our attention on studying virus interactions with pericytes, which are an essential component of the blood-brain barrier. We found that the virus binds to pericytes in a receptor-dependent manner and that pericytes are susceptible to JCPyV infection. Previous work from our group demonstrated that JCPyV was capable of penetrating an intact endothelial cell barrier. Once across the endothelium, JCPyV would come in direct contact with pericytes, and we hypothesize pericyte infection would amplify and facilitate robust penetration into the brain parenchyma. This is the first demonstration that pericytes, a principal component of the blood-brain barrier, are susceptible to the neuroinvasive human polyomavirus JCPyV. IMPORTANCE JCPyV infects at least half the adult population worldwide. An asymptomatic, persistent infection is typically established in the kidney and possibly other peripheral organs. In immunosuppressed individuals, the virus can reactivate and cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a deadly disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The pathogenic route the virus takes from the periphery to the CNS is unknown. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that JCPyV can infect human cerebrovascular pericytes, a cell type that contributes to the blood-brain barrier. This observation suggests that the virus could use the pericytes as a means to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to reach its pathogenic targets in the brain parenchyma.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Adults and children often respond differently to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with adults facing a higher risk of symptomatic and severe illness. We hypothesize that children's protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 may be due to more frequent respiratory viral infections, which prime their airway antiviral defenses.


METHODS
Using case-cohort and case-control analyses in the Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 cohort, we evaluated whether infection with common respiratory viruses protects against SARS-CoV-2 infections and investigated airway molecular mechanisms by which this protection is achieved. We tested 10,493 longitudinal nasal swabs from 1,156 participants for 21 respiratory pathogens. We performed RNA-sequencing on 147 swabs (N=144 participants) collected prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and 391 swabs (N=165 participants) during and before rhinovirus infection.


RESULTS
Participants with rhinovirus infection in the previous 30 days were at 48% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR:0.52, p=0.034). Among participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recent rhinovirus infection was associated with 9.6-fold lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p=0.0031). Higher pre-infection expression of 57 genes was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load, including 24 antiviral defense genes; 22 of these were induced by rhinovirus infections. Relative to adults, children expressed higher levels of the antiviral gene signature (p=0.014) and were at 2.2-fold increased risk for rhinovirus infections.


CONCLUSIONS
Rhinovirus infections, which trigger increased expression of antiviral airway genes, are linked to a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Frequent rhinovirus infections may enhance this protective gene profile, partially explaining why children experience milder SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to adults.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is primarily known as a respiratory disease. The continued study of the disease has shown that long-term COVID-19 symptoms include persisting effects of the virus on the brain when the infection is over, possibly even leading to neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanisms of nervous system damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear. In this study, we focused on two possibly shared pathways of SARS-CoV-2-induced neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration: protein aggregation, which is associated with impaired protein clearance, and inflammatory responses, which involve a hyper-active immune status. We observed distinct expression and distribution patterns of ten SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the two cell lines, meanwhile forming aggregation puncta and inducing pro-inflammatory responses. We found that the ER stress was induced and that the autophagy-lysosome pathway was inhibited upon viral protein expression. Boosting autophagy function attenuated protein aggregation, suggesting that modulation of autophagy might be a valid strategy for inhibiting cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV- 2 proteins. Our study provides potential explanations of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage, based on shared cellular mechanisms and furthermore, suggests that modulation of proteostasis may serve as therapeutic strategies for preventing long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 cytotoxic effects.">

        <tr id="Introduction Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is a long-lasting, multisystemic syndrome affecting approximately 30% of individuals after acute COVID-19, with neurological symptoms among the most prevalent and debilitating. Despite its substantial global health impact, the biological mechanisms underlying PCC remain poorly understood, underscoring the need for validated animal models. Methods To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study using the golden Syrian hamster model, integrating virological, immunological, histopathological, and behavioral analyses from the acute phase to 60 days post-inoculation. Results Our results showed persistent viral RNA, prolonged immune dysregulation, and behavioral changes that mirrored key features of human PCC. Discussion Although fully reproducing PCC in animal models is inherently challenging due to its complex and heterogeneous presentation in humans, the use of complementary models with distinct phenotypes is essential for elucidating its pathophysiology. These results aim to contribute valuable insights into the biological basis of PCC and support the development of targeted preventative and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction GM-CSF is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes an inflammatory phenotype in myeloid cells. The extent and pattern of GM-CSF expression in immune cells have not been fully elucidated. Our goal was to advance this topic using novel GM-CSF reporter/fate reporter transgenic mice. Methods We tracked ongoing and past GM-CSF expression in various immune cells from multiple organs, in steady-state and autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS). Results The GM-CSF expression patterns varied by cell type and organ, with CD4+, CD8+, and CD11b+ cells being the main producers. GM-CSF expression was transient and seemingly permanently lost in most cells over time. In a mouse model of CNS autoimmunity, effector memory CD4+ T cells were the dominant GM-CSF source in the CNS. A large proportion of CD4+ T cells that expressed GM-CSF also expressed CXCR6, but this chemokine receptor did not play a main role in the CNS autoimmunity. Transcriptomic analysis showed notably distinct gene expression profiles between effector memory CD4+ T cells that did and did not express GM-CSF. Discussion These findings identified distinct GM-CSF cellular sources across organs, highlighting the transient nature of GM-CSF expression and the correlation between its expression and the overall phenotype of effector memory CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Children with COVID-19 typically experience milder symptoms and lower hospitalization rates, though severe cases do occur. Understanding age-related immune responses is crucial for future preparedness. We characterized immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in 145 samples from 119 pediatric patients (<18 years) with confirmed infection, assessed at four distinct time points: <14 days, 14 days–3 months, 3–6 months, and 6–12 months post-infection. At infection, patients presented increased activated T-cells, higher levels of exhaustion (i.e., PD-1+), lower numbers of unswitched memory B-cells, and increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Both humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses increased over time (all patients showed measurable responses in the last assessment). Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients (58.6%) showed increased specific cellular responses from infection onwards, along with enriched memory B-cell subsets (but not ASCs), and distinct T-cell activation profiles. Children with severe disease were younger, predominantly boys, displayed altered T/B-cell ratios, and reduced PHA responses when infected. Compared to adolescents, younger children showed lower antibody titers and weaker cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, possibly underlining the higher prevalence of severe manifestations in younger children. Our study illustrates important age-, gender-, and disease severity-dependent variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which can be helpful in improving patient management and immunization strategies adjusted to age groups.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases. Our findings may provide new clues for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and help identify optimal biomarkers for new therapeutic strategies.

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are known risk factors for both PD and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting a link between PD and the gastrointestinal tract. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing and spectral flow cytometry, we demonstrated that the Lrrk2 Gly2019Ser (G2019S) mutation is associated with an increased neutrophil presence in the colonic lamina propria during Citrobacter rodentium infection. This concurred with a Th17 skewing, upregulated Il17a, and greater colonic pathology during infection. In vitro experiments showed enhanced kinase-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in Lrrk2 G2019S mice compared to wild-type counterparts. Our results add to the understanding of LRRK2-driven immune cell dysregulation and its contribution to PD, offering insights into potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention in PD.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of severe lower respiratory tract infections, especially in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Complications arising from viral infections in these age groups can present therapeutic challenges, as most of these individuals have impaired adaptive immunity. Using the T‐ and B cell‐deficient Rag2−/− mice, the mechanisms that mediate protection in immunocompromised hosts during RSV infection can be investigated. RSV‐infected Rag2−/− mice showed no symptoms of disease or chronic inflammation in the lungs and airways despite the presence of infectious virus in their lungs several months after infection. Interestingly, Natural Killer (NK) cells, the main innate cells with anti‐viral cytotoxic effector functions, were recruited 2 days earlier in the lungs of Rag2−/− mice compared with wildtype mice, resulting in early production of IFN‐γ. However, depletion of NK cells did not affect disease severity or viral load. Together, these results suggest that the NK cells are largely dispensable for virus control during primary RSV infection in Rag2−/− mice.">

        <tr id="Hantaviruses are zoonotically transmitted from rodents to humans through the respiratory route, with no currently approved antivirals or widely available vaccines. The recent discovery of interhuman-transmitted Andes virus (ANDV) necessitates the systematic identification of cell tropism, infective potential, and potent therapeutic agents. We utilized human primary lung endothelial cells, various pluripotent stem cell-derived heart and brain cell types, and established human lung organoid models to evaluate the tropisms of Old World Hantaan (HTNV) and New World ANDV and Sin Nombre (SNV) viruses. ANDV exhibited broad tropism for all cell types assessed. SNV readily infected pulmonary endothelial cells, while HTNV robustly amplified in endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and astrocytes. We also provide the first evidence of hantaviral infection in human 3D distal lung organoids, which effectively modeled these differential tropisms. ANDV infection transcriptionally promoted cell injury and inflammatory responses, and downregulated lipid metabolic pathways in lung epithelial cells. Evaluation of selected drug candidates and pharmacotranscriptomics revealed that the host-directed small molecule compound urolithin B inhibited ANDV infection and restored cellular metabolism with minimal changes in host transcription. Given the scarcity of academic BSL-4 facilities that enable in vivo hantaviral studies, this investigation presents advanced human cell-based model systems that closely recapitulate host cell tropism and responses to infection, thereby providing critical platforms to evaluate potential antiviral drug candidates.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The markedly reduced pathogenicity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant in comparison to earlier strains has raised critical questions regarding its underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the host immune responses driving these differences, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung and blood samples from human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice infected with either the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain or the Omicron BA.1 variant at 5 days post-inoculation. Both strains induced a reduction in lung cell numbers, with capillary endothelial cells showing the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Shared transcriptional responses included upregulation of chemokine (e.g. Gnaq, Lyn, Ccl5) and IL-17 signaling pathways. Notably, Omicron BA.1 infection resulted in downregulation of Txnip, a key gene involved in oxidative stress responses. Genes associated with neutrophil granules and pro-inflammatory functions (Mmp8, S100a8, S100a9) were also downregulated, whereas wound healing pathways were upregulated in immature neutrophils. Additionally, Omicron BA.1 altered gene expression associated with neutrophil migration from blood to lung, and decreased the activation of cell chemotaxis, cytokine-mediated signaling, IL-17 and NF-κB pathways in pro-inflammatory monocytes and pulmonary interstitial macrophages. These findings highlight distinct immunological signatures contributing to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron BA.1, particularly through the modulation of neutrophil and monocyte-macrophage responses.">

Developing innovative therapeutic strategies that simultaneously suppress detrimental inflammatory cascades and facilitate neurorestorative processes is critical for improving long‐term rehabilitation outcomes. Methods We employed a microglia depletion‐repopulation paradigm by administering PLX5622 for 7 days post‐ischemia; followed by a 7‐day withdrawal period to allow microglia repopulation. Single‐cell transcriptomics, behavioral testing, cytokine arrays, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to assess the effects of microglia repopulation and delineate the transition of reshaped immune microenvironment. Results PLX5622 administration reshaped the poststroke immune microenvironment, promoting neurofunctional recovery. Repopulated microglia adopted a homeostatic phenotype, increasing homeostatic states by ~14.36% and reducing pro‐inflammatory states by ~20.17%. This reshaped environment suppressed T cell exhaustion, limited neutrophil terminal differentiation, and promoted a phagocytic macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, we identified that these transitions in infiltrating immune cells may be driven by reduced chemokine production, enhanced blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and transcriptional reprogramming. Conclusion Transient microglial depletion and repopulation via PLX5622 during the acute phase post stroke facilitate the recovery of neurological function. This immunomodulatory strategy offers a promising and clinically translationally relevant approach to enhance functional recovery following ischemic brain injury.">

However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-ɑ was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-ɑ-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-ɑ and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Background Although COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract, liver injury has been increasingly reported in infected individuals. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces hepatocyte damage remain poorly understood. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and regulated cell death in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocytes using the Huh7.5 cell model. Methods Huh7.5 hepatocytes were infected with either the ancestral Wuhan (Wh) or Omicron (BA.5) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Viral replication was quantified via RT-qPCR, nucleocapsid protein detection, and infectious particle titration. Mitochondrial function was assessed through mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mROS production, and mitophagy analysis. Lipid metabolism and regulated cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) were evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of specific cell death pathways was probed using chemical inhibitors. Results Both SARS-CoV-2 variants efficiently infected Huh7.5 cells, with distinct replication kinetics. Infection induced mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mROS levels, and lipid droplet accumulation. Ferroptosis was identified as a predominant mode of cell death, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and the protective effect of ferrostatin-1. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a ferroptosis marker and alternative viral entry receptor, was significantly upregulated post-infection in a variant-dependent manner. Additionally, mROS scavenging with MitoTEMPO impaired viral replication, underscoring the role of oxidative stress in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, promoting ferroptosis as a major contributor to virus-induced cytopathology. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may play a central role in COVID-19-related liver injury and identify mitochondrial ROS and iron metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="To better understand the molecular mechanism that drives neuroinflammation, we analyzed the protein profiles of 27 brains from HIV with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), including various stages of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and compared them to 9 HAND-negative controls. We found that most of the proteins that were increased—about 66.7%—were involved in immune response pathways. Of these, 23.3% were specifically related to type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which remains active in the brain through both HIV-related and unrelated mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on brain tissues collected during rapid autopsies from participants in the Last Gift cohort, we found that IFN-I signaling was especially strong in astrocytes, microglia (MG), and endothelial cells. In a mini-brain organoid model of acute HIV infection, IFN-I signaling was also highly active in astrocytes but less so in MG. Interestingly, IFN-I activation can happen without HIV being present—expression of human endogenous retrovirus-W1 (HERV-W1) Env can directly trigger this response in astrocytes, and it continues in glial cells even with effective ART. Together, our findings point to persistent IFN-I activation in glial and endothelial cells in the brain, which may contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive disorders in PWH on ART.">

Macrophages infected with EV-A71 were collected for transcriptomic analysis, and were indirectly co-cultured with nerve cells to observe their inhibitory effects on nerve cells. Results Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that EV-A71 infected severe HFMD patient had higher monocyte and macrophage ratio (18.50% vs. 8.85%), especially classical (64.59% vs. 57.24%) and non-classical (32.23% vs. 23.90%) monocytes, and a lower pDC (1.19% vs. 12.01%) and monoDC (1.98% vs. 6.80%) in EV-A71 infected severe HFMD patient. Dynamic analysis of PBMCs infected with EV-A71 isolates (mild, moderate and severe) and cell trajectory analysis indicated during infection, monocyte/macrophages were initially activated, followed by three groups of T cells and NK and B cells, M1 macrophage. High concentration of EV-A71 infected macrophage supernatant inhibited SH-SY5Y cell proliferation. ENSG00000285779, TICAM2, RPL13AP26 and HNF4G are significantly different in EV-A71 or inactivated EV-A71 infected macrophages than in control. ENSG00000264324, ENSG00000260643, ISLR2, CCR7, TENM4, INO80B-WBP1, BLOC1S5-TXNDC5 are potential genes about direct virus damage or viral RNA recognition in macrophages. GO annotation and KEGG analysis indicate that EV-A71 infection cause the changes of neural receptor-ligand binding pathway, activation of specific immunity, calcium signaling pathway, and cell aggregation. Conclusions Macrophages are activated early during EV-A71 infection, thus initiating specific immunity, which is closely related to the severe HFMD. The nerve damage pathway and calcium signaling pathway caused by EV-A71 virus infection of macrophages deserve to more attention.">

        <tr id="African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an important transboundary animal pathogen with significant impacts on the global swine industry. Overwhelming proinflammatory responses are a major virulence mechanism for ASFV, but the dynamics of these changes during clinical disease are not completely understood. We constructed a detailed portrait of the innate immune responses during acute African swine fever (ASF) at the cellular, transcriptomic, and cytokine levels. Samples serially obtained from infected piglets show progression of acute ASF is characterized by rapid increases in plasma type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and IL-10, which coincide with the manifestation of clinical disease and viral DNAemia. Lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells progressively declined, with fluctuations in B cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell populations. Blood monocytes and macrophages were highly variable throughout infection, with an abrupt spike in CD203+ mature macrophages immediately prior to death. Transcriptomic analysis of blood showed downregulation of cellular translation as early as 1 day post challenge (DPC), and significant upregulation of antiviral immune processes at 5 DPC and 7 DPC which overlapped with the onset of clinical disease. Together, these results present a highly detailed delineation of fatal ASF as involving an initial infection and damage of susceptible myeloid cells prior to symptomatic disease characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, lymphoid depletion, and clinical deterioration.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV-infected and bystander-activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV-infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV-infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, such as neurocognitive disorders. Premorbid neurocognitive conditions compounded by COVID-19 can escalate into COVID-associated neurological complications, leading to severe illness or even death. As COVID-19 continues to persist and vaccines lose efficacy against emerging variants, individuals with neurocognitive disorders often experience prolonged symptoms that are further exacerbated by repeated breakthrough infections of highly diversified viral variants due to emergence of new viral mutations. Despite the significance of neurocognitive disorders as risk factors for COVID-19-related mortality and long COVID, the underlying causes remain largely unknown. In this study, we report a link between ORF3a expression and COVID-associated neuroinflammation and neurocytotoxicity in postmortem brain tissues from COVID-19 patients. These findings were further verified through neural cell-based in vitro and in vivo animal studies introducing ORF3a either alone or in the context of viral infection. As a membrane-associated protein, ORF3a induces upregulation of Sur1-regulated ion channels, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ influx, apoptosis, and necrosis through both NF-kB-dependent and independent proinflammatory responses in astrocytes. These findings reveal a novel clinical and mechanistic link between ORF3a and Sur1-regulated ion channels, which are highly responsive to neuroinflammatory conditions causing neurodegeneration. Additionally, we have identified a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, glibenclamide, and a natural antiviral compound glycyrrhizin that effectively mitigates the neuropathological effects of ORF3a, underscoring the therapeutic potential and clinical significance of these findings. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects individuals with pre-existing neurocognitive conditions primarily due to COVID-19-associated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity (CNN), which can progress to COVID-associated neurological disorders (CANDs), leading to severe illness and mortality. Despite CNN’s significant contribution to CANDs and related morbidity and mortality, its underlying causes remain poorly understood. Our study identifies ORF3a as a key driver of CNN, establishing a direct clinical and functional link between ORF3a and CNN linking to CANDs. Mechanistically, ORF3a disrupts ion homeostasis in astrocytes by promoting Ca²+ influx through Sur1-regulated ion channels, contributing to CNN. Notably, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug glibenclamide, a Sur1-specific inhibitor, and the natural compound glycyrrhizin effectively mitigate ORF3a-induced neuropathology, highlighting ORF3a as a promising therapeutic target. These findings present a potential strategy to eliminate CNN and prevent CANDs.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a global pandemic, significantly impacting social and economic aspects of society. While belonging to the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 exhibited unique characteristics that facilitated its widespread transmission and pathogenicity. This study aimed to investigate the molecular characterization and infection kinetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. We isolated 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples and conducted in vitro studies using Calu-3 cell lines and pseudovirus systems to explore viral entry. Whole-genome sequencing identified mutations linked to increased replication and enhanced immune evasion, particularly through the inhibition of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) revealed that certain variants, such as G446S, contributed to increased viral stability, suggesting potential for indirect transmission beyond direct person-to-person contact. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of “green” disinfectants, including tea tree oil and quercetin-based compounds, which demonstrated viral load reductions of over 95% within minutes, outperforming conventional alcohol- and UV-based disinfection methods. Notably, two influenza virus isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes are sanitized as well while showing different persistence surface profiles compared to SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the evolutionary strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 to ensure transmission, its ability to adapt under selective pressure, and the importance of ongoing surveillance of emerging variants. Moreover, the efficacy of environmentally sustainable disinfectants presents a promising strategy for reducing viral transmission in both clinical and community settings. IMPORTANCE In this study, we evaluated the molecular profile of 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. Through whole-genome sequencing, we identified mutations linked to enhanced replication and immune evasion, notably through the suppression of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) demonstrated that certain mutations, such as G446S, exhibited increased stability, suggesting a potential role for indirect transmission. This study underscores the need for continuous monitoring and the potential of eco-friendly disinfection approaches in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and possibly of other respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="In human neurocysticercosis (NCC), the cellular and molecular mechanisms of host-parasite interactions triggering brain inflammation and epileptic seizures in Sub-Saharan Africa are poorly understood. Emerging evidence indicates that the viability of the cyst of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium determines brain inflammation and, thus, symptom development and disease severity. We have previously shown that while viable cyst-released molecules promote immune regulation and often asymptomatic disease, the fluid from degenerating cysts causes inflammation in microglia and peripheral immune cells, potentially driving immune-mediated pathology. This study aims to elucidate the apoptotic signaling pathways underlying this process and their relevance for symptomatic disease in NCC patients.Human and porcine peripheral immune cells, as well as murine microglia, were exposed to T. solium cyst vesicular fluid (CVF). Apoptosis signaling pathways were analysed using flow cytometric FLICA (fluorochrome-labeled inhibitors of caspases) caspase 8 and 9 assays, while mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed via TMRE and MitoTracker Deep Red and Green fluorescent probes. Apoptosis-inducing CVF molecules were identified by differential mass spectrometry and functionally tested using specific inhibitors. Caspase activity and soluble mediators (FasL, ROS, TNFα) were measured in NCC asymptomatic and symptomatic patients’ sera, and inflammatory T cell infiltrates expressing caspases near viable and degenerating cysts in naturally infected pig brain slices were examined via immunohistology.We found that vesicular fluid derived from cysts primarily induced apoptosis and caspase 3 and 9 activity, and only minimal necrosis, in a dose-dependent manner across central and peripheral immune cells. This effect was prominent in CD16+ monocytes, microglia, and in CD3+ T cell-expressing caspase 3 near degenerating brain cysts. Apoptotic signaling was predominantly mediated by a dynamic remodeling of caspase 9 pathway, accompanied by a significant loss of mitochondrial potential and a sharp decrease in Bid and Bcl2 transcription, favoring the intrinsic over the FasL-dependent extrinsic pathway and mechanisms. This process is primarily mediated by small molecules (< 30 kDa), and remained unaffected by heat and proteinase treatment. Notably, symptomatic NCC patients exhibited elevated FasL levels correlating with increased caspase activity, underscoring the potential contribution of apoptosis to disease pathogenesis.This study identifies caspase 9-mediated apoptosis as a mechanism of helminth-induced brain inflammation and implicates FasL in symptomatic disease progression. These insights enhance our understanding of NCC immunopathogenesis and may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting apoptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="There is an increasing need to understand the long-term dynamics and quality of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory—both humoral and cellular—particularly with emerging variants. This study aimed to evaluate immune durability and variant-specific modulation through a longitudinal analysis of individuals with diverse SARS-CoV-2 exposure histories, over two years after infection and/or vaccination. The study involved assessing anti-spike IgG and IgA levels over time and analyzing their relationship with neutralizing activity against both ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Persistence of T cell responses was evaluated using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and activation-induced marker (AIM) assays. Anti-S IgG levels remained stable over time and increased after each immune stimulation, suggesting cumulative immune memory. Neutralizing capacity correlated strongly with IgG levels, showing long-term stability for pre-Omicron variants, but a moderate decline for Omicron. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses persisted across all groups, largely unaffected by Omicron mutations. However, cytokine profiles revealed subtle, variant-dependent changes. These findings underscore the durability of cellular immunity and the comparatively reduced robustness of Omicron-specific humoral responses. Such insights are crucial for understanding long-term protection against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and guiding public health strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Coronaviruses encode nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15), a conserved endoribonuclease (EndoU) known to suppress host antiviral responses. It is imperative to understand the role of Nsp15/EndoU during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in its primary target respiratory epithelial cells. Using a recombinant wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (rWT) and a mutant with catalytically inactive EndoU (rH234A), we show that the EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication in Vero cells but critically facilitates immune suppression and infection in physiologically relevant human lung cells, including human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Compared to rWT, rH234A infection elicited augmented type I and III interferon (IFN) responses and stronger RNase L activation, suggesting that Nsp15 suppresses these antiviral pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although rH234A infection increased PKR phosphorylation, downstream eIF2α phosphorylation and stress granule formation remained limited, implying incomplete PKR/eIF2α pathway activation. Furthermore, Nsp15 mutants lacking key residues required for hexamerization or double-stranded RNA binding also showed impaired replication and heightened IFN responses, highlighting the importance of these structural features for EndoU function. In vivo, rH234A was attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice, resulting in improved survival, reduced viral loads, and milder lung pathology. Together, these findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/EndoU as a key immune antagonist that facilitates lung infection, underscoring its potential as a target for antiviral development. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects upper and lower airway epithelial cells, and the latter infection can result in severe pneumonia. Understanding how the virus evades host immunity in these primary target cells is critical for developing effective therapies. Nsp15, a conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU), is known to suppress antiviral responses, but its precise role in respiratory epithelial cells has remained unclear. This study reveals that while EndoU activity is dispensable for viral replication, it is essential for dampening host defenses in human lung-derived epithelial cell lines, primary bronchial air-liquid interface cultures, and alveolar type 2 organoids. Loss of EndoU activity results in enhanced interferon signaling and RNase L activation, along with partial PKR pathway engagement. Structural integrity, including double-stranded RNA binding and hexamerization, is vital for Nsp15 function. In vivo, an EndoU-deficient virus is attenuated in K18-hACE2 mice. These findings position Nsp15 as a key immune antagonist and a promising target for antiviral intervention.">

        <tr id="A Cytokine storm is critical in severe dengue, significantly contributing to disrupted endothelial integrity, plasma leakage, and haemorrhage manifestations in affected patients. Various reports have demonstrated that mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, are target cells of DENV infection. They contribute to viral spread into tissues and promote robust inflammatory responses and immunopathology. However, it remains unclear whether the early events of DENV infection play a role in triggering cytokine storms in infected mononuclear phagocytes. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profile of in vitro DENV-2-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) based on the kinetics of viral replication through a standard growth curve. To verify the accuracy of our approach, we used RT-qPCR, ELISA, and transcriptomic data from in vitro DENV-2-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocytes obtained from acute dengue patients. RNA-Seq analysis revealed dynamic changes in the transcriptional profile of DENV-2-infected MDMs throughout the viral growth curve. Two waves of differentially expressed genes were observed: the first occurred during the eclipse period of viral replication (3 to 5.5 h.p.i) and was associated with the induction of NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory factors, while the second wave at 24 h.p.i coincided with peaks of DENV-2 replication and induction of both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, DENV-2 infection promoted the dynamic activation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-like receptors, inflammasomes, and inflammatory pathways, triggering innate pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses. A robust multi-type IFN-dependent antiviral response was also observed at the late stage of infection. A similar transcriptomic profile was found in DENV-2-infected MDDCs and monocyte subsets from acute dengue patients, further confirming the reliability of our in vitro model of DENV-infected MDMs. Together, results suggest that recognizing viral PAMPs during the eclipse period of DENV-2 infection promotes a robust NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in MDMs. In addition, at later stages of infection, recognizing structural DENV-PAMPs and/or viral replication intermediates induces both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a cytokine storm. These findings highlight the critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in detecting DENV infection and triggering a cytokine storm in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that these cell populations could be potential targets for future immunotherapies to modulate the inflammatory response to DENV infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunity response following vaccination and infection toward the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant remains limited in chronic liver disease (CLD) population. This study aims to investigate humoral and cell-mediate immunity to Omicron BA.4/5 among CLD patients with/without breakthrough infections (BI). This longitudinal study characterized immune responses to Omicron infection across three CLD patient groups: vaccinated without BI (group 1, n = 10), vaccinated with BI (group 2, n = 43), and unvaccinated infected (group 3, n = 7). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies/T-cell responses and lymphocyte phenotypes were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry. Logistic regression identified immunological correlates of BI event, viral clearance and liver disease progression. Dynamic immunity changes after infection analyzed using Spearman’s correlation. Patients in group 2 exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.4.5, anti-RBD IgG, and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to groups 1 and 3. Comparable T cell responses were observed between two vaccinated groups, stronger than unvaccinated individuals. Hybrid immune (vaccination plus infection) elicited stronger NAbs-WT, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, anti-RBD IgG, MBCs, and Omicron-specific IFN-γ+/IL-4+CD4+T cells compared to primary Omicron infection. Besides, severe liver disease was not only a risk factor for BI, but also impaired Omicron-specific IFN-γ+CD8+T, CD38+CD4+T, and CD45RA+CD8+T cells responses after infection. Importantly, IgG+/IgM+MBCs and NAbs showed positive associations with central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+CD4/8) or naive (CD45RA+CD62L+CD4) T cells. Low levels of CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+T cells and resting MBCs were identified as the independent risk factors for viral clearance and disease progression, respectively. BI predominantly stimulates humoral immunity without enhancing cellular responses. Weaker immune response induced by primary Omicron infection underscores the need for additional vaccinations in vaccine-naïve CLD patients. The positive correlations between humoral/cellular immunity and memory/activated T cells reveal their coordinated role in adaptive immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. These findings emphasize the importance of regular immune monitoring and timely interventions to optimize protection for CLD patients against emerging Omicron subvariants.">

        <tr id="Introduction An unbalanced immune response and excessive inflammation are the major hallmarks of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in multiorgan failure and death. The dysregulation of the complement system has been shown in various studies as a crucial factor in the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Complement alternative pathway has been linked to the excessive inflammation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in which decreased levels of factor H (FH) and elevated levels of properdin (FP) were observed. The current study investigated the potential immune protective roles of FP and FH against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods The interactions between FH and FP and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated using direct ELISA. The cell binding and luciferase-based viral entry assays utilising S protein expressing lentiviral pseudotypes were used to evaluate the possible modulatory effects of FH, FP, and recombinant thrombospondin repeats 4 and 5 (TSR4 + 5) on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Using RT-qPCR, we also assessed the immunomodulatory roles of FH and FP in the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Results FH and FP were found to bind to both the RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The treatment of FP or TSR4 + 5 enhanced cell binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes that was administered in A549 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells). FP increases the affinity between host ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2, according to in silico work. In A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells, the effect of FP on viral cell entry and binding was counteracted by anti-FP antibody treatment. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes’ cell entry and binding were decreased by FH treatment. The A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 alphaviral pseudotypes (expressing spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins) pre-treated with FP or TSR4+5 showed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts, including NF-κB and IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α, and RANTES. Contrary to this, the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated by FH treatment. FH treatment decreased S protein-mediated NF-κB activation, but FP treatment enhanced it in A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells. Discussion These results imply that FH may function as a SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and binding inhibitor, reducing the inflammatory response linked to infection independently of complement activation. FP could aid cell viral entry and binding and aggravate hyperinflammation that might contribute to the severity of the infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Airborne transmissibility of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in humans is considered an essential component of their pandemic risk. Although several viral factors regulating airborne transmission (AT) have been delineated, it is not known what, if any, responses at the respiratory epithelia are determinants of AIV AT. Using responses in the ferret nasal epithelium to a panel of H1N1 AIVs, we describe host responses that segregate with AT phenotypes. AIV infection upregulated interferon alpha and gamma responses and IL-6 JAK-STAT signaling and downregulated oxidative phosphorylation. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that cellular genotoxic stress and NF-kB, interferon, and cell fate pathways differentiated host responses to AIVs with different transmissibilities. These responses culminated in greater AIV antigen-containing exudate and debris in the respiratory spaces of the nasal epithelium of ferrets inoculated with AT AIVs. More abundant CMPK2, SP100, and CXCL10 transcription in infected epithelia was a hallmark of AT viruses. Overall, our study reveals host responses associated with AIV infection and transmission in the nasal epithelium, the determinant anatomical site of influenza virus transmission. IMPORTANCE Airborne transmission (AT) is a critical component of the pandemic risks posed by avian influenza A viruses (AIVs). However, the host responses ultimately dictating transmissibility elicited by AIVs in the upper respiratory tract of mammals, the determinant site of influenza virus AT, are largely unknown. We identified host responses in the nasal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract differentially expressed in response to infection by AIVs of different mammalian ATs. Our data indicate that a definable host response was associated with AT of AIVs. These data would serve as an important basis for future mechanistic studies of AIV zoonosis and potentially have implications for understanding the mechanisms of transmission of respiratory viruses between humans.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT RNA viruses have high mutation frequency, quick generation periods and vast population numbers, which promote fast evolution and host environment adaptation. We integrated scRNA‐seq and spatial transcriptomics to profile immune cells and viral gene expression in COVID‐19. Cell types and interactions were identified using Seurat‐based tools. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed viral hotspots, and GISAID data were used to track SARS‐CoV‐2 mutations. Single‐cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses revealed that immune cells such as Neutrophils, Monocyte:CD14 + , and T cell:CD4+ central memory are highly abundant in COVID‐19 patients, particularly in mild and severe cases, and are concentrated in the central and upper regions of lung tissue. Pseudotime and CellChat analyses indicated that cell differentiation trajectories and communication networks shift toward heightened inflammatory responses in severe conditions. Spatial analysis of viral gene expression showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 genes, especially Nucleoprotein, Spike and Envelope were highly expressed in central and upper‐right tissue regions, suggesting active viral replication. This localized viral activity was strongly associated with areas of immune cell infiltration and inflammation. The top 10 sustainable mutants in SARS‐CoV‐2 genome with high frequency were observed in NSP12 (P323L, 99%, Switzerland), Spike (D614G, 97%, Switzerland), NSP4 (T492I, 79%, Switzerland), NSP6 (T77A, 70%, Guangdong), Orf9c (G50N, 64%, England), Nucleoprotein (D377Y, 62%, United States), Orf9b (T60A, 61%, France), NSP14 (I42V, 55%, United States), Envelope (T9I, 51.3%, Trinidad and Tobago), and NSP5 (P132H, 51.2%, United States). Following to this approach is crucial for a strong epidemiological reaction against the changing SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with cytotoxic activity against tumors and viruses. The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the investigation of their role in disease severity. However, their functional status and modulators remain controversial. Recent studies highlighted the role of metabolism in immune function, but metabolic changes in NK cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unexplored. This study compares metabolic (SIRT1, AMPKA, HIF1A, and GLUT1) and inflammatory (NFKB1, NFKB1A, IFNG, and SOCS1) gene expression, and flow cytometry-based assessment of functional markers in NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients (n=15) and the control group (n=10), and their association with clinical outcomes. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated IFNγ, Granzyme B, and KIR2DL1 expression in NK cells compared to controls (P < 0.005), while LAMP1 was unchanged (P > 0.05). NK cells from deceased patients exhibited significantly lower expression levels of LAMP1 and Granzyme B (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized >7 days presented lower Granzyme-B+ NK cells (P < 0.05). NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients showed downregulation of HIF1A and GLUT1, and upregulation of NFKB1 (P < 0.05). HIF1A and GLUT1 expression were elevated in patients with >7 days of hospitalization (P < 0.05). SIRT1 expression was higher in patients requiring intubation (P < 0.05). SIRT1, HIF1A, and GLUT1 were upregulated in deceased patients (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrate that NK cells from patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit increased functional markers and dysregulated metabolic gene expression associated with clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became the dominant driver during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high transmissibility and immune escape potential. Although clinical outcomes are generally mild to moderate, the inflammatory mechanisms triggered by Omicron subvariants remain poorly defined. The goal of this study was to consider both viral evolution and the host immune response by assessing plasma cytokine levels in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Methods: A total of 115 individuals were recruited, including 40 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR. Demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data were collected. Plasma levels of IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17A were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array. Subvariant data were obtained from GISAID records and grouped into early (BA.1-lineage) and late (BA.4/BA.5-lineage) Omicron clusters. Statistical analysis included non-parametric and parametric tests, correlation matrices, and multivariate comparisons. Results: Pharyngitis, nasal discharge, cough, and headache were the most common symptoms among infected individuals. Despite no significant variation in symptom distribution across subvariants, infected patients showed higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-2 compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in early Omicron infections. No associations were observed between cytokine levels and comorbidities. A significant correlation was found between reporting fewer symptoms and having received three vaccine doses. Conclusions: Infection with Omicron subvariants elicits a strong yet balanced cytokine response. Despite genetic divergence between lineages, immune and clinical patterns remain conserved, with vaccination appearing to mitigate the symptom burden.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes, along with cytokines and chemokines-dependent pathways are primarily responsible for regulating the immune response, controlling inflammation and eliminating viral infections. However, excessive immune activity can lead to pathological effects such as cytokine storm, which may cause severe respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ damage in COVID-19. The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 infection that could predict the severity of COVID-19 progression.The cohort in this study included 52 hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Warsaw, Poland admitted to the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic (February to November 2021). Based on clinical symptoms, patients were divided into two groups: (i) mild/moderate symptoms (non-severe) – 44 patients and (ii) severe respiratory failure (severe) – 8 patients. The control group consisted of 26 individuals without COVID-19. All COVID-19 patients and healthy controls underwent immunophenotyping of peripheral blood to assess the abundance of T lymphocytes and regulatory T lymphocytes, as well as measurement of selected cytokine and chemokine concentrations in corresponding serum samples. Data analysis was performed using CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer. Decreased percentages of total lymphocytes and T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were observed across all COVID-19 patients, with varying degrees between the non-severe and severe groups. A significant reduction was also noted in double-positive lymphocytes (CD4+CD8+), regulatory T lymphocytes ( CD4+ CD25HiCD127Lo and CD4+CD25HiCD127LoFoxP3+), as well as CD4+CD25+/-, CD4+CD45RA+/-, and CD8+CD45RA+/- subsets. Elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-g, CCL2, CXCL8, and CXCL10 were observed in the non-severe and/or severe groups compared to healthy controls. Most importantly, only CXCL10 was significantly elevated in the severe group at admission compared to the non-severe group. In this study, we identified the chemokine CXCL10 as a crucial marker for distinguishing the severe course of COVID-19 from non-severe form at the time of admission. It may serve as an early indicator of diseases progression during hospitalization, potentially allowing prediction of the disease course. Moreover, elevated CXCL10 levels, in combination with decreased total lymphocytes counts and increased levels of IL-6, IL10, IFNg, CCL2 and CXCL9, may represent a more comprehensive biomarker panel suitable for predicting the severity of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a health risk for humans and other domestic and wildlife species. Recently, North American elk have been identified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a potential threat to humans and other mammals. In this work, we characterized the peripheral transcriptomic response to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in calves and adult elk at different time points. Results Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified at 2-, 5-, and 14-days post inoculation (pi) for both age groups. Adult elk presented the greatest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes at all time points, including many genes associated with viral response, immune activation, antibody production, as well as genes associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and coronavirus GO terms and KEGG pathways. Calves presented DE genes associated with viral responses at 5 days pi as well as neurodegenerative-associated genes at 14 days pi. Both adults and calves showed predicted activation of the ISGF3 and IFN type I pathways at day 2 pi and, globally, increased activity related to the coronavirus pathway disease at 5 and 14 days pi. Conclusions Collectively, this work provides valuable data characterizing the cervid immune response of elk to viral diseases as well as the response of wildlife to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="Background Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe complication that arises between two and six weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms underlying why only a subset of children develop this hyperinflammatory response remain unclear. Methods We performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of plasma samples from children before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those who developed MIS-C. Proteomic profiling was conducted using high-throughput technologies, and findings were validated using publicly available datasets. Results Healthy children showed minimal changes in the circulating proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no evidence of ongoing inflammation. In contrast, children with MIS-C exhibited significant activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and elevated circulating markers of myocardial and vascular injury. Conclusions Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection alone does not cause sustained proteomic alterations in most children. However, MIS-C is associated with a distinct inflammatory and vascular injury signature. Several candidate diagnostic biomarkers for MIS-C were identified and validated in silico, offering promising avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="As an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits remarkable contagiousness and has emerged as a critical global public health concern. In critically ill patients, virus-induced cytokine storms and resulting multi-organ failure represent significant therapeutic challenges. In our clinical observations, we identified that this hyperinflammatory state was correlated with reduced mRNA expression of both Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-like Protein 2 (TIPE2)—an immune negative modulator—and the ferroptosis marker gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients. Given the emerging evidence that macrophage polarization and dysfunction play pivotal roles in COVID-19 progression, we established a THP-1-derived macrophage model stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to mimic the host immune response. Our results demonstrated that TIPE2 modulates S protein-induced macrophage polarization and ferroptosis, specifically by suppressing M1 polarization associated with inflammation and encouraging M2 polarization linked to anti-inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TIPE2 mediates critical immunomodulatory effects during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating pathological inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients gravely affected.

        <tr id="Background Macrophages play pivotal roles in immune homeostasis and host defense against pathogens, yet their excessive activation can lead to tissue damage. Acute peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is associated with dysregulated macrophage-mediated inflammation. IKZF1, a transcription factor, has been implicated in immune regulation, but its role in CLP-induced macrophage activation remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of IKZF1 in regulating inflammatory responses during acute peritonitis. Method Using a murine CLP-induced peritonitis model, we analyzed IKZF1 expression in macrophages via RT-qPCR and western blot. Lenalidomide (Len), an IKZF1 inhibitor, was administered to assess its effects on macrophage inflammation and lung injury. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATP levels, and succinate accumulation. Mechanistic studies included chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and HDAC3 activity assays. SDHB expression and acetylation status were analyzed under LPS stimulation, with acetate supplementation used to modulate histone H3K9 acetylation. Results IKZF1 expression was significantly upregulated in macrophages during CLP-induced peritonitis. Len treatment suppressed IKZF1, attenuating inflammatory responses and mitigating lung injury. Mechanistically, IKZF1 directly repressed SDHB expression by recruiting HDAC3 to deacetylate SDHB, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and amplified inflammation. Supplementation with acetate restored H3K9ac levels at the SDHB promoter, counteracting LPS-induced suppression of SDHB. These findings highlight an IKZF1/HDAC3-SDHB-succinate axis driving macrophage hyperactivation. Conclusion IKZF1 exacerbates macrophage inflammation in CLP-induced peritonitis by epigenetically silencing SDHB via HDAC3-mediated deacetylation, thereby disrupting mitochondrial metabolism and amplifying pro-inflammatory signals. Targeting IKZF1 or enhancing acetylation may represent novel therapeutic strategies for acute inflammatory conditions. This study establishes IKZF1 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for mitigating excessive inflammation in peritonitis.">

        <tr id="Sex-based differences in the immune system influence the clinical course of infectious diseases, including many parasitic infections. Field studies of human infections and controlled experimental rodent models have shown that certain clinical forms of leishmaniasis occur more frequently in males. Leishmania parasites infect and proliferate in innate immune cells, particularly macrophages, and modulate early immune responses that constrain their survival and replication. In this study, we used a high-throughput in vitro system to assess sex differences in human macrophage-specific immunity to Leishmania (L.) infantum infection. Quantification of infection showed significantly higher infection rates and parasite loads in macrophages derived from men compared to those from women up to 76 hours post-infection (hpi). Evaluation of the macrophage phenotype during L. infantum infection revealed only minor changes in the proportions of primarily proinflammatory M1-like macrophages, whereas a reduction in the anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype was observed in both sexes. Cytokine profiling revealed elevated levels of TNF, IL-8, IL-10, and reduced levels of IL-18 and CCL2 in culture supernatants over the time of infection. Transcriptomic analysis showed the highest adaptation of gene expression at 6 hpi, which was more pronounced in female-derived macrophages (1428 down-regulated/2145 up-regulated genes) compared to male-derived macrophages (972 down-regulated/1637 up-regulated genes), and gradually decreased over time in both sexes. Genes associated with type I interferon responses (e.g., IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, OASL, JAK1), specific cytokine response (IL-15, IL-1R1), and the matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 were up-regulated in female macrophages, while genes encoding proinflammatory chemokines involved in immune cell recruitment (CXCL1, CXCL3, CCL20, CCL7) were up-regulated in male macrophages. Treatment of infected macrophages with estradiol conferred marginal resistance to infection in female-derived macrophages, whereas testosterone treatment had no effect. In summary, our findings reveal immune mediators and underscore a biological sex difference that may explain females’ superior ability to combat Leishmania infections.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2029 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which enters the human body via the respiratory route and can infect nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, goblet cells, hair cells, pneumocytes, etc. COVID-19 caused the worst pandemic in centuries. SARS-CoV-2, once in the airway tree, penetrates the host cells and causes a strong inflammatory reaction by a rapid response of the innate immune system, in particular by activation of macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize the virus component proteins as non-self. Cells of the immune system secrete type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, initiating an antiviral state in neighboring cells and in the intercellular connective matrix, recruiting new immune mediators and new cells to the site of infection. This rapid response is crucial for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we aimed at highlighting some microscopic aspects of the acute inflammatory reaction in the lung for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of the histological pieces suggested that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction begins with the accumulation of immune cells in the interalveolar septa in response to viral insult, congestion of pulmonary vessels with increased blood volume in pulmonary vessels, followed by the presence of alveolar exudate, which reduces the area of hematosis and triggers respiratory symptoms. The inflammatory reaction was totally inhomogeneous, varying widely from patient to patient and even within the same patient, probably depending on the immune status, age or comorbidities. It presented two phases, a predominantly exudative phase (EP) and a predominantly proliferative phase (PP), intricately intertwined; sometimes, on the same histopathological piece, we identified both areas of incipient inflammatory reaction (EP) and a very intense reaction in the PP, suggesting that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction developed rapidly. The inflammatory infiltrate had a complex composition: neutrophilic leukocytes, macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The most abundant inflammatory cells were macrophages, both in the EP and PP. The use of anti-interleukin (IL) antibodies showed that ILs are mainly produced by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, but also by conjunctival cells (fibroblasts).">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 infection initiates at mucosal surfaces, and mucosal immunity may influence the nature and severity of infection. Little is known about the induction of mucosal immunity by vaccination in COVID-19 convalescents. Methods: Sera from 205 healthcare workers were collected one month after the first Covishield vaccination and 1/3/6 months after the second vaccination, while paired sera and stimulated whole-mouth fluid (SWMF) was collected 1/3/6 months after the third vaccination (N = 10) and at 0/30/90 days after a COVID-19 episode (N = 8). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody detection by ECLIA/ELISA and cytokine detection by ELISA/CBA were performed. Results: One month post-second vaccination, serum antibodies had increased significantly (6-fold) in the COVID-19-naïve group (CNG) but declined (1.5-fold) in the previously COVID-19-exposed group (CEG), who already had high antibody titres. The serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 levels were higher after three antigen exposures (p = 0.0002). New infections (breakthrough infections—BTIs) or reinfections (RIs) with asymptomatic/mild disease occurred in 44% of the CNG and 27% of the CEG (p < 0.01). The mucosal cytokine IL-17 levels were significantly higher in the CEG. Salivary IgG/IgA and secretory IgA antibodies were detectable both after vaccination and COVID-19. Innate cytokines (MIG, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-1β) were higher and sustained in SWMF in contrast to serum. Conclusions: Two vaccinations in the CNG resulted in an antibody boost, but the second vaccination in the CEG induced antibody anergy. Serum/mucosal antibodies declined by six months after vaccination, but the rapid increase at subsequent exposures were indicative of a good T cell/B cell memory response to SARS-CoV-2. A higher percentage of BTI among the CNG than RI among the CEG may indicate better protection due to higher antibody responses in the latter group.">

        <tr id="Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) initiates secondary inflammatory processes that exacerbate tissue damage, with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) playing a significant role in amplifying these cascades. This study aimed to explore the temporal dynamics and key regulatory genes of NET formation in SCI to identify therapeutic targets. Methods We integrated two transcriptomic datasets from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed NETs-related genes (NRGs) in SCI. WGCNA identified SCI-related modules, while GSVA assessed NET formation dynamics. Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database determined cell-specific expression patterns of key NRGs. Findings were validated through immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qPCR in a mouse SCI model. Regulatory networks were constructed, and potential therapeutic compounds were predicted using DSigDB and molecular docking. Results We identified seven key NRGs (Casp1, Ccl3, Fcgr2b, Itgam, Itgb2, Tlr2, Tlr4) in SCI. GSVA revealed peak NET score at day 1 post-injury, with attenuation at days 3 and 7. Single-cell transcriptome analysis demonstrated predominant expression of these key genes in neutrophils during the acute phase, most prominently at 1 day post-injury, which coincides with the most pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses confirmed significantly elevated NET formation at 1 day post-SCI. qPCR verified the expression of all key NRGs. Regulatory network analysis identified CHD1 as an important transcription factor governing NET formation, while miRNA-mRNA network construction revealed sophisticated post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms. Drug prediction analysis identified atorvastatin as a promising therapeutic candidate with strong binding affinity to multiple key NET-related proteins. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the temporal dynamics and molecular mechanisms of NET formation after SCI, identifying potential therapeutic targets to mitigate neutrophil-mediated secondary injury and improve functional outcomes.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

        <tr id="Vaccines played a crucial role in the COVID-19 pandemic, but their long-term biological effects and efficacy in vulnerable populations remain under intensive investigation. This study assessed clinical outcomes, comorbidities, and systemic biomarker and proteomic profiles in 366 multimorbid patients, stratified into four groups based on SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination status (COV+ vac+, COV+ vac−, COV− vac+, COV− vac−). Clinical and laboratory data, including comorbidities and relevant biomarkers, were collected. Proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry was performed to identify molecular changes associated with infection and vaccination. Statistical analyses examined associations between clinical status, biomarkers, and patient outcomes. As most participants received mRNA-based vaccines, the results primarily reflect responses to spike protein-expressing platforms. Biomarkers of cardiac and renal stress—namely proBNP and carbamide—were elevated in vaccinated individuals. Five deaths occurred in the COV+ vac+ group and two in the COV+ vac− group, most of which were attributed to exacerbations of pre-existing chronic diseases rather than to COVID-19 pneumonia. Protection against breakthrough infections waned over time, particularly beyond 200 days post-vaccination. Mass spectrometry identified proteins such as actin, fibrinogen chains, and SAA2 as potential diagnostic targets. Although the cross-sectional observational design limits the ability to draw causal inferences, the observed waning immunity and potential systemic alterations in vaccinated multimorbid patients highlight the importance of longitudinal follow-up to guide tailored immunization strategies and post-vaccination monitoring in high-risk groups.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are crucial innate immune cells that play important roles during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Ex vivo human precision‐cut lung slices (PCLSs) are well‐suited models to study immune reactions and biochemical changes within host cells as well as to follow functional macrophage phenotype plasticity within complex tissue environment. Raman spectroscopy emerged in recent years as a powerful method for label‐free cell characterization. Methods Human PCLSs from one donor were infected with either the SARS‐CoV‐2 delta or omicron variant. Immunofluorescence microscopy localized AMs and virus particles. Cytokine levels of interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) and interleukin 18 (IL‐18) were quantified. The lung slice model was optimized for label‐free Raman spectroscopic imaging and for the characterization of single AMs within the three‐dimensional structure of the PCLS model. Results Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the location of AMs and virus particles within the PCLS model. Raman spectroscopic imaging generated false‐colour images, revealing distinct spectroscopic differences between AMs in the uninfected control PCLS model and those in PCLS models infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. These differences included variations in intracellular RNA, carotenoid, triacyl glyceride, and glucose levels, consistent in interpretation with cytokine quantification data. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification model achieved an 83% accuracy in distinguishing cells from infected lung slices from those of the uninfected controls. The LDA loadings pointed to spectral bands that had been previously identified in an in vitro stimulation study of macrophages. Conclusions Raman spectroscopy can characterize the cellular immune response and phenotype plasticity of AMs to infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 within a PCLS model in a label‐free and non‐invasive manner. The ability to distinguish cells from infected PCLSs from cells of the uninfected control PCLS based on intracellular biochemical changes highlights the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a powerful diagnostic tool in immunology and clinical diagnostics.">

        <tr id="Background Systemic inflammation is a critical clinical condition regularly observed in the context of surgery-induced trauma or infection. Systemic inflammation induces an ubiquitous activation of the vasculature and vascular dysfunction related to organ damage and adverse outcomes. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) modulates the receptor preferences and activity of a multitude of humoral substrates mediating the systemic inflammatory response. We here determined whether DPP4 inhibition is a means to beneficially modulate systemic inflammatory responses affecting vascular and organ integrity. Methods In cardiac surgery patients medicated with DPP4 inhibitors, we used a systems biology approach for in-depth characterization of the perioperative immune response and assessment of macro- and microvascular dynamics compared to control patients. In parallel, we mechanistically evaluated the efficacy of DPP4 inhibition on modulating immune responses, capillary leakage, vasoplegia and endothelial transcriptomic profiles in mice with severe systemic inflammation. Results Preoperative oral intake of the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin modulated innate and adaptive immune phenotypes and was associated with augmented microvascluar integrity, reduced vasoplegia and improved clinical parameters of capillary leakage in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In mice, DPP4 inhibition curbed the inflammatory response to a polymicrobial sepsis resulting in a massive reduction in endothelial gene activation assoicated with preserved vascular barrier function, augmented vasopressor responses and organ integrity. Conclusions We conclude that DPP4 inhibition may be a safe and potent means to curb immune responses to surgery or infection, resulting in a preservation of vascular integrity that translates into organ protection and improved clinical outcomes.

        <tr id="The non-polio enteroviruses enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) and enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71) are highly prevalent and considered pathogens of increasing health concern. While most enterovirus infections are mild and self-limiting, severe complications ranging from meningitis, encephalitis, to acute flaccid paralysis can occur, especially in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite the global burden of neurological complications caused by EV-D68 and EV-A71, the underlying neuropathogenesis remains poorly understood. In particular, the impact of the infection on neural function has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we compare the replication kinetics, cellular tropism, and electrophysiological effects of EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection in a physiologically relevant human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural co-culture model, consisting of excitatory neurons and astrocytes. Inoculation with contemporary circulating EV-D68 strains and an EV-A71 strain resulted in decreased neural activity in the co-cultures, with EV-D68 A2/2018 inducing the most rapid and robust negative effect on neural co-cultures, followed by EV-D68 B3/2019. EV-D68 strains preferentially infected neurons, whereas EV-A71 infection was detected in both cell types to the same extent. Despite the lack of viral release of infectious virus particles of EV-D68 B3/2019 in the supernatant, the infection could spread in the cultures and reduce neurotransmission. Higher viral load and broader tropism of EV-A71 did not result in enhanced impairment of neural function. Our results demonstrate that neurotropic non-polio enteroviruses lead to disruption of spontaneous neural activity in a virus-specific manner, which does not correlate with their replication efficiency.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has prompted extensive research into factors influencing the onset and severity of the disease. Among these factors, the role of the nasopharyngeal microbiome, a vital ecosystem critical for respiratory health and immune modulation, remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between the composition of nasopharyngeal microbiota and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 during the initial phase of infection. Materials and methods A total of 81 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from individuals in Central Greece between January and February 2021. Following quality control, 77 samples were selected for microbiome analysis. This selection included SARS-CoV-2-negative controls (NE, n = 26) and SARS-CoV-2-positive patients classified as asymptomatic (AS, n = 19), mild (MI, n = 16), or severe (SE, n = 16) based on clinical criteria. All COVID-19-positive samples were collected within 2 days of symptom onset, and participants with recent hospitalization or antibiotic use were excluded. Microbiome profiling was performed using 16S rRNA gene-targeted metagenomic sequencing, followed by comprehensive bioinformatics and statistical analyses. Results Significant differences were observed in both alpha and beta diversity measures, with alpha diversity decreasing as the severity of COVID-19 increased. Three of the four individual study groups, namely NE, MI, and SE, exhibited distinct microbial profiles, while the asymptomatic group showed greater heterogeneity. Significant variations in the abundance of specific phyla, families, and genera were identified between the different study groups. When comparing the NE and SE groups, we observed a significant increase in the abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum in the SE group, while the abundance of Fusobacteria was significantly lower in the SE group. In symptomatic COVID-19 patients, we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of key family constituents of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, such as Fusobacteriaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Streptococcaceae, suggesting a disruption in microbial homeostasis during the infection. Conversely, we found an increased prevalence of families associated with pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, in the SE group, suggesting a potential role of these taxa in the disease progression of COVID-19. Conclusion These findings shed light on specific genera that undergo significant changes during COVID-19 infection and contribute to our understanding of the dynamic nature of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in relation to disease progression and severity.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus that establishes lifelong latent infection in CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A unique subset of viral genes is expressed during latency, which functions to modulate cellular mechanisms without supporting viral replication. One potential function of these genes is to regulate the differentiation state of latently infected CD34+ cells, thereby preventing their progression into antigen-presenting cells, e.g., dendritic cells. In this study, we first compared CD34+ cells that supported productive and latent infections using the RV-TB40-BACKL7-SE-EGFP virus. Over a seven-day time course, the proportion of latently infected CD34+ cell subsets within the myeloid progenitor population remained similar to that in the mock-infected control. However, starting from day 3 post-infection, there was an increase in the proportion of the early progenitor subsets, including haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs). In contrast, productively infected cells, which constituted less than 1% of the population, only accounted for a small portion of the myeloid progenitors. Importantly, our data revealed that the innate immune STING/p-TBK1/p-IRF3 pathway was activated in latently infected CD34+ cells, yet type I interferon (IFN) expression was decreased. This decrease was attributed to impaired p-IRF3 nuclear translocation, limiting the induction of an autocrine type I IFN response. However, treatment with IFN-β could induce myelopoiesis in latently infected cells. In summary, HCMV modulates a key component of the STING pathway to inhibit antiviral immune responses by decreasing the type I IFN-mediated cell differentiation of CD34+ progenitor cells. This study uncovered a new mechanism of latent HCMV-mediated regulation of the host cell differentiation response.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background PDLIM2, a PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein expressed highest in the lung and immune cells, serves as a unique tumor suppressor and immune modulator, mainly by turning off the activation of the master transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3. While its role in cancer is established, the involvement of PDLIM2 in viral infection remains unclear. Results Here, we analyzed public gene expression data of blood leukocytes, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lung tissues from uninfected healthy humans and those infected with the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We found that PDLIM2 expression was repressed by viral infection, and notably, this repression correlated with the severity of infectious diseases. Consistently, the expression level of PDLIM2 was negatively associated with NF-κB and STAT3 activity across a diverse range of cell types, such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, alveolar type 1 and 2 epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Accordingly, cells with low PDLIM2 expression exhibited aberrant activation of signaling pathways essential for cellular functions and immune responses. Conclusions These findings highlight PDLIM2 repression as a common mechanism underlying human viral infectious diseases and suggest PDLIM2 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for disease prognosis, prevention, and treatment.">

The primary outcome was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, up to 60 days after intervention. Secondary outcomes were PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 and serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, up to 150 days after intervention.Of 3411 randomised participants, the modified intention-to-treat population included 1607 in the MCV and 1545 in the saline group. The estimated risk of symptomatic COVID-19 by 60 days was 1.5% in the MCV and 1.2% in the saline group (risk difference, 0.3 percentage points, 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.1; p=0.52). At 150 days, these percentages were 4.1% (65/1585) and 4.1% (64/1544) in the MCV and saline groups, respectively (risk difference, 0.04 percentage points, 95% CI, -1.4 to 1.3; p=0.95). Based on serology results available at 0 and 150 days, 10.6% (100/945) of participants in the MCV and 10.3% (98/951) in the saline group had infection with SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the trial (risk difference, 0.3 percentage points, 95% CI, -2.6 to 3.1; p=0.84).

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity is an important correlate of protection against respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2. Comparing B cell responses in the upper respiratory tract following vaccination and infection may offer unique insights into mucosal immunity. Here, we characterized antigen-specific B cells in the tonsils, adenoids, and peripheral blood of children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-specific switched memory B cells (BSM) and germinal center B cells were found in the blood and pharyngeal lymphoid tissues after vaccination or infection. However, infection generated a higher proportion of IgA+ BSM and CXCR3+CD21+ BSM, which showed distinct spatial localization, greater clonal expansion and increased propensity for plasma cell differentiation compared to their CXCR3− counterparts, accompanied by persistent activation of innate and T follicular helper cells in the tissues. Our data provide evidence for tissue-specific B cell memory after either SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, but with distinct characteristics that can influence the quality, durability, and localization of immunity.">

We used an activation-induced marker (AIM) assay and single-cell transcriptomic sequencing to analyze SARS-CoV-2 spike-responsive T cells after mild SARS-CoV-2 infection or after one or two doses of mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) or adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings revealed broad functional and clonal heterogeneity in T cells generated by vaccination or infection, including multiple distinct effector populations. T cell function was largely conserved between COVID-19 vaccine platforms but was distinct compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the dosing interval greatly influenced the quality of T cells after two vaccine doses, particularly after mRNA-LNP vaccination, where a longer interval led to reduced inflammatory signaling and increased secondary proliferation.

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from all cells of the body. They are considered to mirror the state of the cells from which they are released and circulate in the blood, suggesting a possible use of EV analysis for diagnostic purposes. Here, we report that the analysis of single EVs by flow cytometry can detect infection of cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by identifying expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein on the surface of EVs and the cellular origin of EVs by detecting cell-type-specific markers such as troponin (cTNT1) for cardiomyocytes. In coronavirus-associated disease 19 (COVID-19) patients, we detected a direct correlation of the frequencies of circulating S-expressing EVs, but not of cTNT/S-co-expressing EVs, with the subsequent development of a severe disease course. Detection of circulating S-expressing EVs indicates widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection in the body, which may contribute to the immune pathogenesis that triggers tissue and organ damage in COVID-19. Our findings suggest that detecting circulating viral antigen-expressing EVs may provide crucial predictive information on infection-associated disease courses in situations of a future viral pandemic.IMPORTANCEThe ability to predict which patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus will develop severe disease remains a significant clinical challenge. The present study demonstrates that EVs in the peripheral blood, carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, can be detected by flow cytometry and serve as early biomarkers of disease progression. In contradistinction to PCR or serology, this method provides insight into systemic viral spread and potential organ involvement. The early identification of spike-positive EVs at the time of hospital admission has the potential to facilitate the timely identification of high-risk patients, thereby enhancing the efficacy of triage and subsequent care. This approach may also be of value in terms of facilitating a more rapid and precise response to future virus pandemics.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 7 million deaths, but its legacy extends beyond mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immune alterations that persist post-recovery, manifesting not only in long COVID (LC) but also in healthy individuals. Cytokines serve as critical orchestrators of these processes. The goal of this study is to investigate post-pandemic immune remodeling through cytokine assessment in both patients with LC and healthy donor, and to compare the post-pandemic population with pre-pandemic controls to find changes in the immune responses and cytokine profiles. A panel of 47 immune mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) was measured with the MAGPIX multiplex analysis. LC was characterized by an increase in IL-7, IL-8, IL-17F, IL-18, EGF, FGF-2, PDGF-AA, sCD40L, and MCP-3 and a decrease in IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-27, and FLT-3L. Comparing post-pandemic recovered individuals with pre-pandemic healthy cohort, we saw an upregulation of IL-13 and MCP-3 and a downregulation of MDC, M-CSF, IL-12, and IL-17F. While LC is characterized by persistent immune imbalance—particularly in cytokine networks—our data emphasize the critical need to study healthy donors in both pre- and post-pandemic eras when analyzing and interpreting these changes.">

        <tr id="Introduction Pediatric isolates of SARS-CoV-2 remain underrepresented in virologic studies, despite their importance for understanding viral diversity and therapeutic responses. Methods Nasal swab and saliva samples were collected from pediatric COVID-19 patients. Viral isolation was attempted in Vero cells through five blind passages. Replication was assessed by digital RT-PCR, while cytopathic effects were observed microscopically. Genomic sequencing was conducted using next-generation sequencing, and antiviral activity was evaluated for Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, and Nirmatrelvir. Results A SARS-CoV-2 strain, designated N15, was successfully isolated from a pediatric nasal swab. The isolate replicated efficiently in Vero cells with kinetics comparable to B.1 and B.1.1.529 lineages. Cytopathic effects appeared within 48 h post-infection, marked by aggregates of dead cells. Genomic analysis classified N15 within lineage 19B, showing 99.9% similarity to the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Rare mutations were identified: N709S in the spike protein and T11M in the E protein. Antiviral testing revealed effective inhibition by Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, and Nirmatrelvir, with varying IC50 values across cell types. Discussion The pediatric N15 isolate represents a unique 19B lineage virus, retaining ancestral genomic features while harboring rare mutations. Its efficient replication and drug sensitivity underscore its value as a reference strain for comparative studies against circulating variants and for evaluating antiviral efficacy.">

        <tr id="Clinical evidence has associated H1N1 influenza with liver impairment, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated H1N1-induced liver damage and its potential mechanisms using a BALB/c mouse infection model. Pathological examination and serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were assessed. Messenger ribonucleic acid-sequence was used to analyze the transcriptomic changes in tissues. Multiple inflammatory cytokines in tissues and inflammatory cells in the blood were detected on the fifth day post-infection. Our results showed that H1N1 infection caused significant liver pathology and elevated serum AST/ALT levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in liver gene expression profiles following H1N1 infection, particularly in genes associated with inflammatory responses, including those involved in monocyte adhesion/activation and neutrophil/macrophage infiltration. Marked increases in inflammatory mediators were observed in lungs, serum, and liver, accompanied by systemic changes in circulating inflammatory cells, indicating H1N1 triggered a robust systemic inflammatory response. These findings suggest that H1N1-induced liver damage may be associated with the systemic inflammatory response induced by H1N1 and changes in liver gene regulation.">

        <tr id="Insulin resistance is one of the metabolic complications of COVID-19. Our previous study showed a 22% median increase in homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in obese individuals at 12 months post-infection compared to acute infection. This study aimed to investigate the association between various subsets of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8 + T cells and insulin resistance in convalescent COVID-19 patients over a one-year post-infection follow-up period. A nested case control study of 47 COVID-19 patients was followed for 12 months post-infection and categorized into three groups based on obesity and changes in HOMA-IR at one year: non-obese without increased HOMA-IR (NO), obese without increased HOMA-IR (O), and obese with increased HOMA-IR (O-IR). Increased HOMA-IR was defined as a HOMA-IR ratio (12-month to 1-month convalescence phase) > 1.21. To study antigen-specific responses, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s were isolated and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 peptide antigens for 24 h. Intracellular IFN-γ expression, as well as exhaustion and senescence markers, in various CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were measured by flow cytometry. The abundance of IFN-γ-expressing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells was lower in the O-IR group compared to individuals without increased HOMA-IR during the 9th to 12th months of follow-up (p < 0.05). Conversely, the O-IR group exhibited a mild but significantly higher IFN-γ-expressing CD8+ T cells from the 3rd to the 9th month of the convalescence phase (p < 0.05). A reduced proportion of functional (PD-1−CD57−) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed in O-IR group. Furthermore, the reduced proportion of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells observed within 12 months of convalescence were have significant weak negative correlation with HOMA-IR ratio as well as HOMA-IR value. Our study demonstrates that obese individuals with increased HOMA-IR exhibited a reduced proportion of IFN-γ–expressing functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4⁺ T cells one year after COVID-19. This reduction, along with the decreased frequencies of both functional CD4⁺ within 12 months of convalescence, suggests a potential association between impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell function and the development of insulin resistance following COVID-19. These findings warrant further investigation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-11714-3.">

        <tr id="Background From a public health perspective it is remarkable that there are yet no longitudinal studies in the general population investigating the influence of the basal immune state, measured before the pandemic, on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Objective To investigate the specific and combined effects of personal levels of cytokines and immunoglobulins—measured in individuals’ blood 4 years before the pandemic—on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in a general population. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in 240 individuals from the general population of Barcelona. Thirty cytokines and 31 immunoglobulins were quantified in prepandemic serum samples (collected in 2016–17) by high-throughput multiplex quantitative suspension array technology. Results Higher concentrations in 2016–17 of IL-8 and TNF-α significantly decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in 2020–21, whereas higher concentrations of MIP-1α were a risk factor for seropositivity. Most cytokines in mixtures with IL-8, MIP-1α, TNF-α or G-CSF were associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (all OR ≥2.0 or OR≤0.4 and p < 0.05). The five individual isotype-antigen pairs more clearly associated with seropositivity were: protectively, IgG to CMV pp150, IgG to CMV pp65, and IgG to N OC43; and, increasing risk of seropositivity, IgM to CMV pp65 and IgM to EBV EA-D. The four cytokines most consistently associated with the risk of COVID-19 were also G-CSF, IL-8, TNF-α, and MIP-1α. The four isotype-antigen pairs more strongly associated with risk of COVID-19 (all protective) were IgA to CMV pp65 and N 229E, and IgG to EBV EAD and VCAp18. Conclusion The unique longitudinal design of this study, with measurements before and during the pandemic in a general population, provides novel knowledge on the protective and detrimental effects of specific individual cytokines and immunoglobulins, and their mixtures, on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and COVID-19. If confirmed, findings would be significantly relevant for medicine and public health.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Many SARS‐CoV‐2 patients experience chronic pulmonary symptoms and long‐term inflammation despite viral clearance. While these clinical manifestations have been linked to the dysregulation of the adaptive immune response, the underlying immunopathology remains poorly understood due to a lack of suitable animal models. To investigate long‐term pulmonary consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, we used a genetic cross of 129 mice and C57BL/6 (B6)‐K18‐hACE2 transgene mice, a model previously shown to survive infection. 129xB6‐K18‐hACE2 mice or littermate controls were infected with a low dose (5 × 102 PFU) of ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2. Complete viral clearance and full recovery from weight loss occurred by day 8 post‐infection. However, prolonged inflammation in the lung and airways persisted up to day 28 post‐infection and was associated with the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly CD8+ effector T cells. This model may therefore prove valuable for further understanding of drivers of long‐term lung inflammation and for testing therapeutic strategies and clinically relevant interventions that can target long‐term pulmonary inflammation following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has converged with the HIV epidemic. Although immunocompromised patients show an elevated risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to HIV infection, the impact remains contradictory. One reason could be the use of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Patients with HIV receiving ARV, such as tenofovir (TDF), have fewer symptoms of COVID-19. In mice, bleomycin (BLM) induces acute lung injury, resulting in an acute inflammatory response similar to the cytokine storm and lung damage observed in COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive role of TDF administration prior to BLM administration. A total of 64 eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, France), both male and female, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n = 8 per sex per group): (i) oral TDF administered in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) of saline on day 7 (TDF); (ii) oral TDF in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (TDF-BLM); (iii) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of saline on day 7 (SAL); and (iv) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (BLM). Animals were euthanized 72 h after OA (day 10), and serum and lung tissues were collected for analysis. TDF-BLM lungs showed significantly reduced bronchioalveolar lavage fluid total cell counts, specifically reduced macrophages and neutrophils counts, but an increased presence of minority lymphocytes. TDF downregulated BLM-induced levels of Il1β, Il6, TNFα, and Tgfβ mRNA. Preventive treatment with TDF counteracted BLM-induced alveolar and bronchiolar cell damage. Male mice showed more severe symptoms after BLM administration for most parameters, and the preventive action of TDF was similar in both sexes. Preventive TDF administration partially counteracted BLM-induced acute lung injury. These findings support epidemiological observations suggesting a potential benefit of TDF as a prophylactic therapy against COVID-19, at least in HIV-infected patients.">

Subsequently, the graft is re-infected early in the post-procedural phase, leading to viral persistence for more than five months. By analyzing viral evolution and effector immune response within the transplanted organ, we observe three main findings. First, virus evolution differs in the transplanted organ compared to that in the upper respiratory tract and is affected by monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and molnupiravir. Second, we show the potential clinical relevance of T cell HLA restriction that may facilitate viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract compared to the ongoing viral replication in the HLA mismatch organ. Third, close monitoring and modulation of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy enables viral clearance in a lung transplantation setting despite incomplete SARS-CoV-2 clearance prior to transplantation.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, spread rapidly across the globe in 2020, with most countries experiencing two distinct waves of infection. In Brazil, the second wave was marked by the emergence of the P.1 (Gamma) variant, which disproportionately affected younger individuals and was associated with increased mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile and post mortem histopathological lung findings, correlate them with laboratory results, and compare the first and second waves of COVID-19. To investigate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we performed immunohistochemistry for citrullinated histone H3 (cit-H3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Our cohort included patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a single center in southern Brazil. The study included 42 patients, 24 from the first wave and 18 from the second, who died between March 2020 and August 2021. Laboratory data included complete blood counts and D-dimer levels. Histopathological analyses were conducted using H&E-stained slides and reviewed independently by two blinded pathologists. MPO and cit-H3 immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate NETs markers. All cases exhibited varying degrees of inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), with frequent microvascular thrombi. Neutrophilic infiltration was significantly higher in the second wave. Additionally, cases with intense neutrophilic infiltration showed a stronger association with thrombosis. NETs were identified in 10 cases. No significant correlation was found between histopathological findings, NETs, and laboratory blood count results. The histopathological findings were consistent with those reported globally. The second wave of COVID-19 showed higher neutrophilic infiltrate in the lung tissue. Neutrophils play a key role in the inflammatory response and NET formation might indicate an increased risk of mortality. Further studies can consider NET-targeted therapies as potential strategies.">

        <tr id="Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of human Q fever, subverts macrophage antimicrobial functions to establish an intracellular replicative niche. To better understand the host-pathogen interactions, we investigated the transcriptional responses of human alveolar macrophages (hAMs) infected with virulent (NMI, G), attenuated (NMII), and avirulent (Dugway) strains of C. burnetii. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that all strains activated proinflammatory pathways, particularly IL-17 signaling, though the magnitude and nature of the response varied by strain. Dugway infection induced the most robust transcriptional response and consistent M1-like macrophage polarization, while responses to NMI and NMII were more variable. Cytokine assays confirmed significant secretion of effectors downstream of IL-17 signaling, but only at later stages of infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing further revealed heterogeneity in macrophage response to C. burnetii infection, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting divergent inflammatory profiles. These findings highlight the complexity of macrophage responses to C. burnetii and underscore the importance of strain-specific and cell-specific factors in shaping host immunity. Understanding these dynamics may inform the development of targeted therapies for Q fever.">

Growing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the development of gastrointestinal malignancies through several mechanisms, including sustained chronic inflammation, disruption of normal cellular homeostasis, and potential viral integration into host cells. These pathological processes have the potential to dysregulate critical cellular pathways, thereby promoting cancer development in vulnerable populations. A thorough understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the development of gastrointestinal cancer is essential for optimizing patient care and establishing comprehensive, long-term monitoring protocols.

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

        <tr id="Viral and bacterial lung infections place a significant burden on public health. Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican’s potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host’s immune response to lung infection. However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

However, current disease-modifying therapies demonstrate limited efficacy in addressing progressive disease subtypes, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we systematically review the neuroimmune interactions underlying the pathogenesis of MS, with a focus on three key aspects: the immune niche, immune cell types, and cell-based therapies. We first discuss the evolution of brain-immune concepts, from early notions of immune privilege to modern understandings of brain-border immune niches (meninges, choroid plexus, and perivascular spaces). These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes. Furthermore, we highlight emerging MS immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T regimens, mesenchymal stem cell interventions, microbiome modulation, and nanodelivery systems, which strategically target mechanistic nodes spanning neuroimmune niche regulation, inflammatory cascade blockade, and CNS neurorestorative capacities.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects humans and animals and is therefore a pathogen of grave concern within a One Health framework. Identifying animal-adaptive mutations is critical to preserving One Health, as these mutations could also lead to the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in animal reservoirs with continual spillover to humans. Therefore, we sought to pair experimental evolution and epidemiological data to identify putative human- and animal-adaptive viral residues and determine their impact on replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal cells. We passaged SARS-CoV-2 in cells expressing human, dog, cat, mink, and white-tailed deer ACE2 and sequenced the passaged populations. In addition, we searched SARS-CoV-2 sequences for mutations following patterns of convergent evolution that were common to both human- and animal-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We identified the epidemiologically relevant Spike A222V mutation from our passaging experiment in cells expressing cat ACE2, a mutation that has also arisen independently across eight lineages of SARS-CoV-2 from human- and animal-derived sequences. To assess its impact on replication in human and animal cells, we constructed SARS-CoV-2 Spike A222V in the Wuhan-Hu-1 backbone with Spike D614G; this virus replicated similarly to the WT SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 Spike A222V demonstrated an advantage in replication in primary deer lung cells, which was not mediated by the deer ACE2 receptor. Infection via the human, dog, cat, and mink ACE2 receptor resulted in reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 Spike A222V. Our experiments identified Spike A222V as a putatively deer-adaptive mutation. Future studies should assess Spike A222V’s relevance to transmission within deer and to other animal species in contact with deer.">

Although steroid therapies provide some clinical benefits, the underlying immunological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive immune profiling using multi-parametric flow cytometry on PBMCs from IESS (n=25) and LGS (n=9) patients, comparing them with age-matched healthy controls (n=54). Our findings identified distinct patterns of immune dysregulation: IESS patients exhibited reduced naïve CD4+ T cells, an altered CD4/CD8 ratio, and diminished TNFα production in CD4+ T cells. Conversely, LGS patients demonstrated an increase in central memory CD4+ T cells, marked dysfunction of Tregs, and heightened activation of CD8+ T cells. Notably, elevated activated CD8+ T cells in IESS patients correlated significantly with clinical severity and demonstrated enhanced responsiveness to viral peptides, suggesting prior viral infections may exacerbate disease progression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate distinct immune signatures associated with disease severity and progression in DEE, suggesting their potential utility as biomarkers. Further studies are necessary to determine whether targeting these immune pathways could provide clinical benefits.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel member of the Coronaviridae family. The viral genome encodes both structural proteins, such as spike, membrane, hemagglutinin, and envelope, as well as non-structural proteins that include auxiliary proteins and replicase essential for viral replication. While immunization campaigns have mitigated the spread of the virus, therapeutic interventions remain critical for managing outbreaks and preventing long-term health consequences. Despite extensive global research into the genome, structure, entry process, and replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, key aspects such as the roles of membrane lipids in viral entry, packaging, and release, as well as the metabolic alterations in infected cells, remain poorly understood. Epigenetics, the study of heritable phenotypic changes driven by genetic and non-genetic factors, plays a pivotal role in shaping host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation and acetylation, DNA and RNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation, significantly influence gene expression in infected host cells. These reversible changes orchestrate the host’s antiviral responses and potentially alter susceptibility to COVID-19. This review delves into the immuno-epigenetic modifications occurring in hosts infected with SARS-CoV-2, providing insights into how these changes trigger viral replication and infection processes. By examining the current state of research on the immune-epigenetic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we highlight the mechanisms by which these modifications affect the host-viral interplay. Furthermore, we propose potential therapeutic targets within the immune-epigenetic pathways that could enhance ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms will not only provide a deeper perspective on the virus’s pathogenic strategies but also offer innovative approaches to improve therapeutic interventions. By addressing the gaps in knowledge surrounding immune-epigenetic factors, this review aims to contribute to the development of novel strategies for preventing and managing coronavirus infections and its variants.">

        <tr id="Cell cultures are widely used to study infectious respiratory diseases and to test therapeutics; however, they do not faithfully recapitulate the architecture and complexity of the human respiratory tract. Lung organoids have emerged as an alternative model that partially overcomes this key disadvantage. Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection, and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses. Our study informs the selection of culture conditions for organoid-based respiratory disease research and therapeutic testing.


IMPORTANCE
The COVID-19 pandemic heralded the upsurge in human-derived lung organoid-based studies due to their cellular heterogeneity that partly emulates the cellular complexity of the respiratory tract. A major disadvantage of organoid models resides in their apical-in conformation that "hides" cells and proteins that are typically exposed to the air-liquid interface (ALI) in the airways and are targets of viruses. Here, we generated monolayers and ALI cultures to facilitate cell exposure to highly relevant pathogens and compared them to parental organoids. Organoids at the ALI captured infection and immune responses better than organoids and organoid-derived monolayer cultures. Organoids at the ALI are a viable approach to improve identification and characterization of virus infection, host responses, and therapeutic testing.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections. This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

Methods We investigated clinical and immunological responses after dual homologous mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2 and after booster vaccination or infection in 14 B‐cell depleted patients with inflammatory central nervous system disease in comparison to 28 healthy controls. Spike‐specific IgG were determined using ELISA and neutralizing activity by surrogate assay. Reactive T cells were flow‐cytometrically analyzed after spike‐specific and polyclonal stimulation. Reactogenicity was self‐reported using a questionnaire. Results Vaccination was well tolerated, with slightly more systemic events reported by patients. Spike‐specific antibodies were induced in all controls, but only 43% of patients with significantly lower IgG levels and reduced neutralizing capacity (p < 0.0001). In contrast, spike‐reactive T cells were induced in both groups with similar CD4 and higher CD8 T‐cell levels in patients. Functional characterization of spike‐reactive T cells revealed equally high CTLA‐4 expression in both groups, but higher proportions of polyfunctional, triple‐cytokine expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells in patients especially after the third immunization. Three patients experienced mild breakthrough infections after second vaccination. Conclusions Despite limited ability of B‐cell depleted patients to mount a humoral immune response after multiple doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 mRNA vaccination, the vaccine‐induced T‐cell response is robust, which may have implications for protection against severe disease.">

        <tr id="Progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) represents a distinct clinical and biological entity characterized by compartmentalized neuroinflammation, chronic glial activation, and resistance to conventional immunotherapies. Unlike relapsing MS, PMS is sustained by resident CNS immune networks, where activated microglia and astrocytes orchestrate persistent cytokine signaling—particularly involving TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6—through self-amplifying feedback loops. In this narrative review, we explore how these cytokines interact with oxidative stress, iron accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy to drive neurodegeneration. Human-based evidence is integrated with insights from experimental models to clarify translational mechanisms. We also highlight fluid biomarkers (e.g., GFAP, NfL) and imaging modalities (e.g., TSPO-PET, QSM) that reflect glial activity and disease progression in vivo. Age, sex hormones, and immunosenescence are discussed as modulators of cytokine expression. Finally, we review emerging therapeutic strategies that target glial metabolism and cytokine networks rather than peripheral immune cells, offering a systems-based framework for future PMS interventions and personalized disease monitoring.">

        <tr id="With the unprecedented surge of severe COVID-19 cases in early 2020, researchers and medical professionals worked actively to identify effective viral infection treatments based on a scientific understanding of viruses. Over the past few years, an enormous amount of research has investigated the viral infection and replication processes following the first SARS-CoV-2 case. With this knowledge, many drugs have been explicitly created to inhibit viral replication or decrease the severity of the immune response. Additionally, scientists have utilized decades of research and techniques to expedite SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA virus, belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgroup of Betacoronaviruses. Its emergence is not unique; previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS have shaped our understanding of coronavirus-related diseases. Molecular clock analysis suggests that the ancestor of all current coronaviruses existed over 10,000 years ago, with subsequent evolution occurring around 3300–2400 BC. Researchers have explored synthetic and natural treatments alongside other antiviral therapies, corticosteroids, and immunotherapies. Additionally, using artificial intelligence and nano-based technologies enriched SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and management. In this comprehensive review, we provide recent literature on COVID-19, exploring its evolving etiology, pathogenicity, and pathophysiology, alongside developments in synthetic and natural therapeutic strategies, vaccines, artificial intelligence in diagnosis, and nano-based technologies.">

We recently showed that HIV-1 promotes the ubiquitination of the amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), termed C99, to counteract its inhibitory effects on infection, but how and why C99 suppresses HIV-1 replication remains unclear. Here, we show that APP and Gag processing intersect and compete for two key components of the cellular sorting machinery, TSG101 and VPS4A. This in turn underlies the negative interplay between HIV-1 Gag and APP processing, whereby the need to replicate in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) increases amyloidogenic processing of APP and C99 in infected microglia.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review examines the role of heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) in COVID-19, highlighting its impact on immune modulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Hsp60, a chaperone protein essential for protein folding and protection against cell stress, has been linked to COVID-19 pathogenesis through its interactions with the immune system and potential involvement in post-infectious autoimmune processes. One of the key aspects discussed is the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, wherein Hsp60 exhibits epitope similarity with a number of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, a circumstance that may potentially culminate in the induction of autoimmune responses. This mimicry has the potential to contribute to the development of autoimmune conditions, including Guillain–Barré syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The document discusses Hsp60’s role in endothelial damage and thromboembolic complications, suggesting it could serve as a biomarker for disease severity and a therapeutic target. It raises concerns about vaccine safety due to Hsp60’s structural similarity to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which may trigger autoimmune responses. The potential for Hsp60 to generate anti-tumor immunity is explored, indicating that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 might also target tumor cells with similar epitopes. Further research is necessary to understand Hsp60’s role in disease fully and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It follows a dynamic course in which early hyperinflammation coexists and overlaps with progressive immune suppression, a process best described as immunodynamic disruption. Key mechanisms include extensive lymphocyte death, expansion of regulatory T cells, impaired antigen presentation, and persistent activation of inhibitory checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These changes reduce immune competence and increase vulnerability to secondary infections. Clinically, reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen–DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes and persistent lymphopenia have emerged as robust biomarkers for patient stratification and timing of immunomodulatory therapies. Beyond the acute phase, many survivors do not achieve full immune recovery but instead develop a Persistent Immune Remnant, defined as long-lasting immune, metabolic, and endothelial dysfunction despite apparent clinical resolution. Recognizing PIR emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring and biomarker-guided interventions to restore immune balance. To integrate these observations, we propose the SIMMP–Sepsis model (Sepsis-Associated Persistent Multiorgan Immunometabolic Syndrome), which links molecular dysfunction to clinical trajectories and provides a framework for developing precision immunotherapies. This perspective reframes sepsis not only as an acute crisis but also as a chronic immunometabolic syndrome, where survival marks the beginning of active immune restoration.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immune dysfunction, but how disease-intrinsic mechanisms in treatment-naive patients influence the coordination of adaptive responses to novel antigens remains unclear. Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell immunity in 38 treatment-naive CLL patients and 13 healthy controls (HCs) following vaccination. Despite significantly reduced total immunoglobulin levels compared to HCs, 94.7% of CLL patients developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, and 89.5% mounted IgA responses, with serum titers comparable to those of HCs. Virus-specific T cell responses, measured by IFN-γ release following antigen stimulation, were detected in 78.9% of patients. CLL patients had significantly more circulating CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells than HCs. These expansions correlated with B cell abundance, which, in untreated CLL, predominantly reflects malignant B cells. Notably, Tfh cell frequencies and absolute counts were highest in patients lacking a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, indicating a decoupling between Tfh expansion and functional antiviral immunity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that while SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are largely preserved in treatment-naive CLL patients, disease-driven alterations in T cell composition may compromise the coordination and quality of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a prominent pathogen that impacts swine and presents a zoonotic threat to humans; it is a cause of bacterial meningitis, a severe condition linked to neurological impairment and elevated mortality rates. For SS2 to access the central nervous system, it must traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB); however, the precise mechanisms underlying this process remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that the RTX family exoprotein A (RfeA), which is secreted by SS2, can be internalized by human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) via a caveolae/lipid raft-dependent pathway. RfeA subsequently induces pyroptosis through the NLRP3/Caspase-1 pathway, a process attributed to the increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). The interaction between the N-terminus of RfeA and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) leads to mtROS production, which can be suppressed by a VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor. RfeA-induced pyroptosis results in disruption of the BBB in both the hBMEC monolayer model and the mouse infection model, thereby promoting bacterial infection of the brain. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which SS2 induces pyroptosis to breach the BBB, suggesting a potential target for the prevention and treatment of SS2 infection.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which play a vital role in triggering innate immune responses such as the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs). While modest PRR activation helps to defend against SARS-CoV-2, excessive or sustained activation can cause harmful inflammation and contribute to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Altered expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are among the most important members of the PRR family members, particularly TLRs 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9, has been strongly linked to COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), collectively known as RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors), act as sensors that detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The expression of these receptors, as well as that of different DNA sensors, varies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Changes in PRR expression, particularly that of TLRs, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), have also been shown to play a role in the development and persistence of long COVID (LC). However, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved strategies to evade PRR recognition and subsequent signaling pathway activation, contributing to the IFN response dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Nevertheless, PRR agonists and antagonists remain promising therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to describe the PRRs involved in recognizing SARS-CoV-2, explore their expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and examine their role in determining the severity of both COVID-19 and long-term manifestations of the disease. It also describes the strategies developed by SARS-CoV-2 to evade PRR recognition and activation. Moreover, given the considerable interest in modulating PRR activity as a novel immunotherapy approach, this review will provide a description of PRR agonists and antagonists that have been investigated as antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to explore the complex interplay between PRRs and SARS-CoV-2 in depth, considering its implications for prognostic biomarkers, targeted therapeutic strategies and the mechanistic understanding of long LC. Additionally, it outlines future perspectives that could help to address knowledge gaps in PRR-mediated responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in long-term multiorgan complications, with the kidney being a primary target. This study aimed to characterize the long-term transcriptomic changes in the kidney following coronavirus infection using a murine model of MHV-1-induced SARS-like illness and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SPIKENET (SPK). Methods: A/J mice were infected with MHV-1. Renal tissues were collected and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis and Next Generation RNA Sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes associated with acute and chronic infection. Bioinformatic analyses, including PCA, volcano plots, and GO/KEGG pathway enrichment, were performed. A separate cohort received SPK treatment, and comparative transcriptomic profiling was conducted. Gene expression profile was further confirmed using real-time PCR. Results: Acute infection showed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Long-term MHV-1 infection led to the sustained upregulation of genes involved in muscle regeneration, cytoskeletal remodeling, and fibrotic responses. Notably, both expression and variability of SLC22 and SLC22A8, key proximal tubule transporters, were reduced, suggesting a loss of segment-specific identity. Further, SLC12A1, a critical regulator of sodium reabsorption and blood pressure, was downregulated and is associated with the onset of polyuria and hydronephrosis. SLC transporters exhibited expression patterns consistent with tubular dysfunction and inflammation. These findings suggest aberrant activation of myogenic pathways and structural proteins in renal tissues, consistent with a pro-fibrotic phenotype. In contrast, SPK treatment reversed the expression of most genes, thereby restoring the gene profiles to those observed in control mice. Conclusions: MHV-1-induced long COVID is associated with persistent transcriptional reprogramming in the kidney, indicative of chronic inflammation, cytoskeletal dysregulation, and fibrogenesis. SPK demonstrates robust therapeutic potential by normalizing these molecular signatures and preventing long-term renal damage. These findings underscore the relevance of the MHV-1 model and support further investigation of SPK as a candidate therapy for COVID-19-associated renal sequelae.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection was responsible for the pandemic COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) and caused a range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal disorders and abdominal pain, making COVID-19 a multi-organ dysfunction. It is known that the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed also in the gut, where SARS-CoV-2 could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, similarly to what has been widely described in the lung1. This case report concerns a middle-aged man admitted to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy) and tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from the infection. Due to thrombotic and hemorragic gut conditions, accompanied by severe ulceration, the patient underwent resection of a segment of ileum. Immunohistochemical analyses showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared to the non-ulcerated one2. Moreover, expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin (FN) were analyzed. VEGF expression was increased in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared with control and non-ulcerated ileum. FN staining was progressively increasing in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. By electron microscopy the microvilli alteration of brush border and of intercellular junctions were detected in the ulcerated area but not in other areas of patient’s ileum or in the control sample. The salient aspect of this study is that although the patient was declared negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the respiratory level, SPIKE and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins were still present in the ileum, concentrated in the ulcerated area and parallelled by an increased expression of vascular markers. The ultrastructural analysis gave insights on the morpho-functional effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection on the gut epithelium, indicating that the damage is not limited to vascular structures.">

        <tr id="Background: There is growing evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to metabolic dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysregulation, all of which may impair liver function and promote glucose intolerance. This study investigated the role of SARS-CoV-2, specifically its Main Protease (Mpro), in accelerating insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction in HepG2 cells in vitro. Methods: HepG2 cells were treated with varying concentrations of Mpro (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 nmol/mL) for 24 h to assess cytotoxicity and glucose uptake. Based on initial findings, subsequent assays focused on higher concentrations (40, 80, and 160 nmol/mL). The effects of Mpro on cell viability, protein kinase B (AKT) expression, matrix metallopeptidase-1 (MMP1), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and lipid peroxidation were investigated. Results: Our findings reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro treatment led to a concentration-dependent reduction in glucose uptake in HepG2 cells. Additionally, the Mpro treatment was associated with reduced insulin-stimulated AKT activation, particularly at higher concentrations. Inflammatory markers such as IL-6 were elevated in the extracellular medium, while DPP4 expression was decreased. However, extracellular soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) levels did not show a significant change. Despite these changes, cell viability remained relatively unaffected, suggesting that the HepG2 cells were able to maintain overall metabolic functions under Mpro exposure. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the concentration-dependent impairment of hepatic glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammatory pathways in HepG2 cells acutely exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. These findings warrant further investigation to explore the long-term metabolic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its proteases in the liver and to develop potential therapeutic approaches for post-viral metabolic complications.">

        <tr id="The interleukin-2 receptor γ (IL-2Rγ, or γc) is a crucial component of several cytokine receptor complexes. Deficiencies in γc lead to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), characterized by recurrent infections due to the absence or dysfunction of T and NK cells, and nonfunctional B cells. Missense variants in the γc extracellular region are linked to atypical X-SCID with normal counts of T, B, and NK cells and less severe symptoms, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. This study describes a case of atypical X-SCID with a missense variant (c.420 A > T, p.R140S) in the γc extracellular domain, associated with recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. We found that the R140S variant leads to reduced surface expression and variably affects cytokine receptor signaling. Specifically, STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells are impaired in response to IL-7, a cytokine essential for T cell survival, proliferation and function. Notably, γcR140S predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to WT γc, which is found in acidic compartments. Despite this mislocalization, γcR140S does not trigger unfolded protein responses, and its protein stability and degradation pathways remain unaffected. Nevertheless, cells expressing high levels of γcR140S exhibited a competitive disadvantage in culture compared to those expressing WT γc, resulting in the enrichment of cells expressing lower levels of γcR140S. These findings extend our understanding of how mutations in the extracellular domain of γc can lead to reduced protein expression and influence the pathophysiology of atypical X-SCID.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Cytokine storm can result from uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokines released in SARS-CoV-2 infection that cause damage to several organs. Il-6 is one of the major mediators of cytokine storm. IFN-α2 has been reported to have anti-viral potential and the pre-infection levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been suggested to drive the fate of the disease. There is a paucity of information on how anti-viral cytokines at the onset of infection affect the disease progression. This study aims to profile IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 expression levels for 44 days post-diagnosis and their effects on recovery.


METHODS
Peripheral venous blood was collected from 38 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants who came for diagnosis at the Center for Research on Emerging and Reemerging Diseases. IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-α2 levels were measured using a Luminex panel.


RESULTS
Males had higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load than females, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Age-related variation was also observed, with individuals aged 40-60 showing significantly higher viral load than those over 60 (p=0.045). Cytokines analysis revealed that males had significantly higher levels of IFNα-2, IL-2, and IL-6 (p=0.0031, p=0.009, and p=0.022 respectively) than females upon diagnosis, with cytokines levels decreasing over time in males but increasing in females. Cytokine levels trended higher in symptomatic individuals, although differences were not significant.


CONCLUSION
These findings highlight the influence of sex, clinical status, and viral load on cytokine dynamics in COVID-19, with potential implications for understanding disease severity and immune response.">

        <tr id="Background: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been pivotal in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, understanding vaccine-induced immunity in immunocompromised individuals remains critical, particularly how prior exposure to other coronaviruses modulates immune responses. The influence of previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as OC43, on SARS-CoV-2 immunity is not fully understood. This study evaluates antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccination in hemodialysis patients (HD), transplant recipients (TR), and healthy controls (CO), accounting for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and baseline human coronavirus (HCoV) reactivity. Methods: We obtained longitudinal antibody measurements from 70 subjects (CO: n = 33; HD: n = 13; TR: n = 24) and assessed antibody kinetics across multiple post-vaccination time points using multivariate linear mixed modeling (MLMM). Results: Limited but measurable cross-reactivity was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs, particularly the β-coronavirus OC43. Pre-existing immunity in healthy individuals modestly enhanced vaccine-induced anti-spike (S) IgG responses, supported by post-vaccination increases in SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly influenced anti-S and nucleocapsid (N) IgG responses but had limited impact on endemic HCoVs responses. Vaccine type and immune status significantly affected antibody kinetics. mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2) elicited stronger and more durable SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG responses than the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine, especially in immunocompetent individuals. Immunocompromised groups showed delayed or attenuated responses, with modest anti-S IgG cross-reactive boosting. Elevated anti-N IgG in CoronaVac recipients raised questions about its origin—infection or vaccine effects. MLMM identified key immunological and clinical predictors of antibody responses, emphasizing the critical role of host immune history. Conclusions: These findings highlight a constrained but meaningful role for HCoV cross-reactivity in SARS-CoV-2 immunity and vaccine responsiveness, underscore the need for infection markers unaffected by vaccination, and support development of broadly protective pan-coronavirus vaccines and tailored strategies for at-risk populations.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-24 (IL-24) is a cytokine known for its role in immune regulation and apoptosis, with potential implications in viral infections like COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the association between IL-24 serum levels and the severity of COVID-19 disease. In this prospective bi-center cross-sectional study, we enrolled 41 COVID-19 patients from two hospitals in Germany. Serial blood samples were collected from a subset of patients, resulting in 88 total blood samples. Patients were categorized into critical, severe, moderate, and mild disease groups based on WHO criteria. IL-24 serum levels were measured during the acute or convalescent phase using an ELISA assay. Inflammatory markers, and kidney and liver function parameters were also evaluated. Statistical analysis included non-parametric tests and correlation analysis. Elevated IL-24 serum levels were observed in ambulant patients (mild disease), compared to hospitalized patients (critical, severe, moderate disease, p < 0.05). IL-24 levels were also significantly higher in patients without oxygenation disorder compared to those with oxygenation therapy (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between IL-24 levels and markers of inflammation and liver/kidney function. Elevated IL-24 serum levels were associated with milder COVID-19 courses, suggesting a protective role in modulating immune responses and promoting antiviral apoptosis. Conversely, reduced IL-24 in severe cases may reflect impaired immune regulation, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), marked by persistent symptoms lasting weeks to months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, affects multiple organ systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and renal systems. These prolonged effects stem from chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and direct viral injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)—small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation—play a pivotal role in this process by modulating immune responses, inflammation, and cellular stress. Altered miRNA expression patterns during and after infection contribute to the pathogenesis of Long COVID. While conventional miRNA detection techniques have been valuable, they face limitations in sensitivity, throughput, and detecting RNA modifications. This review highlights Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS) as a promising alternative, offering real-time, long-read, amplification-free RNA sequencing that preserves native modifications. ONS enables direct sequencing of full-length miRNAs and their precursors, providing novel insights into miRNA processing and regulatory roles. Despite current challenges with short-read accuracy, ongoing technical advances are improving ONS performance. Its integration in miRNA profiling holds significant potential for uncovering novel regulatory interactions and advancing clinical biomarker discovery in Long COVID and other conditions.">

        <tr id="Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) directly contribute to local inflammation in type 2 inflammatory airway diseases. Here, we identify ILC2 subsets by single cell RNA sequencing in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and in a memory inflammatory mouse model. We find that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)+ILC2s, with similar markers to their human counterparts, expresse memory cell markers, persist over time, and respond more vigorously to a secondary unrelated antigen challenge in the mouse model. Genetic ablation of TLR4 or blockade by anti-TLR4 antibodies leads to the reduction of IL-13 expression from ILC2s and mucus production in mice. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing further confirms the importance of accessible TLR4 gene loci and its down-stream signaling pathway in maintaining trained immunity of TLR4+ILC2s after repeated stimulation by HDM. Taken together, TLR4 has a function in trained immunity maintenance within ILC2s, which may contribute to disease chronicity through a non-specific immunological memory.">

        <tr id="Fever, a universal host defense in infection and inflammation, paradoxically contributes to neurological complications in malaria. While febrile temperatures enhance the expression of parasite virulence proteins that mediate vascular adhesion and disease severity, its effects in the endothelium remain elusive. Here we present a 3D fever-on-a-chip model that recapitulates human brain and lung microvessels under febrile conditions. Short febrile episodes at 40 °C, common in treated cerebral malaria patients, rapidly enhanced iRBC and immune cell binding under flow. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that this phenotype was driven by endothelial glycocalyx shedding, which exposed endothelial receptors EPCR and ICAM-1. Preserving glycocalyx integrity with a broad MMP inhibitor prevented the temperature-induced rise in cytoadhesion. These findings identify fever as a host-specific amplifier of vascular pathology in malaria and highlight endothelial-protective or antipyretic interventions as important strategies to mitigate febrile microvascular pathology.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

        <tr id="Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a life-threatening heterogeneous condition characterized by inflammation of the colon. Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) is essential for antigen processing and immune regulation, however, its specific role in UC pathogenesis and therapeutic response remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of ERAP1 in the response to sulfasalazine, a standard treatment for UC, using an ERAP1-heterozygous (ERAP1+/-) mouse model susceptible to colitis. Methods Wild-type (WT) and ERAP1+/- mice were treated with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium to induce colitis, followed by sulfasalazine administration. Colitis severity was assessed through histopathology. Immune cell populations, including neutrophils, dendritic cells, T cells, and NK1.1+ cells, were analyzed using flow cytometry. RNA sequencing of colonic tissues was performed to assess gene expression changes associated with reduced ERAP1 expression. Results ERAP1+/- mice exhibited mildly increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis, with greater weight loss and distinct alterations in immune cell infiltration compared to WT mice. These differences were further pronounced after sulfasalazine treatment. RNA sequencing identified 428 differentially expressed genes between ERAP1⁺/⁻ and WT mice. Among these, 28 genes were previously associated with colitis or colorectal cancer, of which 11 were upregulated and 17 downregulated in ERAP1+/- mice. RT-qPCR confirmed significantly elevated expression of Anxa9, Atp2a1, and Hepacam2 in ERAP1+/- mice after sulfasalazine treatment, indicating a differential therapeutic response. Conclusion Collectively, our findings show that partial ERAP1 deficiency promotes immune dysregulation, alters the expression of inflammation-associated genes, and impairs sulfasalazine efficacy. Therefore, ERAP1 may serve as a key regulator in the pathogenesis of UC and a potential target for therapy.">

        <tr id="Cytokine storm (CS) is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Hypoxic signaling has been proposed to influence proinflammatory pathways and to be involved in the development of CS. Here, for the first time, the role of hypoxia in coronavirus-mediated inflammation has been investigated, using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Analysis of the transcriptome of A549 lung epithelial cells using RNA sequencing revealed 191 mRNAs which were synergistically upregulated and 43 mRNAs which were synergistically downregulated by the combination of human Betacoronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection and hypoxia. Synergistically upregulated mRNAs were strongly associated with inflammatory pathway activation. Analysis of the expression of 105 cytokines and immune-related proteins using antibody arrays identified five proteins (IGFBP-3, VEGF, CCL20, CD30, and myeloperoxidase) which were markedly upregulated in HCoV-OC43 infection in hypoxia compared to HCoV-OC43 infection in normal oxygen conditions. Our findings show that COVID-19 patients with lung hypoxia may face increased risk of inflammatory complications. Two of the proteins we have identified as synergistically upregulated, the cytokines VEGF and CCL20, represent potential future therapeutic targets. These could be targeted directly or, based on the novel findings described here by inhibiting hypoxia signaling pathways, to reduce excessive inflammatory cytokine responses in patients with severe infections.">

        <tr id="Monitoring the presence and distribution of distinct immune cell populations is key in deciphering immunopathologic disease mechanisms. Considering the crucial role of myeloid cells in provoking hyperinflammatory responses associated with coronavirus disease 2019, a camelid-derived single-domain antibody specifically recognizing human signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) as a biomarker for myeloid cells has been generated and radiolabeled with 64Cu, that is, [64Cu]copper-SIRPα-nanobody ([64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb), for in vivo PET imaging. In this study, this PET tracer was used and validated to monitor the temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nonhuman primates. For further validation, the signal of [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb was compared with the signal of TSPO-targeting [18F]fluorine-N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ([18F]F-DPA714). Methods: Six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently monitored for 7 wk. We performed a baseline [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT before infection, followed by repetitive PET/CT on days 3, 10, 24, and 52 after infection covering the head, thorax, and abdominal region. Of the 6 macaques, 3 underwent additional TSPO-targeting [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT investigations at baseline and at days 2, 9, 23, and 51 after infection. Tracheal and nasal swabs were taken to monitor the course of infection, and changes in blood count and inflammatory mediators in the periphery blood were monitored. Results: Detection of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA from tracheal and nasal swab samples confirmed viral infection of all animals. CT scans identified initial pulmonary lesions 2 days after infection. [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT revealed increased tracer uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes of all animals, but not in the lung lesions, 3 days after infection. [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT showed increased uptake in both anatomically affected and unaffected lung tissues. The increased [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake in the spleen and bone marrow of all animals was more pronounced 3 and 7 wk after infection. We detected individual differences in [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake within the bone marrow and spleen, whereas [18F]F-DPA714 exhibited rather homogeneous uptake patterns. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb is a versatile tool for quantitative monitoring of whole-body distribution, temporal distribution, and accumulation dynamics of myeloid cell subpopulations even in moderately inflamed tissues and affected lymphatic organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="RATIONALE
Bacterial pneumonia poses a substantial global health burden, yet the immunological mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis and resolution are incompletely understood.


METHODS
We generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood immune cells from 100 individuals: 39 with severe bacterial pneumonia, 31 with mild disease, and 30 healthy controls. Integrating scRNA-seq with clinical and molecular data revealed profound remodeling of the peripheral immune landscape across disease severities.


MAIN RESULTS
Severe pneumonia was characterized by lymphopenia and monocytosis, accompanied by distinct shifts in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subset composition. Classical monocytes emerged as central orchestrators of the cytokine storm observed in severe cases, displaying elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., S100A8/9/12) and enhanced TLR4-MYD88 signaling. Exhaustion of innate-like CD8+ T cells, marked by upregulation of canonical inhibitory receptors, was a hallmark of severe disease. In contrast, mild pneumonia exhibited robust CD8+ T effector and helper memory cell activation, along with effective humoral immunity, evidenced by plasma cell expansion and coordinated Tfh-B cell interactions. B cells in mild cases showed enhanced antigen recognition, BCR signaling, and co-stimulatory gene expression, whereas those in severe cases displayed signs of dysfunction. Myeloid cell alterations in severe pneumonia included increased monocytic MDSCs and non-classical monocytes, contributing to immunosuppression and complement overactivation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This high-resolution atlas of peripheral immune responses in bacterial pneumonia identifies key cellular and molecular drivers of disease severity, providing potential therapeutic targets for immunomodulation and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections globally, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. While recent advances in prophylaxis, such as long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization, offer promise for prevention, therapeutic options for active infection remain limited. Severe RSV disease is often driven not solely by viral replication but by dysregulated host immune responses, including excessive cytokine production, T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) cell polarization, and impaired interferon signaling. RSV has evolved sophisticated immune evasion strategies, such as inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) via nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2), and interference with pattern recognition receptor signaling, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. These mechanisms result in attenuated innate immune responses and defective adaptive immunity, contributing to viral persistence, immunopathology, and recurrent infections. Moreover, age-dependent vulnerabilities, such as immune immaturity in infants and immunosenescence in older adults, exacerbate disease severity. Excessive immune activation leads to bronchiolitis, airway remodeling, and long-term sequelae including wheezing and asthma. Emerging immunomodulatory therapies aim to restore immune balance, targeting cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, or inflammasome activity. Host-directed therapies and direct-acting antivirals are also under investigation. A better understanding of RSV–host immune interactions is critical for optimizing therapeutic strategies and designing effective vaccines. This review synthesizes current knowledge on RSV immunopathogenesis and highlights immunomodulation as a promising frontier for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="COVID affects around 400 million individuals today with a strong economic impact on the global economy. The list of long COVID symptoms is extremely broad because it is derived from neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, and renal dysfunctions and damages. We review here these pathophysiological manifestations and the predictors of this multi-organ pathology like the persistence of the virus, altered endothelial function, unrepaired tissue damage, immune dysregulation, and gut dysbiosis. We also discuss the similarities between long COVID and vaccine side effects together with possible common immuno-inflammatory pathways. Since the spike protein is present in SARS-CoV-2 (and its variants) but also produced by the COVID vaccines, its toxicity may also apply to all mRNA or adenoviral DNA vaccines as they are based on the production of a very similar spike protein to the virus. After COVID infection or vaccination, the spike protein can last for months in the body and may interact with ACE2 receptors and mannan-binding lectin (MBL)/mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP-2), which are present almost everywhere in the organism. As a result, the spike protein may be able to trigger inflammation in a lot of organs and systems similar to COVID infection. We suggest that three immuno-inflammatory pathways are particularly key and responsible for long COVID and COVID vaccine side effects, as it has been shown for COVID, which may explain in large part their strong similarities: the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the kininogen–kinin–kallikrein system (KKS), and the lectin complement pathway. We propose that therapeutic studies should focus on these pathways to propose better cures for both long COVID as well as for COVID vaccine side effects.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), are markedly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis (ICI-M). Endomyocardial biopsies from these patients also show GBP-associated inflammasome overexpression. While both factors are implicated in ICI-M pathophysiology, their interplay and cellular targets remain poorly characterized. Our aim was to elucidate how ICI-M-associated cytokines affect the viability and inflammatory responses of endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models. ECs and CMs were differentiated from the same hiPSC line derived from a healthy donor. Cells were exposed either to IFN-γ alone or to an inflammatory cytokine cocktail (CCL5, GZMB, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α). We assessed large-scale transcriptomic changes via microarray and evaluated inflammatory, apoptotic, and cell death pathways at cellular and molecular levels. hiPSC-ECs were highly sensitive to cytokine exposure, displaying significant mortality and marked transcriptomic changes in immunity- and inflammation-related pathways. In contrast, hiPSC-CM showed limited transcriptional changes and reduced susceptibility to cytokine-induced death. In both cell types, cytokine treatment upregulated key components of the inflammasome pathway, including regulators (GBP5, GBP6, P2X7, NLRC5), a core component (AIM2), and the effector GSDMD. Increased GBP5 expression and CASP-1 cleavage mirrored the findings found elsewhere in endomyocardial biopsies from ICI-M patients. This hiPSC-based model reveals a distinct cellular sensitivity to ICI-M-related inflammation, with endothelial cells showing heightened vulnerability. These results reposition endothelial dysfunction, rather than cardiomyocyte injury alone, as a central mechanism in ICI-induced myocarditis. Modulating endothelial inflammasome activation, particularly via AIM2 inhibition, could offer a novel strategy to mitigate cardiac toxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy.">

        <tr id="BackgroundMicroglia are central mediators of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing significantly to disease pathogenesis. Understanding microglial heterogeneity and their regulatory mechanisms is critical for identifying potential therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the diversity of microglial subpopulations in AD and uncover key transcriptional regulators driving their pathogenic activity.MethodsWe integrated bulk RNA sequencing data from AD patients and 5×FAD mouse models with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile microglial heterogeneity. Differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, pseudotime trajectory, and SCENIC analyses were used to identify functionally distinct subsets and regulatory networks. Experimental validation was conducted through in vivo assays in 5×FAD mice and in vitro inhibition studies targeting HIF-1α.ResultsA unique microglial subpopulation, termed microglia_2, was identified with an inflammatory-angiogenic transcriptional signature that was enriched during AD progression. This subset showed significant activation of inflammatory pathways. Pseudotime and SCENIC analyses revealed HIF-1α as a master regulator of microglia_2. In 5×FAD mice, cognitive decline was accompanied by increased expression of HIF-1α and Apoe, as well as microglial activation in the prefrontal cortex. In vitro inhibition of HIF-1α significantly reduced microglial inflammation.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that a specific microglial subpopulation characterized by elevated HIF-1α expression may contribute to AD-associated neuroinflammation. By integrating transcriptomic analyses and experimental validation, we provide cell type-specific insights into disease mechanisms, offering potential insights for future mechanistic studies and therapeutic exploration.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Tens of thousands of severe COVID-19 cases are hospitalized weekly in the U.S., often driven by an imbalance between antiviral responses and inflammatory signaling, leading to uncontrolled cytokine secretion. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is a known immune antagonist, but its role in macrophage-driven cytokine storms is unclear. We demonstrate that N functions in a pathway-specific manner, specifically amplifying nuclear factor κB-related transcripts upon Toll-like receptor 7/8 stimulation. Moreover, we show that this is a conserved feature of pathogenic coronaviruses, with the delta variant N being the most pro-inflammatory. Our interaction networks suggest the delta variant N drives inflammation through interactions with several stress granule-related proteins. Profiling of secreted cytokines revealed that supernatants from the delta variant N-expressing macrophages disrupt brain and heart endothelial barriers, implicating N in COVID-19-associated cognitive and cardiac complications. Our findings highlight N-mediated immune imbalance as a driver of severe COVID-19 and identify N as a promising therapeutic target to mitigate hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p < 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software. Results Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="Background: This study aimed to analyze metabolic changes in blood samples from patients with confirmed COVID-19 to explore the correlation between metabolomics and cytokines in survivors and non-survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the complex biochemical and immunometabolic mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for elucidating the pathophysiology and virulence of COVID-19. Methods: This study included 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 40 healthy controls. Serum metabolic profiles were analyzed using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), and cytokine levels were measured using ELISA. Results: Our study defined three clear metabolic phenotypes among survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 compared with healthy controls, which might be related to mortality, severity, and disease burden. A strong relationship was observed between certain inflammatory markers, including IL-1β, IL-2, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-17, and GM-CSF, as well as several metabolites, particularly in COVID-19 non-survivors, such as LysoPCs, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and serotonin. Different metabolite-cytokine correlation patterns were observed according to patient outcomes, indicating unique correlations between metabolic and immune responses in survivors and non-survivors. Metabolic phenotypes were associated with clinical outcomes, comorbidities, and sex-related differences. Kynurenine and related metabolites of tryptophan metabolism were closely correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and mortality. Compared with survivors and healthy controls, non-survivors displayed higher IL-6, together with distinct metabolic changes. These included increased kynurenine through the IDO1 pathway, elevated glucose and lactate reflecting hyperglycolysis and energy stress, and higher xanthosine from purine turnover. Stronger cytokine–metabolite correlations in this group point to tightly linked immunometabolic activation. Conclusions: Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct metabolic phenotypes that could be associated with the severity and inflammation levels of COVID-19. Correlation analysis between metabolites and cytokines demonstrated strong intercorrelations between specific metabolites and cytokines, indicating a strong interrelationship between inflammatory markers and metabolic alterations. Specific metabolic pathways associated with cytokines and their clinical relevance may serve as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has triggered a global health crisis, with over 700 million confirmed cases and at least 7 million deaths reported by early 2024. Children are less vulnerable to severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection than adults and typically experience milder respiratory symptoms. However, a rare but significant complication, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS‐C), can develop weeks after infection, characterized by a spectrum of inflammatory symptoms. This study employed whole‐exome sequencing and over‐representation analysis to identify genetic variants of potential clinical significance related to MIS‐C or severe COVID‐19 in a group of children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), all of whom were unvaccinated for COVID‐19. We observed the enrichment of potentially pathogenic genetic variants in genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, particularly glycogen breakdown, in severe COVID‐19 pediatric patients, and in genes related to cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in MIS‐C patients. These findings offer insights into the genetic underpinnings of MIS‐C and severe COVID‐19, suggesting potential genes and biological pathways for further research.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frequently induces olfactory dysfunction (OD), a symptom that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Understanding the variability in OD and nasal tissue pathology across different SARS-CoV-2 variants may provide insights as to the mechanisms underlying this symptom and inform therapeutic strategies for COVID-19-related sequelae. This study examines the OD and associated nasal pathology in Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Wuhan (WA-1), Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, at 5 days post-infection. Olfactory function was assessed using buried food detection tests. Hamsters infected with the WA-1, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants exhibited prolonged discovery times as compared to controls, indicating severe OD. In contrast, those infected with the Delta and Omicron variants showed minimal or mild delays. Pathological examination of the lateral turbinate (LT) revealed severe olfactory epithelial damage in WA-1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variant infections, while the Omicron variant caused minimal damage. Viral antigens were detected in retained and/or sloughed epithelial cells in the LT across all variant infections. These results demonstrate significant differences in OD severity and nasal tissue damage among SARS-CoV-2 variants, providing critical insights for understanding the pathogenesis of this symptom and guiding treatment development for COVID-19 sequelae.IMPORTANCEOlfactory dysfunction (OD) is a prominent and distinctive symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that significantly affects patients' quality of life.

Hamsters infected with the WA-1, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants experienced significant OD, while those infected with Delta and Omicron showed milder symptoms. Severe epithelial damage in the nasal turbinate was observed in hamsters infected with WA-1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants, whereas Omicron variant infection resulted in minimal tissue injury. Despite the variability in OD and tissue damage, viral antigen was detected in all infected hamsters. These findings underscore the diverse impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on olfactory function and nasal tissue pathology, providing important insights into the pathogenesis of OD and guiding potential therapeutic strategies for coronavirus disease 2019-related olfactory sequelae.">

        <tr id="In response to an infection, the host T cell compartment develops immunological memory to ensure rapid responses upon re-infection with the same pathogen. However, these memory responses can also modulate immune reactions to unrelated pathogens through bystander activation. Herein, T cells are activated in an antigen-independent manner, often triggered by innate cytokines or Toll-like receptor ligands. To uncover new strategies for modulating immune responses, it is essential to deepen our understanding of this alternative mechanism of T cell activation, particularly in humans. Therefore, we studied the response of human CD8+ T cells to innate bystander stimuli in vitro. Thereby, we measured the induction of activation markers and proliferation using flow cytometry, and depleted or blocked several potential modulatory components to identify mediators of bystander CD8+ T-cell responses. Our study demonstrates that CD8+ T cells can be activated as bystander cells in response to innate stimuli present during a viral infection, including IL-15, IFN-α, and TLR7/8 and 9 agonists (R848 and CpG). Depletion experiments demonstrated that these bystander responses are dependent on monocytes and CD4+ T cells. In addition, we revealed that the bystander responses to the innate stimuli are highly reliant on IL-2 signaling. Altogether, our study underscores the pivotal role of IL-2 in mediating bystander responses of CD8+ T cells to innate stimuli, revealing a novel mechanism of immune response modulation during viral infections.">

        <tr id="Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus primarily associated with central nervous system disorders. Recent studies have indicated that JEV infection can lead to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the tropism of different genotypes of JEV strains for peripheral nerves and their potential impact on peripheral nerves. Four JEV strains—GI NX1889, GI GZ56, GIII P3, and GV XZ0934—representing three prevalent genotypes in China were selected for analysis. Compared with other JEV strains, NX1889 exhibited greater peripheral nerve tropism, leading to peripheral nerve dysfunction, severe pathological changes, and inflammatory responses. Further investigation revealed that Schwann cells (SCs) supported productive replication of GI JEV, but not GIII or GV strains. Although both GI strains infected SCs and caused proliferation inhibition and G1 phase arrest, only NX1889 induced apoptosis. At the symptomatic peak, NX1889-infected mice demonstrated significantly higher viral loads in sciatic nerves and dorsal root ganglia compared to peripheral non-neural tissues and organs. Sciatic nerves exhibited extensive infiltration of CD45 + inflammatory cells and upregulated pro-inflammatory mediators, and the viral load and CCL2 expression in sciatic nerves were positively correlated with limb motor deficits. These findings demonstrate that JEV strains exhibit distinct abilities to induce peripheral nerve injury (PNI), with the variation being a strain-specific characteristic of NX1889 rather than a genotype-specific feature of GI. The peripheral nerve is a vital site for JEV NX1889 replication, and the direct viral invasion of SCs leads to demyelinating neuropathy, with subsequent immune-inflammatory responses exacerbating this injury. This study broadens the spectrum of pathogens known to directly invade and damage peripheral nerves and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of JEV-associated PNI.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to far-reaching consequences. The changes caused in COVID-19 patients may persist for more than 6-12 months after acute phase of the disease promoting post-COVID disorders of immune system. Patients who have had acute COVID-19 in both mild and severe forms suffer from various manifestations of post-COVID syndrome. However, the severity of these manifestations is quite variable. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of lung damage extent in acute period of COVID-19 on the severity of clinical manifestations in post-COVID syndrome as exemplified by immune-mediated syndromes, i.e., autoimmune disorders, proliferative conditions, and allergopathology. 131 patients who had who had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were examined. Anamnestic data from outpatient cards of patients were used for the study. Using the ELISA diagnostics method, IgA, IgM, IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2, complement components C1q, C3a, C5a were determined. The studies revealed a connection between the severity of post-COVID syndrome and the severity of the acute COVID-19 course. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is able of activating complement, and this activation persists for a long time (more than six months). This finding explains presence of clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in individuals who have had a mild acute form of COVID-19 without CT-detected lung damage without phenotypes of immune system damage that we have previously identified (congenital – decreased expression of CD46 on T lymphocytes and decreased expression of CD46 on NK cells, and acquired – decreased level of T-cytotoxic lymphocytes and impaired level of B-cells CD45+CD3-CD19+CD5+CD27+). The data obtained indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by their clinical characteristics, but also by assessing markers of their immune system in order to make a correct diagnosis and prescribe etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy. Conclusions: 1. Autoimmune, proliferative and allergic diseases are directly related to disorders of the immune system. The severity of autoimmune disorders in the post-COVID period is more associated with basic corticosteroid therapy (GCS) both for the treatment of autoimmune processes and for the treatment of COVID-19 (except of treating autoimmune thyroiditis). GCS treatment used in acute period of infection reduced the number of recurrenct disorders. The situation is the opposite in rheumatoid arthritis: the use of GCS in the acute period of infection in patients already on basic corticosteroid therapy subsequently leads to an increase in the number of relapses in post-COVID patients. 2. In post-COVID patients, we revealed a trend towards an increase in the most clinically severe allergopathology: firstly, in all groups (52%) in the post-COVID period, exacerbations of such pathologies as Quincke’s edema, urticaria, anaphylaxis, vasculitis, alveolitis, and bronchiolitis became more frequent. These findings suggest that the worse condition of these patients in the post-COVID period was influenced by the past SARS-CoV-2 infection Allergic skin lesions were in second place in terms of the frequency of exacerbations (about 28%). 3. There is a tendency towards an increased frequency of proliferative diseases exacerbations in patients with more severe forms of acute COVID-19 infection. It should also be noted that the percentage of such patients is quite high, from 31.6% to 48%. 4. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the complement activation system, thus explaining clinical manifestations of post-COVID syndrome in the persons who had a mild form of COVID-19 without evidence of lung damage immune system affection. Our data indicate that the examination of post-COVID patients should be carried out not only by assessing their clinical characteristics, but also by examining the state of the immune system in such patients in order to make a correct diagnosis and administer etiological and pathogenetic therapy, including immune therapy.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Infectious bronchitis, an illness in avian diseases from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), causes considerable economic losses for poultry production. Although vaccination is a crucial preventive measure, viral mutations often limit its efficacy, underscoring the need to investigate IBV pathogenesis. This study showed that IBV can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in chicken macrophages, triggering IL-1β/IL-18 secretion and pyroptosis. Viral replication is essential for inflammasome activation, and blocking this pathway with MCC950 reduced inflammation but increased viral spread. The IBV nucleocapsid protein alone triggered inflammasome activation, indicating its critical role in pathogenesis. These findings reveal potential therapeutic targets for balancing antiviral immunity and inflammatory damage.">

        <tr id="Severe tissue injury and hemorrhagic shock can result in trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), acidosis, and hypothermia, denoted as lethal triad. This condition exacerbates trauma complications and contributes to organ dysfunction and mortality, prompting the need to better define its complex pathomechanisms in the blood. Therefore, we developed a standardized ex vivo human whole blood (hWB) model to differentiate the impact of various pathophysiological conditions, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and key inflammatory mediators on TIC development. Modelling incremental grades of the lethal triad, we assessed the resulting thrombo-coagulopathy by monitoring platelet activation, clot formation, and mediator release. Both acidosis and hypothermia independently triggered platelet activation (with enhanced surface CD62P/CD63 expression) and platelet consumption, leading to ex vivo clot formation. Completing the lethal triad with additional dilutional coagulopathy revealed even more pronounced effects. Further dissecting underlying cross-talk mechanisms, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or isolated platelets exposed to similar conditions exhibited no relevant impact on platelet function. Notably, histones—unlike HMGB1, pro-inflammatory cytokines or anaphylatoxins—amplified the lethal triad-driven hypercoagulative TIC response in both hWB and PRP. In conclusion, our findings in a modular, clinically relevant whole blood model highlight histones as a central driver of TIC. Furthermore, tracking early TIC progression in this model provides an effective and efficient platform for evaluating novel therapeutic approaches to target drivers of coagulopathy.

        <tr id="Introduction Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially severe systemic inflammatory condition triggered by various immunomodulatory therapies, making understanding its pathogenesis critical for improving patient outcomes. Results/Methods By combining immunotoxicology and systems biology approaches, we offer a novel and integrative conceptual model of CRS as an adverse outcome (AO), induced by five different immunomodulatory biotherapies: 1) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, 2) checkpoint inhibitors, 3) T cell engaging bispecific modalities, 4) monoclonal antibodies targeting and activating T cell receptors, and 5) FcγR activating monoclonal antibodies. This model uniquely integrates multiple CRS-inducing therapies into a unified framework, offering a comprehensive mechanistic representation of CRS pathophysiology. For that, we built an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) CRS network for these therapies and then developed a systems biology map of molecular mechanisms relevant to the AOP network. The map of mechanisms is made available via a dedicated online platform for exploration and data visualisation. It includes 24 cell types, 425 entities and 430 interactions. Discussion Beyond a static representation, the CRS Map serves as a dynamic tool for clinical and research applications, allowing researchers and clinicians to explore CRS progression in detail, identify biomarkers, and discover potential therapeutic targets. The map demonstrates stages of CRS progression and shows molecules that can be measured in relevant immunotoxicological assays, as well as potential drug targets for therapeutic intervention of CRS.">

        <tr id="Pyroptosis is a mode of inflammatory cell death, characterized by cell membrane rupture and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Pyroptosis is a critical part of the innate immune response and acts as a defense mechanism against different types of pathogens, including viruses. Several respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to trigger pyroptosis through distinct mechanisms. While pyroptosis is beneficial to the host by controlling virus replication and eliminating infected cells, the exaggerated induction of pyroptosis can be harmful and cause significant tissue damage, such as that to the lung tissue during infection with respiratory viruses. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and the role pyroptosis plays during respiratory virus infections could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the morbidity caused by these infections. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge obtained on the pathophysiological role of pyroptosis during different respiratory viral infections as well as some experimental approaches to regulating its detrimental effects to the host.">

        <tr id="Introduction Endothelial cells play a central role in the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI), yet we have limited understanding of the markers of microvascular-specific response. We therefore employed a translational approach integrating spatially resolved transcriptomics in a mouse SA-AKI model with validation in human kidney tissues and plasma, aiming to define the molecular signature of the endothelial response to SA-AKI in mice and in human patients. Methods In this post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data, we identified sepsis-associated target mRNAs and validated their expression via RT-qPCR in distinct renal microvascular compartments isolated by laser microdissection (LMD) from both cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mice and post-mortem kidney biopsies of SA-AKI patients. Additionally, we measured the corresponding circulating proteins in plasma from two patient cohorts with sepsis and SA-AKI: one consisting of patients presenting to the emergency department, and the other of patients with severe sepsis requiring organ support in the ICU. Results We identified several differentially expressed genes in the renal microvasculature following sepsis, including Mt1, Mt2, Saa3, Hp, C3, Sparc, Mmp8, and Chil3. Whole-organ samples from CLP mice also showed increased expression in the liver and lung. Except for SPARC, all genes were similarly upregulated in human kidney biopsies from SA-AKI patients. Circulating protein levels were elevated in sepsis and SA-AKI patients compared to controls; however, only CHI3L1 and MMP8 showed significantly higher levels in SA-AKI versus sepsis across both early and advanced stages. Conclusion Our findings reveal markers of the microvascular response to sepsis, which include increased levels of HP, C3, Chil3/CHI3L1, and MMP8, both at the transcriptomic level in mouse and human kidney microvasculature and at the protein level in circulating plasma of SA-AKI patients. The upregulation of these markers was shared across multiple organs and may reflect widespread endothelial activation contributing to sepsis pathophysiology.

The emergence of AID is due to both molecular mimicry and immune dysregulation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The review provides a description of individual cases of development of different AIDs, as well as the results of a number of cohort observational studies covering a period of 1-2 years, which analyzed large data sets of patients with COVID-19 infection. A unique aspect of AIDs following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other previously known viral pathogens is the extremely broad spectrum of conditions observed. The timing of AID manifestation after COVID-19 is characterized by marked variability (from 1 to 15 months). Among the autoimmune blood system diseases, the most common are autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIH) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which can develop within a few days after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.">

One widely discussed aspect of these vaccines is their uniquely broad spectrum and increased incidence of adverse events (AEs), collectively referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). Although the reported PVS rate is low, the high number of administered doses among healthy individuals has resulted in a substantial number of reported vaccine-related injuries. A prominent manifestation of PVS is multisystem inflammation, hypothesized to result from the systemic transfection of organ cells with genetic instructions for a toxin, the spike protein, delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). In this narrative review, we focus on endothelial cells in the microcirculatory networks of various organs as primary sites of transfection with mRNA-LNP and consequent PVS. We outline the anatomical variations in the microcirculation contributing to the individual variability of symptoms and examine the molecular and cellular responses to vaccine nanoparticle exposure at the endothelial cell level with a focus on the pathways of a sustained cascade of toxic and autoimmune processes. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying mRNA-LNP-induced AEs and PVS at the organ and cellular levels is critical for improving the safety of future vaccines and other therapeutic applications of this groundbreaking technology.">

Men are more prone to developing severe manifestations than women, suggesting a possible crucial role of sex hormones. 17,β-Estradiol (E2) and 1,25 α dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) act upon gene pathways as immunomodulators in several infectious respiratory diseases. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of E2 and calcitriol on the VSV-based pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We infected Vero E6 cells with the recombinant VSV-based pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 viruses according to the pre-treatment and pre–post-treatment models. The Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene expression did not change under different treatments. The VSV-based pseudovirus SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a significant decrease in the focus-forming unit count in the presence of E2 and calcitriol (either alone or in combination) in the pre-treatment model, while in the pre–post-treatment model, the infection was inhibited only in the presence of E2. Th SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighted a decrease in viral titres in the presence of E2 and calcitriol only in the pre–post-treatment model. 17,β-Estradiol and calcitriol can exert an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 infections, demonstrating their protective role against viral infections.">

DENV critically manipulates host cell mitochondria to ensure its replication and survival. The clinical manifestations are well-studied and how dengue infection significantly alters the mitochondrial dynamics, and the subsequent functional cellular homeostasis has been unveiled. This review discusses the strategies by which DENV alters mitochondrial functions and dynamics. It particularly focuses on the virus-induced suppression of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms like mitophagy. Moreover, the dichotomous role of mitophagy in supporting DENV replication is highlighted. By incorporating recent studies about DENV-host interactions at the mitochondrial interface, mitochondria, as regulators and targets in dengue pathogenesis, are suggested as possible molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Background: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major human pathogen, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality during seasonal outbreaks and pandemics. Human infection with IAV can lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and numerous clinical and basic research studies have established an association between IAV and pulmonary fibrosis (PF). However, the treatment of IAV-induced PF fibrosis has not been studied and discussed. Methods: An IAV-induced PF mouse model was established. Herbacetin (HBT) was identified as the most effective compound in the in vitro study of seven components of Rhodiola rosea L. (R. rosea L.). The effect of HBT on IAV-induced lung injury and PF was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The binding between HBT and neuraminidase (NA) protein was investigated by biological layer interferometry (BLI) and cell thermal shift assay (CETSA). Results: Following IAV infection, the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway is activated, leading to the upregulation of fibrosis-related proteins that promote fibrosis. HBT exhibited a significant ability to reduce influenza virus-induced lung injury and fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HBT binds to the NA protein of the influenza virus, reducing viral infection and the activation of the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, thereby mitigating the formation of lung injury and PF. Conclusions: HBT represents a promising therapeutic agent for modulating influenza virus-induced lung injury and PF, marking a significant step toward the development of effective treatments for influenza-induced PF.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to prolonged phenotypic and functional changes. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic‐activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT‐I cell proliferation after antigen presentation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days after RSV infection, especially impacting genes associated with MHC. Lasting upregulation of MHC‐I and MHC‐II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that RSV can induce prolonged upregulation of antigen presentation by LECs, with the potential to facilitate local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens and to enhance immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, though no longer classified as a global emergency, persists as a major public health challenge in 2025 due to the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. This paper reviews the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19, the critical interplay between obesity and disease severity, and advances in precision vaccination and therapeutics. Epidemiological and meta-analytic evidence highlights obesity as a significant independent risk factor for infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality, underpinned by mechanisms such as immune dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, and obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, obesity is shown to impair vaccine-induced immune responses, complicating long-term protection. In parallel, updated mRNA and protein-subunit vaccines, alongside emerging monoclonal antibody and antiviral strategies, reflect the shift toward precision medicine tailored to vulnerable populations, particularly the immunocompromised. While monoclonal antibody efficacy has been undermined by viral evolution, novel agents such as pemivibart and vilobelimab demonstrate promise in targeted settings. Collectively, the findings underscore the importance of sustained surveillance, equitable vaccine distribution, integrated obesity prevention, and personalized medical interventions. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt, long-term mitigation will require scientific innovation, public health vigilance, and commitment to global health equity.">

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life-threatening syndrome involving dysfunction of multiple immune cell types.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to comprehensively depict the dynamic trajectory of immune responses throughout the disease course of HBV-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF).


DESIGN
Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell proteomics were performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 45 samples from 17 patients who were hospitalised (progressive/stable/recovering course of HBV-ACLF, 6/5/6) and 15 control subjects (liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and healthy controls, 5/5/5). Functional and mechanistic experiments were validated in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
Single-cell multiomics analysis revealed specific changes in the peripheral immune response in ACLF. VCAN+CD14+-monocytes with activated interferon-stimulated genes and enhanced inflammatory functions, stimulated by HBV relapse and expanded in ACLF-1, fuelling early inflammatory storm. The subsequent apoptotic hepatocytes predominantly induce hyperinflammatory C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)+-neutrophils and CD163+-monocytes, enriching in patients with progressive ACLF and serving as significant markers of disease deterioration. Cytotoxic T-cells were functionally impaired and significantly decreased in progressive patients. CXCR2+-neutrophils exhibited immunosuppressive activity and induced the exhaustion of cytotoxic T-cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 significantly reduced neutrophils infiltration, restored cytotoxic T-cells and showed therapeutic effect in ACLF mice. Six immune cellular modules (CMs) were identified for patient stratification, with CM2 and CM6 showing strong predictive value for disease outcomes, and CM3 indicating a potential early therapeutic window.


CONCLUSION
Our longitudinal multiomics study revealed the dynamic evolution of the immune response in HBV-ACLF and characterised diverse immune patterns for the future precise management and therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, has emerged as a major public health concern following the COVID-19 pandemic. Although initially perceived as a respiratory illness, growing biomedical evidence confirms that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems. This study aimed to explore the clinical manifestations, risk factors, and long-term outcomes associated with long COVID and to identify patients at highest risk. The research also contributes to the ongoing discourse on establishing a unified definition of long COVID.A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted using data from 168 households, representing a weighted total of 14,769 households in Third Ward, Houston, Texas. Data were collected via interviewer-administered surveys and included variables on demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, COVID-19 symptom severity, and post-acute symptom persistence. Symptom variables were recoded as binary indicators, and weighted logistic regression models were applied to identify associations between acute phase characteristics and the development of long COVID.Risk factors significantly associated with long COVID included symptom severity during acute infection (OR = 29.58, 95% CI [1.38, 632.53]), heart disease (OR = 6.00, 95% CI [1.15, 31.28]), asthma (OR = 3.49, 95% CI [1.05, 11.59]), and poor physical health (OR = 4.20, 95% CI [1.12, 15.75]). Acute symptoms predictive of long COVID included anxiety (OR = 22.94, 95% CI [2.01, 262.31]), chest pain (OR = 7.15, 95% CI [1.13, 45.23]), constipation (OR = 16.81, 95% CI [1.33, 213.23]), heart palpitations (OR = 6.59, 95% CI [1.08, 40.18]), and shortness of breath (OR = 4.97, 95% CI [1.16, 21.36]). No statistically significant associations were found between long COVID and race, education, or income.The findings underscore the multisystemic nature of long COVID, characterized by a diverse range of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive impairment, shortness of breath, and neuropsychiatric issues such as depression. While clinical factors are critical in understanding long COVID, the results also suggest that addressing associated health outcomes requires broader consideration of social determinants of health.">

Beyond respiratory complications, the disease involves systemic manifestations driven by immune dysregulation, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Among the many mechanisms implicated in severe disease, a growing body of evidence suggests a central role for the imbalance between proteases and antiproteases. This review examines how dysregulated protease activity contributes to viral entry, cytokine activation, vascular injury, and thrombosis. We focus on the integration of proteolytic systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, coagulation cascade, and neutrophil extracellular traps with established pathways like endothelial dysfunction and immune hyperactivation. Furthermore, we highlight therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring proteolytic balance and discuss the potential relevance of this paradigm in the management of long COVID.">

Emerging studies link COVID-19 to adverse multi-organ outcomes. To better estimate psychiatric and physical illness after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we analyzed a nationally representative cohort with minimal prior infection (>99% uninfected) and low vaccination coverage (<1%) in Taiwan.


METHODS
We conducted a cohort study comprising 11,185 individuals who survived the first 30 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection (alpha variant) between May 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, along with three age- and sex-matched comparison groups: a contemporary control group (n = 223,700) with no COVID-19 diagnosis, a historical control group (n = 223,700) predating the pandemic, and seasonal influenza group (n = 44,740). We calculated the adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) of specific psychiatric and physical illnesses to compare their occurrence between the COVID-19 cohort and comparison groups.


RESULTS
During the 6 months after the first COVID-19 diagnosis, aIRRs for psychiatric illnesses in the COVID-19 group were higher across diagnostic categories than those of comparison groups. Moreover, aIRRs of physical illnesses in the COVID-19 group were higher across nearly all major organ systems compared to the comparison ones. The absolute rate difference for overall psychiatric illnesses was 7921.0 (COVID-19 vs contemporary control) and 7226.9 per 100,000 person-years (COVID-19 vs historical control), respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
SARS-CoV-2-immunologically naïve individuals have heightened risks of psychiatric illnesses across diagnostic categories and physical illnesses spanning nearly all major organ systems after the infection. Future studies warrant to explore the pathogenesis of these postacute effects.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immune dysfunction in liver disease contributes to significant morbidities, depending on liver damage severity and aetiology. We previously reported long‐lasting generalized CD8 T cell hyperfunction in chronic HCV infection with advanced fibrosis, yet its separation from viral and fibrosis‐driven effects, as well as clinical outcomes of advanced fibrosis, remains unclear. In a murine model of carbon tetrachloride‐induced progressive liver fibrosis, advanced fibrosis was observed by 12 weeks, with pathologies similar to those of human chronic HCV infection. Blood‐circulating CD8 T cells showed IFN‐γ and granzyme B (GrB) hyperfunction in response to anti‐CD3/28 stimulation, as well as impaired responses to ectopic tumour challenge and anti‐PD‐1/CTLA‐4 immunotherapy. Hyperfunction and impaired tumour responses were retained despite liver insult cessation. In a 45% HFD model, which induced steatosis and minimal fibrosis, IFN‐γ and GrB hyperfunction was also observed in blood‐circulating CD8 T cells. This study highlights a prolonged systemic CD8 T cell dysfunction acquired during progressive liver disease, associated with impaired antitumour and immunotherapy responses.

        <tr id="Since the end of 2019, people have been faced with infection, caused by a new strain of coronavirus – SARS-CoV-2. This disease has led to a pandemic, one of the global problems of mankind. Despite clinical manifestations of COVID-19 became milder with time, resembling features of seasonal viral infections, the persistent disturbances in various organs and systems were identified in former patients. It was found that, after suffering from COVID-19, a significant number of patients experience numerous disorders in both general health and complications of existing chronic diseases, including herpesvirus reactivation nd papillomavirus infection. In this regard, the scientific community has an additional task, a comprehensive and in-depth study of post-COVID syndrome to identify ways to improve the condition of patients. Currently, it has been revealed that about 90% of the world’s population is infected with herpesviruses. In some cases, one person may be found to have co-infection with different herpesviruses. Herpesvirus infections may be associated with a lot of conditions, from local labial herpes to generalized forms, malignant neoplasms and congenital malformations. It can occur both in acute and latent forms. The study of herpesvirus infection in the context of post-covid syndrome is one of the most pressing problems of modern medicine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in immune indexes in patients with post-COVID syndrome and with laboratory and clinically confirmed herpes virus type 6. To this purpose, changes in innate immune response indicators such as the complement system, phagocytic activity of neutrophils were assessed. Clinical data, immunological tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NBT test with nitroblue tetrazolium), and statistical analysis methods (Mann–Whitney criterion) were used for the study. The results have shown that that adverse reactions caused by the previous coronavirus infection are characterized by new aspects of disorders in adaptive and innate immune systems, thus leading to more serious consequences for immune system and the entire body, having been carefully studied and analyzed. The revealed changes indicate that the more pronounced disorders are observed in patients with post-COVID syndrome and a history of herpes virus type 6. This finding highlights the need for a more detailed study of their immune status, in order to develop individualized approaches to immunocorrection of immune system disorders in this group of patients, taking into account their herpesvirus history.">

        <tr id="Abstract Sepsis represents a dynamic, dysregulated host immune response to infection in which unconventional T cells—γδ T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and double-negative T cells—actively shape the balance between early hyperinflammation and subsequent immune paralysis across time and tissues. These cells employ unique antigen recognition mechanisms to trigger rapid immune responses. γδ T cells facilitate early pathogen elimination and immune regulation, whereas MAIT cells detect microbial metabolites and modulate the systemic inflammation. NKT cells balance immune homeostasis through dual pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This review classifies these subsets and examines their sepsis-related functions alongside immunotherapies targeting them, such as cytokine manipulation, immunomodulators, and checkpoint inhibitors. Elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying sepsis could advance therapies that restore immune equilibrium and potentially improve clinical outcomes. Future studies should unravel the interactions between unconventional T cells and broader immune networks while translating the findings into practical treatments. Understanding the dynamic roles of these cells provides pathways for tailored interventions in sepsis management.">

        <tr id="Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Identification and characterization of intracellular proteins with antiviral activity (known as restriction factors) is a key first step towards the future development of novel host-directed antiviral therapies. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of 14 different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) proteins against SARS-CoV-2. Overexpression of human guanylate binding protein (GBP) 1 resulted in potent inhibition of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, as well as against Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 variants of concern (VOCs). Moreover, knockdown or knockout of endogenous human GBP1 resulted in enhanced titers of SARS-CoV-2. While hGBP1 can restrict some viruses via actin remodeling, our data indicate that this is not the mechanism here. Moreover, we show that unlike GBP2 and GBP5, which impair spike protein processing, GBP1 did not reduce infectivity of spike-pseudotyped viruses following titration on Caco-2 cells. Multiple human GBPs have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro; however, we report no significant differences in virus titers recovered from the upper or lower airways of SARS-CoV-2-infected wild-type mice compared to from mice lacking the chromosome 3 cluster of mouse GBPs (GBP1/2/3/5/7). Together, our studies describe the ability of human GBP1 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, highlighting this host protein as a potential target for the development of host-directed antiviral therapies against this virus.IMPORTANCEViruses like SARS-CoV-2 can cause widespread illness and death. While currently licensed antiviral drugs are critical tools, drug resistance can develop. Our immune system produces intracellular proteins called "restriction factors" that can limit virus replication within cells. These proteins are promising targets for developing new antiviral therapies. In this study, we identified one such protein, human GBP1, which inhibited a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, including Delta and Omicron. Interestingly, GBP1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 through a different mechanism to that of other human GBPs as it did not interfere with prosessing of the viral spike protein. Of interest, a cluster of mouse GBPs, including GBP1, did not demontrate significant antiviral activity in a mouse model of infection. Overall, our findings suggest that human GBP1 could be a valuable target for host-directed antiviral strategies and highlight the limitations of using mouse models to study certain aspects of human innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is the leading cause of death globally (49 million cases per year with a 25-30% morbidity and mortality rate), but its immunopathology remains incompletely elucidated. Conventional models of ‘uncontrolled inflammation’ fail to explain the diversity of immune status in patients at different stages of the disease, and there is an urgent need for a dynamic, time-series perspective to reveal key regulatory nodes. Methods Forty-six studies (2014–2024) were retrieved under PRISMA-2020 across 12 databases. Raw single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and CITE-seq matrices (≈1 million immune cells) were uniformly reprocessed, harmonised with scMGNN, and mapped onto pseudotime and RNA-velocity trajectories. Ordinary and stochastic differential-equation models quantified pro-/anti-inflammatory flux. Results Multi-omics fusion increased immune-cell classification accuracy from 72.3% to 89.4% (adjusted Rand index, p< 0.001). Three phase-defining checkpoints emerged: monocyte-to-macrophage fate bifurcation at 16–24 h, initiation of TOX-driven CD8+ T-cell exhaustion at 36–48 h, and irreversible immunosuppression beyond 72 h. Dynamical simulations identified two intervention windows—0–18 h (selective MyD88–NF-κB blockade) and 36–48 h (PD-1/TIM-3 dual inhibition)—forecasting 2.1-fold and 1.6-fold survival gains, respectively, in pre-clinical models. Conclusion In this study, an “immune clock” model of sepsis was constructed based on single-cell multi-omics data, which accurately depicted three key decision nodes, namely, monocyte-macrophage differentiation, initiation of T-cell depletion and irreversible immune suppression, and identified the corresponding molecular targets (e.g., IRF8, TOX). This model provides a clear time window and targeting strategy for individualised immune intervention in sepsis.">

        <tr id="Long COVID is a persistent post-viral syndrome with the significant involvement of both the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, often extending well beyond the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging evidence has highlighted a spectrum of chronic alterations, including endothelial dysfunction, microvascular inflammation, perivascular fibrosis, and in some cases, the persistence of viral components in the cardiac and pulmonary tissues. At the molecular level, a sustained inflammatory milieu—characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6)—and chronic platelet hyperreactivity contribute to a prothrombotic state. These mechanisms are implicated in microvascular damage, cardiac strain, and impaired gas exchange, correlating with clinical manifestations such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and reduced exercise capacity. In certain patients, especially those who were not hospitalized during the acute phase, cardiac MRI and myocardial biopsy may reveal signs of myocardial inflammation and autonomic dysregulation. These often subclinical cardiovascular alterations underscore the need for improved diagnostic strategies, integrating molecular and histopathological markers during post-COVID evaluations. Recognizing persistent inflammatory and thrombotic activity may inform risk stratification and individualized therapeutic approaches. The interdependence between pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care. In this context, molecular and tissue-based diagnostics play a pivotal role in elucidating the long-term cardio-pulmonary sequelae of long COVID and guiding targeted interventions. Early identification and structured follow-up are essential to mitigate the burden of chronic complications in affected individuals.">

SOCS proteins inhibit cytokine signaling through various mechanisms, such as blocking STAT binding to JAKs and targeting proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. While these proteins maintain immune balance by suppressing excessive inflammatory responses, many viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2, exploit SOCS proteins to evade host immunity. In consequence, understanding their modulatory functions in viral disease has become increasingly relevant. Therefore, this review aims to describe and discuss studies involving SOCS expression data in COVID‐19 and their potential modulation as a valuable use for therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe fungal disease caused by Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) that may spread hematogenously to extrapulmonary organs. IPA is typically associated with a broad spectrum of immunocompromised conditions and constitutes a high mortality rate. While the association of influenza as a risk for secondary bacterial infections is well appreciated, emerging evidence indicates that influenza-hospitalized patients demonstrate increased susceptibility to severe aspergillosis infection. In this study, we developed a murine Influenza A Virus (IAV)-Af co-infection model and investigated the role of IAV host response in promoting invasive Af infection. Our data show that IAV temporarily suppresses neutrophil recruitment in the early phase of Af co-infection (24 hours), followed by a subsequent increase in neutrophil levels (48 hours). RNA sequencing analysis of neutrophils from IAV-Af co-infected lungs (48 hours) reveals enrichment of pathways regulating inflammatory responses and phagocytosis. Despite higher inflammatory response and phagocytosis, the host response from IAV-Af co-infected lungs had suppressive effects on neutrophil conidial killing, correlating with lung fungal load and invasion. However, the increased fungal invasion observed at 24 hours post co-infection, despite similar fungal loads in both groups (Af vs. IAV-Af), suggests that IAV-induced pathologic lung inflammation and vascular damage likely promote Af invasiveness during the initial phase of co-infection, and subsequently, the defects in neutrophil fungicidal response and exacerbated lung damage lead to sustained and fatal IPA pathogenesis in the later phase of co-infection.">

BACKGROUND

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with an overactive immune response, contributing to disease severity. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating inflammatory responses during viral infections, including COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES

This computational reanalysis explores the critical involvement of NF-κB signaling, particularly through toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and noncanonical pathways, in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, immune activation, and cytokine storm. We also discuss the crosstalk between NF-κB and other signaling pathways in the context of COVID-19, and summarize current and potential therapeutic strategies targeting NF-κB.

METHODS

An extensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, TLR signaling, NF-κB pathway activation, noncanonical NF-κB signaling, and anti-inflammatory drug interventions were analyzed and synthesized.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, often facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease activity. This viral entry triggers downstream immune signaling cascades, especially through TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8. TLR engagement activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. NF-κB signaling exhibits extensive crosstalk with other pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) activation, contributing to cytokine storm and lung injury. Several pharmacological agents, including corticosteroids, Inhibitor of κB Kinase ( IKK) inhibitors, and repurposed drugs like dexamethasone and resveratrol, show potential in mitigating NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

CONCLUSION

NF-κB signaling serves as a pivotal mediator of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and immune dysregulation. Targeting this pathway—particularly its noncanonical branches and TLR-mediated activation—offers promising therapeutic avenues. Understanding NF-κB crosstalk with other immune pathways may yield synergistic drug targets to improve COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the exacerbation of disease progression of both COVID-19 and HIV when coexisting. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between these two viruses are still poorly understood. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomics to identify and characterize peripheral blood cell subsets in COVID-19 and HIV-infected patients. Our findings revealed that COVID-19 and HIV exhibit a partially similar cellular composition and cell cycle distribution. Additionally, we identified a common pathogenesis in B-cell subsets of COVID-19 and HIV patients, which showed abnormal activation states of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Based on B-cell signature genes and UPR-related genes, we developed a machine learning diagnostic model that can accurately diagnose both COVID-19 and HIV infections. Our model was validated using a large number of bulk transcriptome data sets and showed good clinical efficacy. Our study provides molecular insights into the single-cell level interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infections, suggesting a possible common disease mechanism that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Long COVID (LC) is a post‐acute infection syndrome affecting 5%–10% of individuals infected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Here, we aimed to study SARS‐CoV‐2 humoral immunity, immunological imprinting by endemic coronaviruses, and previous herpesvirus infections in LC. We included 47 LC patients and 41 controls who fully recovered from COVID‐19. We assessed IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody levels against SARS‐CoV‐2, seasonal coronaviruses, and herpesviruses using ELISAs and Microblot‐Array panels. Additionally, we performed PCR to detect viral RNA/DNA and evaluated anti‐nuclear autoantibodies linked to systemic autoimmune conditions. LC patients showed significantly reduced levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 anti‐spike IgG and IgA but increased levels of endemic coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 anti‐spike IgG, suggesting immunological imprinting potentially driven by these coronaviruses. Furthermore, LC patients had higher levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 anti‐spike IgM compared to anti‐Spike IgG, possibly indicating impaired class switching. Interestingly, cytomegalovirus (CMV) p65 IgG levels were lower in LC patients and negatively correlated with fatigue severity. This study highlights immunological imprinting by seasonal coronaviruses and impaired antibody class switching as potential causes of SARS‐CoV‐2 immune escape and persistence in LC patients. Furthermore, our findings suggest an inverse association between CMV p65 IgG and fatigue severity in LC.">

        <tr id="Background Memory CD8+ T cells sense inflammation and rapidly produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) independent of cognate antigens. This innate-like property, called bystander activation, is involved in early host defense before the antigen-specific memory response. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this activation remain unknown. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα) belongs to the nuclear receptor family and regulates gene transcription in ligand-dependent manner. Although RORα is highly expressed in memory CD8+ T cells, its functional relevance has not been investigated. Methods Primary and secondary memory T cells that are sufficient or deficient of RORα were induced by adoptive transfer of naïve OT-I T cells to recipient mice and subsequent infection with Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (LM-OVA). RORα expression in memory T cells was examined by quantitative PCR. The target genes of RORα in memory T cells were explored by RNA-sequencing and verified by RORα overexpression in postactivated T cells. The impact of RORα-deficiency on bystander activation was assessed by stimulating memory T cells with inflammatory cytokines in vitro or injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into mice bearing memory T cells. Results RORα expression was remarkably elevated in secondary memory CD8+ T cells along with the enrichment of effector-like memory T cells. RORα primarily acted as a transcription factor in regulating the gene expression of the TL1A receptor. RORα deficiency abrogated the IFN-γ production by memory CD8+ T cells in response to IL-12 + TL1A in vitro and diminished the bystander response to LPS-induced inflammation in vivo. Conclusion This study revealed a regulatory mechanism of bystander activation. The findings also improve our understanding of how memory T cells increase their immediate protective capacity through repeated infections and vaccinations.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2, originally described as a respiratory pathogen, has been identified as a multisystem disease with complex and interconnected pathophysiological processes. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used to systematically review the evidence and identify and synthesize it in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases between January 2020 and May 2025. Of the 1410 screened records, 161 peer-reviewed studies involving more than 2 million patients were included in the analysis. The frequency of organ involvement, important biomarkers, and long-term outcomes were derived, and the quality of the studies was assessed using standardized tools. Results: The quantitative synthesis showed that 78%, 32%, 43%, and 28% of hospitalized patients had pulmonary, cardiovascular, 43% neurological, and 28% renal issues, respectively, with 10–35% showing persistent organ dysfunction at 6 months post-infection. The most common were cytokine storm (IL-6 (Interleukin-6) > 100 pg/mL in 72% of severe cases), endothelial dysfunction (biomarkers elevated in 87% of patients), and microvascular thrombosis (D-dimer > 2000 ng/mL in 46% of patients). Most domains were scored as having moderate-to-high confidence in the quality assessment. Conclusions: COVID-19 has long-term, multi-organ sequelae that require integrated multidisciplinary management. Healthcare systems should be ready to participate in long-term monitoring, rehabilitation, and special therapeutic development. The results offer a strong evidence base for clinical practice and post-pandemic health policy.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition that begins when the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This review examines the potential role of common viral infections in triggering or accelerating this autoimmune response. Key findings include that enteroviruses, especially Coxsackie B viruses, show the strongest association with new-onset type 1 diabetes. Other viruses—including mumps, rubella, rotavirus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2—have also been linked, though less consistently. Interestingly, some infections, such as cytomegalovirus or chickenpox, may even delay disease onset. Viruses may influence disease development by directly damaging pancreatic beta cells or by triggering immune confusion through molecular mimicry, where viral proteins resemble human ones. While no single virus is definitively proven to cause the disease, infections appear to accelerate or precipitate diabetes in genetically at-risk individuals. Understanding these interactions could support vaccine development, antiviral therapies, and early screening programs. Such approaches may help reduce the incidence or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes and its burden on individuals and healthcare systems.">

        <tr id="Background The contribution of antibody-mediated responses to COVID - 19 outcomes remains unclear, particularly regarding cross-reactivity with unrelated pathogens. While co-infections are known to influence disease progression, the broader landscape of IgG reactivity during SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been systematically explored. Methods We employed a high-density peptide microarray containing 4,344 linear epitopes from 37 viruses, 27 bacteria, 17 parasites, and 8 fungi to characterize serum IgG repertoires from individuals with moderate (n = 39) or severe (n = 40) COVID - 19. Controls included pre-pandemic healthy donors and a pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) formulation. Data analysis included intensity ranking, epitope mapping, and comparative analysis of mean signal intensities for each epitope between the COVID-Mod and COVID-Sev groups. Results COVID - 19 patients showed widespread IgG reactivity against diverse pathogens, with patterns differing by disease severity. Severe cases displayed broader and more intense reactivity, notably against hepatitis C virus (HCV), SARS-CoV-1, influenza A, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Plasmodium falciparum. Moderate cases showed preferential recognition of epitopes from HTLV-I, Neisseria meningitidis, and Trypanosoma cruzi. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates pre-existing humoral memory, possibly through epitope spreading or immune reprogramming. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection reshapes the IgG epitope repertoire in a severity-dependent manner, extending to antigens from unrelated pathogens. This phenomenon may reflect underlying immune dysregulation or idiotype-driven interactions. Comprehensive profiling of pathogen-related IgG responses may reveal potential biomarkers of disease severity. This phenomenon may inform future investigations aimed at improving personalized management strategies for co-infected or immunocompromised patients.">

        <tr id="Cell death pathways play contrasting roles in physiological processes such as responses to viral infections and vaccinations, potentially exerting either detrimental or beneficial effects. On one hand, uncontrolled cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. On the other hand, when properly regulated, these processes help establish an immunocompetent environment by activating innate immunity, which in turn stimulate antiviral immune responses. These mechanisms have emerged as promising targets for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics, immunotherapies, and vaccines. Recent advances have elucidated key aspects of cell death and DAMP pathways, highlighting their association with upstream viral sensors, their capacity to regulate immune responses, and their potential as therapeutic targets in the context of respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cell death and DAMP pathways, focusing on their roles in antiviral immunity and pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and vaccine immunogenicity.">

Multi-organ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveals upregulation of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory pathways in skin lesions and across multiple organs, especially in immune-related tissues. Abnormal activation of DNA replication and cell cycle signaling pathways, which may contribute to enhanced viral replication, is evident in both MPXV and SIV-MPXV co-infected groups.

Here we intended to investigate the potential involvement of toll-like receptors (TLRs)3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: mRNA expression of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 were evaluated in blood samples from 30 COVID-19-infected patients and 30 healthy controls by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach. Results: The mRNA expressions of TLR3 (P = 0.038) and TLR9 (P = 0.009) significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls. Additionally, the mRNA expression of TLR3 was significantly higher in the male than in female COVID-19 patients (P = 0.020). Experiments indicated that the mRNA expression of TLRs was not significantly different between symptomatic and non-symptomatic COVID-19 subjects. Furthermore, no correlation was detected between mRNA expression of TLRs and patient’s clinicopathological data. Conclusion: It seems that TLR3 and TLR9 are involved during COVID-19 infection and might take part in the inflammatory outcome of the patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the critical need for broad-spectrum antivirals with high resistance barriers. Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-β receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, isothermal titration calorimetry, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupts its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36–48 hours post-infection [hpi]), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-β-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release—processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 751.8 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favorable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-β/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-β-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection, collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-β signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure—a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Women are disproportionately affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19. However, whether there are central nervous system-specific changes in gene expression in women with neuropsychiatric Long COVID (NP-Long COVID) remains unknown.


METHODS
Twenty-two women with and ten women without NP-Long COVID were enrolled from New Haven, CT, and the surrounding region and consented to a blood draw and large volume lumbar puncture. Total RNA was extracted from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Polyadenylated RNA was sequenced, and differential expression analyses were performed.


RESULTS
Both CSF and PBMC samples showed differential gene expression associated with Long COVID status. There were CSF-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in people with Long COVID, including in genes related to oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, and P53 response, indicating compartment-specific immune responses. Some pathways were dysregulated in both the CSF and PBMC of Long COVID compared to controls, including those related to androgen response, MTORC1 signaling, and lipid metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS

        <tr id="The circulatory and immune systems function in close coordination to maintain homeostasis and act as a frontline defense against infections. However, under certain conditions, this interaction becomes dysregulated, leading to thromboinflammation, a pathological process marked by the concurrent and excessive activation of coagulation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. During viral infections, this phenomenon can markedly worsen clinical outcomes. Evidence indicates that viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, influenza, and SARS-CoV can trigger thromboinflammatory responses involving platelet activation, the release of procoagulant and pro-inflammatory mediators, and the formation of thrombi within blood vessels. While this response may initially help contain viral dissemination, in cases of high viremia it can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemorrhage, and multiple organ failure. This review compiles current evidence on thromboinflammatory mechanisms induced by arboviral and respiratory viruses and examines how these processes contribute to diseases’ pathogenesis and clinical severity.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading pathogen of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children under 5 years of age worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia in infants and children causes more deaths than influenza each year due to the high rate of severe illness. There is a lack of safe and effective antiviral drugs, and the development of novel antirespiratory syncytial virus drugs is of great clinical importance. Selenomethionine (SeMet), as the main ingredient in commercially available selenium supplements, exerts excellent antioxidant, antiviral, immunomodulatory, and other physiological functions mainly in the form of selenoprotein. The antiviral mechanism of SeMet anti-RSV was explored by detecting the apoptotic state, the degree of DNA damage, cytokine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) secretion levels, and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Meanwhile, this study screened the affinity of SeMet for common RSV target proteins and explored the dynamic interactions between SeMet and the screened viral target proteins.Conclusions: SeMet inhibited apoptosis and inflammatory responses by regulating the ROS-mediated PARP/Bcl-2, NF-κB/JAK1-STAT3 signaling pathways. Meanwhile, SeMet formed a stable interaction with RSV polymerase and may bind to key amino acid residues of RSV polymerase mainly through hydrogen bonding.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, cause severe infections of the respiratory system. Cohort studies and clinical observations indicate that patients with severe influenza A virus (IAV) infections are at an increased risk of developing an ischemic stroke event. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To this end, we investigated the consequences of IAV infection on cerebral damage in a mouse model of ischemic stroke.


METHODS
We intranasally inoculated male C57BL6/N mice with the mouse-adapted IAV strain A/Puerto Rico 8/34 or PBS as a vehicle control. At 3, 7, and 10 days post-infection, mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by sacrifice 24 hours after reperfusion for subsequent analysis. The anticoagulant drug acetylsalicylic acid was administered as treatment 1 day before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.


RESULTS
Our research demonstrated a time-dependent deterioration of cerebral ischemia after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, resulting in increased infarct volume and a worsened neurological outcome at the propagation and inflammation phases of infection. Our observations revealed an elevation in procoagulant activity and an increase in thrombosis within the microvasculature after infection and stroke. This effect was attributed to an infection-mediated inflammatory milieu and accelerated neutrophil response. Upon infection, the release of increased neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils had detrimental consequences for transient middle cerebral artery occlusion development. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid or control antiviral therapy prevented the IAV-induced exacerbation of stroke and reduced brain damage by reducing NETosis and coagulation.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that IAV infections enhance the systemic propensity for NETosis and foster a procoagulant state, thereby increasing the risk of cerebral damage and thrombosis following stroke. Targeting a combination of neutrophils and coagulation molecules simultaneously represents a promising treatment approach for clinical stroke.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant global impact on the respiratory system and multiple organ systems, including the nervous system. Neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection and its vaccines have been increasingly recognised, ranging from problems with smell and taste to more severe conditions such as encephalitis, stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. This narrative review critically evaluates the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection and its vaccines, providing insights into potential pathophysiological mechanisms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, and data were retrieved from various databases. The prevalence, types, and severity of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients were discussed. The possible mechanisms of neurological injury in COVID-19 were explored, including direct viral invasion, hypoxic brain injury, immune-mediated damage, and cerebrovascular injury. Furthermore, the review addressed the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 vaccination. While severe vaccine-related adverse effects remain rare, understanding their occurrence is essential for risk assessment and public health interventions. In conclusion, COVID-19 can affect the nervous system in various ways, leading to various neurological symptoms. Further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of these manifestations and develop effective preventive and treatment strategies to manage this global health crisis.">

We report that CD24-Fc treatment significantly reduced inflammation and immune hyperactivation in humanized mice with HIV-1 infection and cART. CD24-Fc treatment improved recovery of CD4 T cells, reduced immune hyper-activation, increased functional central memory T cells. Notably, CD24-Fc treatment increased CXCR5 + CD8 central memory T cells (TCM) with increased HIV-specific polyfunctionality in humanized mice and in PBMC from PWH. This enhanced anti-HIV T cell activity was associated with improved control of HIV-1 viral rebound and reduced HIV-1 pathogenesis upon cART cessation.

        <tr id="Abstract The obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect a third of the world’s population. Toxoplasmosis is considered a significant worldwide disease that can lead to morbidity or death in immunocompromised individuals. Host defense against T. gondii has been demonstrated to be dependent on a rapid myeloid cell and lymphocyte response working in concert to quickly eliminate the invading pathogen. Classically, T-bet–dependent group 1 innate lymphocytes (ILC1s), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+ T cell–derived interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are considered indispensable for host resistance against T. gondii. However, recent discoveries have illustrated that T-bet is not required for NK cell– or CD4+ T cell–derived IFN-γ. Yet, lack of T-bet still results in rapid mortality, pointing to a T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–mediated host defense pathway. This review summarizes the myeloid cell–mediated immune response against T. gondii and provides insights into the lesser known components of the T-bet–dependent myeloid cell–dependent host defense pathway for pathogen clearance.">

        <tr id="Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways influenced by a complex network of cytokines and chemokines, among which CXC chemokine ligand 3 (CXCL3) plays an important role and has been linked to airway remodeling and disease severity. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, induces systemic immune dysregulation with elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and D-dimer. The interaction between CXCL3-mediated airway inflammation and systemic inflammatory responses in asthmatic patients during COVID-19 infection remains insufficiently elucidated, with limited data clarifying its contribution to disease severity and outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the correlation of serum CXCL3 and classical inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) with asthma severity among patients with and without COVID-19 infection and to determine their relationship with lung function (FEV₁) and predictors of severe asthma. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 asthmatic patients, stratified according to COVID-19 infection status (76 positive, 124 negative). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were analyzed. Serum levels of CXCL3 and inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer) were compared between groups and correlated with asthma severity and FEV₁. Results: COVID-19-positive asthmatics exhibited significantly higher levels of CXCL3 (241.5 ± 83.7 vs. 173.8 ± 76.4 ng/mL, p<0.001) and inflammatory markers, along with lower FEV₁ (54.3 ± 17.2 vs. 62.1 ± 18.9; p=0.003) compared to COVID-19-negative patients. CXCL3, CRP, and D-dimer levels increased progressively with asthma severity (p<0.001), furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between CXCL3 and asthma severity (r = 0.62) as well as between CXCL3 and CRP (r = 0.41). Logistic regression revealed FEV₁ <60% as an independent predictor of severe asthma (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.78–5.47, p<0.001), whereas COVID-19 infection showed an inverse association with severe asthma (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.91, p=0.026). Conclusion: Serum CXCL3 and systemic inflammatory markers are significantly associated with asthma severity and lung function impairment, particularly in the presence of COVID-19 infection. CXCL3 may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing asthma severity and guiding clinical management in patients with concurrent COVID-19.

However, direct studies of these viruses in humans are limited by ethical constraints, technical challenges, and their strict species specificity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have developed surrogate models, with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) emerging as a tractable and widely utilized system. MHV68 shares key genetic and biological features with EBV and KSHV, providing critical insights into GHV pathogenesis, including viral latency, reactivation, immune evasion, and virus‐host interactions. This review summarizes current cellular and animal models for GHV research, highlighting the advantages and limitations of MHV68 as a model for studying human GHVs. We explore mechanisms of viral gene function, immune modulation, and host responses, and discuss how these models have advanced our understanding of GHV‐associated diseases. Improved model systems will be essential for guiding future experimental approaches and developing targeted therapies for GHV‐driven malignancies and other related disorders.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped positive sense RNA virus and the causative agent of COVID-19. The viral envelope includes the spike (S) glycoprotein which mediates the entry of the virus to the host cell. The S protein comprises the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor on the surface of target cells. ACE 2 is highly expressed on the endothelium lining blood vessels which may explain the cardiovascular symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) may share important mechanisms that regulate their pathogenesis and that endothelial dysfunction (ED), which has been already shown to be tightly linked to CVD, plays an instrumental role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by mainly affecting the hyperinflammatory and coaguloatory states that are seen during disease progression. Meanwhile, there is also increasing evidence suggesting that COVID-19-linked ED is due to a dysregulation in lipid metabolism pathways. Of note, it has been reported that low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels correlate with the severity of COVID-19 through a potential impairment in the antioxidant capacity of HDL which may lead to lipid oxidation and the generation of oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL). Interestingly, we have previously shown that myeloperoxidase oxidized LDL (Mox-LDL) possesses an anti-fibrinolytic activity in endothelial cells; this may negatively affect the course of COVID-19 by increasing the chance of complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation events and ischemic strokes. In this article, I hypothesize that targeting inflammatory dyslipidemia could be highly beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients and improving their clinical outcome.">

To investigate this, male and female mice were colonized with BA prior to induction of ARDS using dual doses of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a potent superantigen that triggers cytokine storm–driven lung injury. Clinical parameters, histopathology, gene expression, ELISA, flow cytometry, and gut barrier assessments were used to evaluate outcomes. BA pre-treatment significantly improved lung function, and attenuated pulmonary inflammation in male mice, correlating with increased IL-22, expansion of γδ T cells, and upregulation of colonic tight junction proteins. In contrast, BA exacerbated ARDS symptoms in females, increasing Th17 responses, neutrophil infiltration, and IgA-associated immune activation while impairing gut barrier integrity. These findings reveal that BA exerts divergent, sex-dependent effects in ARDS, highlighting the critical need to consider sex as a biological variable in microbiome-based therapies targeting inflammatory lung disease.">

        <tr id="Pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide, has been utilized for over three decades as an immunomodulatory agent to prevent recurrent respiratory infections, particularly in immunocompromised populations such as children and the elderly. Originally developed for its ability to enhance innate and adaptive immune responses, pidotimod is now being revisited in light of new clinical insights and emerging therapeutic needs. Recent studies have expanded its potential beyond traditional indications, with evidence supporting its role in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, and even viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Pidotimod exerts its effects by stimulating dendritic cells, enhancing toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, and promoting cytokine production, including IL-2 and IFN-γ, thereby supporting both cellular and humoral immunity. This broad-spectrum immune modulation makes pidotimod a promising adjunct in managing immune-mediated diseases and infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. In this review, we examine pidotimod’s pharmacodynamics, summarize clinical evidence from recent studies, and explore its evolving role in modern therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases. Given its safety profile and oral administration, pidotimod holds significant promise not only for preventing infections but also as part of a broader immunomodulatory approach in complex disease management.">

Cancer cell ‘dormancy’ results from an equilibrium between tumor cell division and apoptosis, and provides an explanation for relapse and metastasis that can occur months, years, or decades after treatment. In July 2025, findings from a study in mice infected with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 showed the rapid loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast carcinoma cells in the lung, and expansion of metastatic carcinoma cells within weeks. Animal model findings support findings in cancer survivors that SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung metastasis and cancer-related mortality. This Editorial aims to highlight findings from real-world population studies on the association between COVID-19 and cancer and new experimental findings for how SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and possibly other respiratory viruses may ‘awaken’ dormant cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammatory conditions often involve the dysregulation of key enzymes, including serine proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which are key proteins implicated in the cellular entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. It remains uncertain whether the gastrointestinal symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients result from direct viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract, a process that may be exacerbated by altered expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2. In this review, we explore the interplay among ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including their roles in disease pathology and response to therapy. We also examine methodological approaches for assessing whether protease alterations contribute to increased susceptibility to infection, considering that TMPRSS2 exists in inactive (zymogen) and active forms. Furthermore, while membrane-bound ACE2 facilitates viral entry, soluble ACE2 fragments may act as decoys, preventing virus–receptor interaction. Therefore, the interpretation of changes in full-length versus cleaved forms of ACE2 and related enzymes is critical for understanding vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) has long been recognized as a cause of fatal encephalitis in animals and was only recently identified as a zoonotic pathogen causing a similar disease in humans. This study provides the first comprehensive comparative analysis of BoDV-1-induced neuropathology in human and animal end hosts, including horses, sheep, and alpacas. Using immunohistochemical analyses, we investigated the topographical distribution of BoDV-1 and inflammatory responses in the central nervous system across 19 cases. Key findings reveal distinct differences and overlaps between humans and animals. While humans exhibited heterogeneous patterns especially of the lymphocyte infiltration, animals displayed more species-specific inflammation and viral spread patterns. In horses, the hippocampus and basal ganglia were consistently affected, whereas sheep showed predominant involvement of the frontal cortex and stria olfactoria. Alpacas demonstrated a less uniform distribution but highlighted the brainstem and basal ganglia as critical sites. Intriguingly, across all species, a negative association was observed between lymphocyte infiltration and the number of BoDV-1-infected cells. These findings enhance our understanding of BoDV-1 pathogenesis and is a first step of cross-species comparison in unraveling disease mechanisms in BoDV-1 infection. Further research is warranted to elucidate the implications of these findings for therapeutic strategies and to explore the entry and dissemination routes of BoDV-1 in different hosts.">

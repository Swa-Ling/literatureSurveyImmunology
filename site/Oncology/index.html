        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID‐19 commonly leads to respiratory issues, yet numerous patients also exhibit a diverse range of neurological conditions, suggesting a detrimental impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 or the viral Spike protein on the central nervous system. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="With the consistent occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the prevalence of various ocular complications has increased over time. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this review is to focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and intraocular neuroinflammation and to discuss current evidence and future perspectives, especially possible connections between conditions and potential treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a pathogen that primarily targets the respiratory system and can lead to severe conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, three—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2—are associated with severe illness and significant morbidity. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cellular entry. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly mutable, leading to the emergence of variants that alter disease pathology and transmission dynamics. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified these mutations into variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), and variants under monitoring (VUMs). This review provides an in-depth analysis of both historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, summarizes recent advancements in diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and discusses current therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, with a particular focus on virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines developed in recent years. Additionally, we highlight ongoing therapeutic approaches and their implications for managing COVID-19.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly enhanced our understanding of CD8+ T cell immunity and their role in natural infection and vaccine-induced protection. Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

Therefore, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody responses among naturally infected individuals and individuals who achieved hybrid immunity in a large Canadian cohort. We demonstrate that anti-Spike IgGs and neutralizing antibody dynamics vary greatly among individuals with COVID-19, in peak antibody levels, rate of waning, and longevity of the antibody response. Additionally, we found an association between robust antibody responses and individuals with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms during the first-month post-symptom onset. For individuals who achieved hybrid immunity, a robust increase in anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibodies followed the first vaccination dose; however, there was a minimal increase in the anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers after administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies elicited by the wild-type virus alone were largely ineffective against emerging variants of concern in our natural infection-only cohort, in contrast to a much broader and more robust neutralization profile observed in individuals who achieved hybrid immunity. Our findings emphasize the need for global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts to further sustain protective immune responses required to minimize viral spread and disease severity in the population. As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, understanding the interplay between previous infections, vaccine durability, and virus evolution will be critical for guiding ongoing vaccination strategies.


IMPORTANCE
A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody response after infection and/or vaccination. Our paper addresses this in a large Canadian cohort with antibody responses that were generated by natural infection as well as vaccine in some persons studied.">

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 involves several organs, but its basis remains poorly understood. Some infected cells in mice survive the acute infection and persist for extended periods in the respiratory tract but not in other tissues. Here, we describe two experimental models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to assess the effect of viral virulence on previously infected cells. Both approaches use lineage tracking of previously infected cells. In mice infected with a highly pathogenic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) but not alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells survived the acute infection. These cells became activated, differentiated into an AT2-to-AT1 transitional cell state (KRT8+ pre-alveolar type 1 transitional cell state). Additionally, nearby uninfected AT2 cells upregulated the transitional marker KRT8, thereby contributing to lung regeneration. In mice sensitized to infection by transduction with Ad5-hACE2, the infection is nonlethal, and AT1 cells survived the infection. Consequently, recovery in these mice was more rapid. Taken together, these results provide an explanation for how SARS-CoV-2 virulence contributes to poor outcomes and affects clinical recovery and lung regeneration. We also identified a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts lung recovery, even at times when infectious virus cannot be detected. IMPORTANCE A major consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is that many survivors have long-term sequelae, which are not well understood. These involve many organs, with the respiratory tract being a common site of long-term effects. Many of these sequelae can be found in mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we have focused on the lungs, with particular interest in the fate and role of cells that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and survived the acute infection. We found that some infected cells survive acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that these surviving cells both contribute to the immune response in the lungs and are involved in lung recovery. These findings illustrate previously unexplored aspects of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia and may be relevant for understanding aspects of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

        <tr id="Interpreting viral mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 based on human body level is critical for developing more efficient interventions. Due to the limitation of data, limited models consider the viral dynamics of early phase of infection. The Human Challenge Study Killingley et al. (2022) enables us to garner data from the inoculation to the 14th day after the infection, which provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 within host infection dynamics. In the Human Challenge Study, each volunteer was inoculated with 10TCID50, approximately 55PFU, of a wild type of virus (Killingley et al. (2022)), and the data indicates that the viral load reduced below the detectable level within a day. The simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023) explain the data from the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)). However, they do not explain the viral decay from Day 0 to Day 1. Hence, in this paper, we aim to develop a new viral mechanism to explain this phenomenon. Based on the simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023), we consider that the virus will first go through an adjustment phase and then start to replicate. A new dose-response model is developed to evaluate the probability of infection by constructing a boundary problem. We will discuss this viral mechanism and fit the model to the data of the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)) by adopting AMC-SMC (approximate Bayesian computation-sequential Monte Carlo). Based on the results of parameter inference, we estimate that the adjusted viral load is around 1% of the inoculated viral load.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Type III interferons (IFNs) primarily act on epithelial cells and protect against virus infection of the mucosa, whereas type I IFNs act more systemically. To date, it has been unknown which epithelial subtypes in the upper airways, the primary site for initial infection for most respiratory viruses, primarily rely on type III IFN or type I IFNs for antiviral protection. To address this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptomics analysis of the epithelial IFN-mediated response focusing on the upper airways of mice. This work identified nine distinct cell types derived from the olfactory epithelium and thirteen distinct cell types from the respiratory epithelium. Interestingly, type I IFNs induced a stronger antiviral transcriptional response than type III IFN in respiratory epithelial cells, whereas in olfactory epithelial cells, including sustentacular (SUS) and Bowman’s gland cells (BGC), type III IFN was more dominant compared to type I IFN. SUS and BGC, which provide structural support and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, were highly susceptible to infection with a mouse-adapted variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA20) but were protected against infection if the animals were prophylactically treated with type III IFN. These findings demonstrate a high degree of cell type heterogeneity in terms of interferon-mediated antiviral responses and reveal a potent role for type III IFNs in protecting the olfactory epithelium. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 infects SUS and BGC in the olfactory epithelium, causing an impairment of structural support and integrity of olfactory sensory neurons that can result in severe olfactory dysfunctions. We observed an unexpected compartmentalization of the IFN-mediated transcriptional response within the airway epithelium, and we found that olfactory epithelial cells preferentially respond to type III IFN, which resulted in robust antiviral protection of SUS and BGC. Given the proximity of the olfactory epithelium to the central nervous system, we hypothesize that evolution favored a type III IFN-biased antiviral immune response in this tissue to limit inflammatory responses in the brain. Cell type-specific antiviral responses in the upper airways, triggered by the different types of IFNs, should be investigated in more detail and carefully taken into consideration during the development of IFN-based antivirals for clinical use.">

        <tr id="Monocytes and macrophages, as important constituents of the innate immune system, are equipped with multiple Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) to recognize invading pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, and mount an antiviral response. Nevertheless, their uncontrolled activation can lead to hyperinflammation seen in severe COVID-19. Surprisingly, we observed that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins triggered only a weak proinflammatory response in human peripheral blood monocytes. By employing THP-1 and Jurkat NF-κB::eGFP reporter cell lines expressing specific TLRs, various TLR ligands and blocking antibodies, we determined that surface TLRs, including TLR2/1, TLR2/6 and TLR4 do not play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 sensing. However, monocytes are potently activated by the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, and the response correlates with the viral uptake that is observed only in monocytes, but not in lymphocytes. We show that monocyte activation involves two distinct steps. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes in a process independent of the S protein and the prime SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Instead, the alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor CD147, which is highly expressed on monocytes, recognizes its well-known interaction partners cyclophilins A and B that are incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 virions. Secondly, upon viral uptake via the cyclophilin-CD147 interaction, that can be inhibited by specific CD147 blocking antibodies or competition with recombinant human cyclophilin A and B, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recognized by TLR7/8 in endosomes, leading to upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, comprising the core hyperinflammatory signature. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism how human monocytes sense SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting the cyclophilin-CD147 axis might be beneficial to alleviate overt myeloid-driven inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis is a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. The host response correlates of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis remain unclear, thereby limiting therapeutic development. We therefore performed proteomic and transcriptomic phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis in Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. We included a bioenergetics focus given the emerging role of mitochondrial function in enteroviral myocarditis. Early (<30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). Values are log10 transformed, and p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons across the full twenty biomarkers (six shown here; * indicates a p-value < 0.05). CRP = C-Reactive Protein; IFNG = Interferon Gamma ; PCT= Procalcitonin; TNFR1 = Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; DDIMER = D-dimer; and IL1RA = Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Methods We previously adjudicated five unvaccinated pre-Delta SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis cases among 5265 MHS beneficiaries who enrolled into the EPICC study with COVID-19; four of these cases had blood collected. We matched myocarditis cases 1:10 with sex, age, comorbidity, and blood sampling-time matched controls (SARS-CoV-2 infection with no myocarditis) from the EPICC study. Cases and controls underwent comparison of early (< 30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay (with multiplicity adjustment). We also performed early whole blood transcriptomic sequencing with DESeq2 and GSEA analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways, including mitochondrial (mtDNA) regulated innate immune pathways (with FDR for multiple comparisons). Gene set enrichment analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). FDR = False Discovery Rate; NES = Normalized enrichment score. Results We detected higher post-infection Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1) and procalcitonin (PCT) plasma concentrations in myocarditis cases versus matched controls (TNFR1: 0.33 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.032; PCT: 0.59 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.02) (Fig 1). We noted no statistically significant difference in the 18 other proteomic markers tested. GSEA analysis noted upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS pathway genes, and downregulated mtDNA innate immune genes, in cases versus controls (FDR < 0.05) (Fig 2). Conclusion In this MHS study, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was associated with elevation of TNFR1 and PCT secretion, upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS gene expression, and downregulated mtDNA innate immunity. While constrained by small sample sizes of a rare complication, these biomarker associations prompt mechanistic studies which may direct development of therapies for myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

        <tr id="Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) ligands effectively reduce immunopathological damage in viral pneumonia models. Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

 The SARS-CoV-2 virus started the global COVID-19 outbreak that is still ongoing. Chronic lung inflammation and a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm produced by SARS-CoV-2-infected human respiratory epithelial cells for others, the cytokine storm stood for a strong inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. Among the organs, gastrointestinal tract, brain, cardiovascular system, liver, kidneys, microcirculation, eyes, and so on, cytokine storms can harm Considering the everyday mortality, research on targeted antiviral medicine compositions and vaccination production is under progress. Prebiotics seem to be immunomodulators and antiviral agents, therefore strengthening the human immune system according recent scientific data. Prebiotics enhanced the maturation, differentiation, and lymphocyte and macrophage proliferation, thereby increasing COVID-19 immunity. They also triggered the reticuloendothelial system, raised the fraction of CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), and improved COVID-19 immunity by this means. Dietary interventions like prebiotics and anti-SARS-CoV-2 have opened opportunities for the development of microbial therapeutics intended either to prevent or treat COVID-19. Prebiotics are specialized dietary components necessary for the survival and nutritional absorption of gut probiotic microorganisms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 since 2019 caused substantial global morbidity and mortality and continues to burden healthcare systems worldwide. Public health measures implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread also reduced circulation of other seasonal respiratory viruses, likely causing gaps in population-level immunity. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may dampen immune responses against other pathogens is highly debated and not well understood.Figure 1. VirScan analyses of serum samples pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A) VirScan total epitope hits and geometric mean (gMean) of epitope binding (EB) scores for SARS-CoV-2 pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (B) gMean of EB scores for select pathogens pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Timepoints included in the VirScan analyses were between 15-174 days prior to and 31-155 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gray lines denote paired samples for individual subjects. Statistically significant adjusted p values of < 0.05 were determined using paired t test with Holm correction. Methods In 2022, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunocompetent adults ( > 18 years) with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination history and increased risk of social or occupational exposure to respiratory viruses. Subjects were followed for 6 months and weekly symptom surveys, blood samples at enrollment, 3 and 6 months post-enrollment, and nasal swabs at report of symptoms were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR (OpenArray) for 27 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Serum antibodies were assessed by VirScan PhIP-seq for specificity to a broad library of antigen epitopes for clinically relevant pathogens, measuring total epitope hits and epitope binding (EB) scores, a measure similar to antibody titer. Results Of 43 subjects with paired serum samples > 1 week prior to and > 28 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 subjects with viral load < Ct 22.2 were assessed by VirScan. SARS-CoV-2 epitope hits and EB scores were significantly increased post-infection compared to pre-infection (Fig 1A). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with reduced EB scores for adenovirus D and S. aureus (Fig 1B). However, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with a statistically significant decline of epitope hits or EB scores for most other clinically relevant pathogens. Conclusion We assessed broad changes in the antibody repertoires of subjects prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinically relevant pathogens at the epitope level by VirScan. Together these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with differential patterns of antibody repertoire kinetics for most non-coronavirus respiratory pathogens in immunocompetent adults. Further analyses in larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Disclosures Michael J.

        <tr id="Background Post-COVID entails persistent symptoms following a presumed or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aims to evaluate post-COVID general health symptoms reported by patients with IMIDs. Methods An online questionnaire was distributed to IMID patients on systemic therapy at dermatology, rheumatology, and gastroenterology departments in the Netherlands. General health symptoms were compared between patients with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for disease-related factors and known post-COVID risk factors. Self-reported prevalence of post-COVID symptoms was assessed by asking patients if they linked their symptoms to the previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results A total of 1518 patients were included, and 58% (n = 877) reported ≥1 SARS-CoV-2 infections. When assessing self-reported prevalence of post-COVID symptoms, 13.9% (122/877) linked their symptoms to a previous infection. Patients with a previous infection showed higher prevalence of symptoms than those without (56.2%, 43.9%; P < 0.001), and higher prevalence of fatigue (42%, 32%; P < 0.001). After adjusting for potential risk factors, previous infection was associated with symptoms (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.23–1.91; P < 0.001), and fatigue (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.04–1.64; P = 0.021). Subanalysis showed an association between self-reported COVID-19 severity and symptoms, while presumed SARS-CoV-2 variant (based on date of reported infection) and number of infections were not associated. Conclusion The self-reported prevalence of general health symptoms, particularly fatigue, is significantly higher in IMID patients with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cause of this increase requires further investigation and might provide insights into the pathogenesis of post-COVID, both relevant for IMID patients as well as the general population.">

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases and infections can produce lasting effects on brain function, yet the spatial molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of 40 postmortem brain samples from patients with Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and severe COVID-19. Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer-and region-specificity. In Parkinson’s disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Integration of miRNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics uncovered layer-specific regulatory patterns, including neuroinflammation-associated miR-155. This atlas provides unprecedented insights into disease pathology and highlights the critical importance of spatial molecular context in understanding brain disorders.

        <tr id="Introduction Global WHO data indicate that Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, such as Kenya, experienced reduced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe-morbidity and mortality burdens relative to their more affluent counterparts in Europe, Asia, and North America. Methods We analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples collected from Kenya and Sweden before and during COVID-19. Pre-COVID-19 samples were available for 80 adults and 10 infants from Kenya, and 20 adults from Sweden. COVID-19 samples were available for 39 Kenyan adults. The samples were analysed for ex vivo IFN-{gamma} secretion using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent (ELISpot) assay following in vitro stimulations with overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein peptides. T-cells expressing IFN-{gamma}, IL-2, TNF-, CD154, and CD107a were assessed following similar stimulations, using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and multiparameter flow cytometry. Results 55.7% of the Kenyan pre-COVID-19 adults were classified as responders by ELISPOT responses to spike-protein peptides, compared with 28% of Swedish pre-COVID-19 adults (p = 0.04). The frequencies for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific TNF- CD4+, TNF- CD8+ and IFN-{gamma} CD8+ T-cell responses, tended to be higher in the Kenyan adults although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Pre-COVID-19 T-cell responses could contribute to lower morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in SSA relative to Europe, Asia, and North America.">

        <tr id="The airway epithelium serves as a physical and immune barrier against inhaled insults. This tissue is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and following injury, the airway epithelium undergoes repair to restore barrier function. Though components of SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike glycoprotein essential in viral entry, have been shown to alter biological functions in various tissues, it is unclear how SARS-CoV-2 can impact airway epithelial functions, such as wound repair.In this study, 16HBE14o- epithelial monolayer cultures were treated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 subunit at 4 μg·mL−1or transfected with a plasmid expressing full-length spike glycoprotein. Secreted inflammatory mediators, markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest, culture proliferation, and wound closure measurements following mechanical injury were assessed.Spike treatment and transfection altered measures of culture proliferation and markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest. Secreted interleukin-6 but not interleukin-8 were significantly higher with spike S1 treatment, while both were significantly elevated with spike transfection. Wound closure was inhibited by both spike treatment and transfection, with significant reductions compared to control.SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 treatment and transfection can alter measures of proliferation, inflammation, and impair wound closure of 16HBE14o- airway epithelial cells. These results highlight how components of SARS-CoV-2 can impair functions of the airway epithelium independent of viral replication.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a significant challenge since the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared as an outbreak in March 2020, marked by diverse symptoms and prolonged duration of disease. Defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting or emerging for at least two months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection without an alternative cause, its prevalence varies globally, with estimates of 10–20% in Europe, 7.3% in the USA, and 3.0% in the UK. The condition’s etiology remains unclear, involving factors, such as renin–angiotensin system overactivation, persistent viral reservoirs, immune dysregulation, and autoantibodies. Reactivated viruses, like EBV and HSV-6, alongside epigenetic alterations, exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance. Emerging evidence links SARS-CoV-2 to chromatin and gut microbiome changes, further influencing long-term health impacts. Diagnosis of long COVID requires detailed systemic evaluation through medical history and physical examination. Management is highly individualized, focusing mainly on the patient’s symptoms and affected systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating diverse perspectives to address systemic manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Enhanced understanding of long COVID’s pathophysiology and clinical features is critical to improving patient outcomes and quality of life. With a growing number of cases expected globally, advancing research and disseminating knowledge on long COVID remain vital for developing effective diagnostic and management frameworks, ultimately supporting better care for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 provokes acute oxidative stress in the lungs via cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic factors, which might cause alveolar injury followed by severe respiratory syndrome during COVID-19 infection. The lack of particular antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 has opened novel avenues of complementary and alternative medicine as a potential remedy. The current study explored the mechanistic role of the ultradiluted formulation of Eupatorium (UDE) against SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S protein-mediated oxidative stress and mitochondriopathy. Methods: Cell line and BALB/c mice were used to report that SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused an inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm via the NF-κB pathway in the lung along with oxidative damage. Morphological examination was performed using DAPI staining and histology for treated cells and lung tissues of animals, respectively. The molecular mechanism of action of UDE was investigated through qRT-PCR for the genetic expressions of various cytokines, inflammatory, and apoptotic mediators; ELISA, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for the translational expression of the same molecules assayed for genetic expressions; and biochemical assays for various enzymes and ROS. Results: UDE treatment suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue-level oxidative stress and safeguarded mitochondrial integrity from free radical-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, UDE played a direct role in restoring cellular redox homeostasis and reducing the inflammatory response by suppressing NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1 expression, and ROS formation. Further, a plausible mechanism of action of UDE against S protein-induced damage was proposed. Conclusions: This study described a novel therapeutic approach against S protein-mediated hyperinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative damage. Hence, UDE may be considered as a prospective alternative to combat life-threatening consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the critical importance of understanding protective long-lasting immune responses. This study investigates the epitope specificity, T cell receptor (TCR) usage, and phenotypic changes in SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells over time in convalescent individuals with COVID-19. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 28 unvaccinated individuals with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (6 identified as the D614G variant, clade 20C) and analyzed up to 12 months post-symptom onset. Antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using specific dextramer and antibody reagents. TCR clonotypes and activation markers were characterized to explore T cell dynamics. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited waning frequencies long-term, transitioning from memory-like to a naïve-like state. scRNAseq revealed specificity against both spike and non-spike antigens with increased CD95 and CD127 expression over time, indicating that naïve-like T cells may represent stem cell memory T cells, which are multipotent and self-renewing, likely important for long-lived immunity. TCR clonal expansion was observed mainly in memory T cells, with overlapping TCR beta chain (TRB)-complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences between participants, suggesting shared public TCR epitope-specific repertoires against SARS-CoV-2. Further, unique spike-specific CD4+ T cells with high CD95 and CD127 expression were identified, which may play a crucial role in long-term protection. Discussion This study highlights epitope-specificity heterogeneity, with some immunodominant responses, and suggests a potential role for long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. Shared TCR repertoires offers insights into cross-reactive and protective T cell clones, providing valuable information for optimizing vaccine strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings underscore the critical role of cellular immunity in long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and emphasizes the importance of understanding T cell dynamics.">

        <tr id="Despite the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, there still remain risks of new aggressive strains of coronavirus. As the human population increases progressively, it is mandatory to ensure both preventive measures and an immediate response to emerging infectious threats. Another essential component for rapidly restraining a new possible pandemic is the development of new anticoronaviral therapeutics. In the present study, the anticoronaviral capabilities of Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) are characterized. It is demonstrated that the administration of GcMAF to Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the first phase of infection (six days postinfection) is accompanied by (i) a statistically significant reduction in the viral load of the lung tissue and (ii) the switching of the inflammatory status of the lung tissue to a neutral one in terms of mRNA expression levels of the groups of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The potential mechanism for this antiviral action and the containment of the inflammatory response by the drug associated with the engagement of terminal N-acetylgalactosamine GcMAF and C-type lectin domain containing 10A expressed at the surface of lung-infiltrating macrophages and pneumocytes, which simultaneously express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is discussed.">

        <tr id="Platelets, known for maintaining blood balance, also participate in antimicrobial defense. Upon severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, platelets become hyperactivated, releasing molecules such as cytokines, granule contents, and bioactive lipids. The key effector biolipids produced by platelets include 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), produced by 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), and prostaglandins and thromboxane, produced by cyclooxygenase-1. While prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 were previously associated with lung inflammation in severe COVID-19, the role of platelet 12-LOX in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using mice deficient for platelets' 12-LOX, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in higher lung inflammation characterized by histopathological tissue analysis, increased leukocyte infiltrates, and cytokine production relative to wild-type mice. In addition, distinct platelet and lung transcriptomic changes, including alterations in NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome-related gene expression, were observed. Mass spectrometry lipidomic analysis in 12-LOX-deficient-infected mice revealed significant changes in bioactive lipid content, including reduced levels of 12-HETrE that inversely correlated with disease severity. Finally, platelet 12-LOX deficiency was associated with increased morbidity and lower survival rates relative to wild type (WT) mice. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay between 12-LOX-related lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating severe outcomes, emphasizing the pivotal role of platelet enzymes in the host response to viral infections.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

        <tr id="The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly heterogeneous, with interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression playing a dual role in antiviral defense and immune dysregulation. To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.">

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a site of replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and GI symptoms are often reported by patients. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends upon heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which commensal bacteria that bathe the human mucosa are known to modify. To explore human gut HS-modifying bacterial abundances and how their presence may impact SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a task-based analysis of proteoglycan degradation on large-scale shotgun metagenomic data. We observed that gut bacteria with high predicted catabolic capacity for HS differ by age and sex, factors associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and directly by disease severity during/after infection, but do not vary between subjects with COVID-19 comorbidities or by diet. Gut commensal bacterial HS-modifying enzymes reduce spike protein binding and infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bacterial grooming of the GI mucosa may impact viral susceptibility.IMPORTANCESevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, can infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and individuals who exhibit GI symptoms often have more severe disease. The GI tract's glycocalyx, a component of the mucosa covering the large intestine, plays a key role in viral entry by binding SARS-CoV-2's spike protein via heparan sulfate (HS). Here, using metabolic task analysis of multiple large microbiome sequencing data sets of the human gut microbiome, we identify a key commensal human intestinal bacteria capable of grooming glycocalyx HS and modulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro. Moreover, we engineered the common probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection of human cell cultures. Understanding these microbial interactions could lead to better risk assessments and novel therapies targeting viral entry mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and nearly 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system.Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model. (A) Experimental diagram: Eight weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitored daily for symptoms, or euthanized at 5 days post-infection (DPI) to collect tissue.

(D) Representative mouse brain hemisphere image showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by immunohistochemical staining. Boxed regions are shown on the right. Bar: 500 µm. Methods Here using the K18-hACE2 model, we investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on major parts of neurovascular systems, and found increased incidence of microhemorrhage and significant disruption of both BBB and BCSFB in K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cerebral microvascular injury was accompanied by substantial pericyte damage, tight junction loss, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. In addition, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation occurred at both BBB and BCSFB, as shown by upregulation of VCAM-1 and COX2 markers.Figure 2: Vascular damage and BBB breakdown in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 model.

Results By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment.

Conclusion The impact of such changes, together with astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, may drive or at least contribute to the neurological complications seen in COVID-19 patients. As SARS-CoV-2 will likely remain a major health issue for years to come, our findings provide a needed understanding of its impact on the major CNS barriers and brain homeostasis at both molecular and cellular levels.

        <tr id="SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can lead to severe COVID‐19, particularly in elderly individuals and those with compromised immunity. Cellular senescence has been implicated as a key pathogenic mechanism. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of regorafenib, a previously characterized senomorphic drug, for severe COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 virus‐infected K18‐hACE2 mice, overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor, exhibited 100% mortality by 10 days post infection. Regorafenib treatment significantly improved survival rates, approximately 43% remaining alive. Mechanistically, regorafenib effectively suppressed type I and II interferon and cytokine signaling. Notably, regorafenib inhibited NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, a key driver of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID‐19. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of regorafenib and suggest its potential use as a promising treatment option for severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="The stability of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, especially concerning the cross-reactive recognition of the Omicron variant, remains incompletely characterized in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. This study evaluated humoral responses in 29 MM patients and cellular responses in a subset of 19 MM patients, specific to Wuhan and Omicron spike proteins, between 16 and 26 weeks following the third vaccine dose. After 26 weeks, we highlighted a significant reduction in the neutralizing antibodies to both spikes and the percentages of IFN-γ+CD107a+ spike-specific CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, patients who underwent an additional stimulation between the two time points, through either a fourth vaccine dose or breakthrough infection, showed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies and stable levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Additionally, those with only three doses experienced a higher rate of breakthrough infections during the 32-week follow-up period. These findings underscore the waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time and may help benefit-risk evaluation in vaccination strategies in MM patients.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is intricately related to the reprogramming of host metabolism. However, existing studies have mainly focused on peripheral blood samples and barely identified specific metabolites that are critically involved in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current small-scale study, we performed metabolic profiling in plasma (n = 61) and paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples (n = 20) using parallel two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS). In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-α production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that the levels of indoxyl sulfate could potentially serve as a functional biomarker to monitor COVID-19 disease progression and guide more individualized treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Alcohol-induced dysregulation of microglial activity is associated with neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, heightened risk for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol dependence, and escalation of alcohol drinking. Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes pulmonary edema, which disrupts the lung alveoli–capillary barrier and leads to pulmonary cell apoptosis, the main cause of death. However, the molecular mechanism behind SARS-CoV-2’s apoptotic activity remains unknown. Here, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a mediates the pulmonary pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is demonstrated by the fact that it causes lung tissue damage. The in vitro results showed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a triggers cell death via the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, which is modulated through the regulation of Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive Potassium Channel (MitoKATP). The addition of exogenous Potassium (K+) in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis along with the inflammatory interferon response (IFN-β) triggered by SARS-ORF-3a. The addition of exogenous K+ strongly suggests that dysregulation of K+ ion channel function is the central mechanism underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction and stress response induced by SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a. Our results designate that targeting the potassium channel or its interactions with ORF-3a may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the damaging effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID-19, which stands for Coronavirus Disease 2019, is caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and primarily manifests as a respiratory disease. However, the literature has reported its influence upon brain structure [1] and this observation finds additional support in the brain injury indicator, neurofilament light chain (NFL) [2]. Our NFL analysis in COVID-infected patients has indicated a correlation with the disease’ s severity. Nevertheless, the exact pathological pathway leading to brain neuronal injury remains elusive. Aims & Objectives In our prior analyses, we presented the findings on the NFL levels and their association with the syndrome observed in COVID-19-infected patients. In this study, we extended our investigation to include the examination of the oxidative stress indicator, D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) [3], in order to assess its correlation with NFL and its potential significance in COVID-infected patients. Method Plasma samples from 400 COVID-19 patients, drawn from 24 hospitals across Taiwan and sourced from the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) Biobank, were utilized for the analysis of DAO via immunoassay. The NFL data was incorporated from our previous investigation. Statistical analyses encompassed the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing two groups, Spearman's correlation analysis for assessing bivariate correlations. To address the distribution in plasma DAO and NFL levels, we applied log-transformation before subjecting them to the general linear model, with age and gender adjustment. Results Among the 391 COVID-infected patients analyzed, the average plasma DAO level was 136 ng/ml. Notably, the 10 patients exhibiting the most severe brain injury (NFL levels above 200 pg/ml) had a significantly higher average plasma DAO level of 568.2 ng/ml, in contrast to the group with less severe brain injury (NFL levels less than 200 pg.ml) composed of 381 patients, who had an average DAO level of 124.7 ng/ml (P=0.002). The DAO level displayed a significant correlation with the NFL level (Spearman’ s r=0.31, P<0.0001). Both the average NFL and DAO levels were significantly higher in patients over 50 years of age (P<0.0001, respectively), indicating a significant age-related trend. Male patients showed higher NFL and DAO levels than females (P=0.0002, and P<0.0001, respectively). The elevation in plasma NFL and DAO levels was most pronounced within the first 1-7 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed, subsequently declining over the course of a month. Additionally, the correlation between DAO and NFL levels became more pronounced in patients age 50 and above (Spearman’ s r=0.37, P=0.0001) compared to those under 50 years of age (Spearman’ s r=0.237, P<0.0001). Furthermore, the DAO level exhibited strong correlations with renal function indicators, specifically creatinine (Spearman’ s r=0.30, P=0.0002), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (Spearman’ s r=0.23, P=0.008). Discussion & Conclusion COVID-19 infection may lead to brain neuronal injury, particularly among male patients aged 50 and above. This neuronal injury exhibited a significant correlation with oxidative stress, as indicated by DAO. Furthermore, higher plasma DAO levels were associated with impaired kidney function, as indicated by elevated creatinine and BUN levels in clinical assessments. These results imply the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathological processes underlying brain neuronal injury.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, often leading to long-term kidney dysfunction. However, the transcriptomic features of AKI severity and its long-term effects are underexplored.


METHODS
We performed bulk RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and complemented these findings with proteomic data from the same cohort. We compared the functional enrichment findings with historical sepsis-AKI data and subsequently examined the association between molecular signatures and long-term kidney function changes.


RESULTS
In 283 patients, 57 had mild AKI (stage 1) and 49 had severe AKI (stage 2 or 3). Following adjustments for age, sex, severity of infection, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), we identified 6,432 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the severe AKI vs. control comparison, 840 in the mild AKI vs. control, and 1,213 in the severe vs. mild AKI comparison (FDR<0.05). Common pathways included unfolded protein response, cellular response to stress via eIF2, and IFN-g-mediated inflammatory response. Severe AKI was linked to pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Proteomic analysis confirmed 40 established AKI and inflammation biomarkers, while gene-set enrichment of transcription regulators revealed additional biomarkers for severe AKI. Comparison with PBMC transcriptomics from sepsis-related AKI showed significant functional overlap (30%). Analysis of post-discharge eGFR data in 115 patients identified 177 DEGs for severe vs. control, 106 for mild vs. control, and 46 for severe vs. mild AKI. Key associations included kidney function decline related to carbohydrate and mitochondrial metabolism, inflammatory-response, and cardiovascular regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that severe AKI in SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. The functional overlap with sepsis-AKI suggests potential broader therapeutic applicability. Long-term kidney dysfunction is influenced by disruptions in cellular energy metabolism and immune response.">

        <tr id="Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the infectious agent that causes coronavirus illness (COVID-19). The majority of virus-infected individuals will recover without the need for special care after experiencing mild-to-moderate respiratory symptoms. Some people, nevertheless, will get quite sick and need medical help. The choice of COVID-19 treatment should be made individually. The severity of the illness and the chance that it will worsen will determine the decision. Therefore, developing more potent medications is always a primary goal. Finding more effective drugs is a top priority. In this regard, natural animal toxins, such as toxin derived from scorpions, spiders, and wasps, have been found to include compounds that have significant therapeutic properties. Specifically, targeting the spike protein which acts as a gateway for the vires to enter the human or animal cells. Aim: This study focuses on the ability of toxins to destabilize the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: The active protein structure of the SARS-CoV-2, the toxins chosen obtained from the RCSB-protein data bank (PDB), and the molecular structures of toxins that were not proteins were either obtained from PubChem or downloaded as computer structure models from RCSB-PDB. Using molecular docking software such as “PyRx,” analyzers such as “BIOVIA-Discovery studios” and “Pymol,” and various techniques, the evaluation of the interactions between the spike protein and toxin was performed, to find possible pharmacophores that might serve as a foundation for upcoming medication development. The protein-ligand complex was put to test through the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation via visual molecular dynamics /nanoscale molecular dynamics application to determine the complex stability. Results: The current research findings reveal intriguing binding affinities and interaction patterns between the toxin and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, where the complex was identified to be stable throughout the study resembling the cellular conditions via MD simulations. We discuss the implications of these interactions and how they might interfere viral infection and entry. Conclusion: The current study sheds light on a promising avenue for the development of antiviral therapies, leveraging natural venoms as a source of inspiration for pharmacophore-based drug discovery opposing viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background/Aim Case reports describe prolonged COVID19 shedding in patients with malignant hematological disease. Similarly, we observed extended viral shedding in hemato-oncological patients (HP) at our SARS-CoV-2 unit. This raises the question of whether HP are more susceptible to prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and which aspects of immunosuppression contribute to this phenomenon. Patients and Methods Data from HP treated at a single center between 02/2022 and 02/2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, 47 HP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were included. Additional data on 16 HP were retrieved from literature. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (t[SARS+]) was compared between subgroups with different diagnoses, immune status, and HP with and without medical treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Results t[SARS+] of HP was 47 days [interquartile range (IR)=25-95] and 12 HP (19%) were still positive by the end of the follow-up. In our cohort, four HP died while still shedding SARS-CoV-2 [t[SARS+]=47 days (IR=33.5-86)]. Different oncological diagnoses did not influence t[SARS+]. HP under steroids had a significantly longer average t[SARS+] (108 days vs. 45 days; p=0.016). HP with B cell depletion/T cell depletion and leukopenia were found to require more time to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 (pLogrank <0.05). Vaccinated HP had a significantly shorter duration of viral shedding (vaccinated 35.5 days vs. not vaccinated 86 days; pLogrank <0.01). Conclusion Prolonged viral shedding is a common occurrence in HP. Our data illustrate that HP under immune suppression show a significantly longer t[SARS+]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vaccination influences the length of viral shedding.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Type I interferons exert their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including but not limited to LY6E, CH25H, IFITM2/3, and IFIH1. However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus’s receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2. These data provide new insights into the interplay between host innate antiviral immunity and SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on novel antiviral therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been identified as a critical host restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PLSCR1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry by downregulating the plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for viral entry. Our findings elucidate a novel host-pathogen interaction that not only deepens our understanding of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 but offers potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism implicated in cardiac infection in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 infection activates macrophages and induces the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Excess NETs is linked to inflammatory and thrombotic complications observed in COVID-19. Aim To explore the impact of NETs and macrophage activation on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who developed complications. Methods We included 30 patients from the first (March 2020) and 30 from the second wave (July 2021), collecting two plasma samples at diagnosis and seven days later. Data on demographics, comorbidities, and basic analytical data were compiled. NETs markers (myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), p-selectin (P-SEL) and S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer (MRP)) and macrophage activation markers (Chitotriosidase activity (ChT), CCL18/PARC and YKL-40) were measured. Results The first wave had higher incidences of post-COVID syndrome, ICU admissions, and mortality. Patients of each wave showed elevated blood cells, liver enzymes, and coagulation markers at the time of diagnosis, with fibrinogen and D-Dimer differing between waves. NET and macrophage markers, NE, MPO, MRP, DNAse, ChT, and CCL18 were elevated, while P-SEL, cfDNA, and YKL-40 were decreased if compared to controls. A decrease in NE and DNAse is a link to lower levels of these two markers in complications versus without complications. Conclusions This study emonstrates alterations in NETs and macrophage activation markers in COVID-19 patients, indicating an imbalance in inflammatory response regulation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Complement hyperactivation and thrombotic microangiopathy are closely associated with severe COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction is a key mechanism underlying thrombotic microangiopathy. To address the relationship between endothelial injury, complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy of severe COVID-19, we wonder whether, and if so, what and how SARS-CoV-2 factors make endothelial cells (ECs) sensitive to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. We revealed that multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins enhanced complement-mediated cytotoxicity to ECs by inhibiting membrane complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) and enhancing the deposition of complement-recognizing component FCN1. By screening with CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA libraries, we identified that ADAMTS9, SYAP1, and HIGD1A as intrinsic regulators of CD59 on ECs, which were inhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 M, NSP16, and ORF9b proteins. IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and IFN-α upregulated CD55 and CD59, while IFN-γ antagonized the inhibition of CD59 by the three SARS-CoV-2 proteins. So, the deficiency of IFN-γ weakened the protection of ECs by CRPs against complement-mediated injury which may be enhanced during infection. Our findings illustrated the regulation of protection against complement-mediated attack on self-cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune responses, providing insights into endothelial injury, thrombotic microangiopathy, and potential targets for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to an emerging health challenge known as long COVID, also known as PASC, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, characterized by symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of infection. While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background COVID‐19 has been associated with both respiratory (diaphragm) and non‐respiratory (limb) muscle atrophy. It is unclear if SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of skeletal muscle plays a role in these changes. This study sought to: 1) determine if cells comprising skeletal muscle tissue, particularly myofibres, express the molecular components required for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; 2) assess the capacity for direct SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and its impact on atrophy pathway genes in myogenic cells; and 3) in an animal model of COVID‐19, examine the relationship between viral infection of skeletal muscle and myofibre atrophy within the diaphragm and limb muscles. Methods We used in silico bioinformatics analysis of published human single cell RNA‐seq datasets, as well as direct qPCR examination of human myotubes and diaphragm biopsies, to assess expression of key genes involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 cellular entry. In Vitro, we determined the ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 to directly infect myogenic cells and employed qPCR to assess the impact on muscle atrophy pathway genes (ubiquitin‐proteasome, autophagy). In vivo, the diaphragm and quadriceps of Roborovski hamsters with SARS‐CoV‐2 respiratory infection were examined at day 3 post‐inoculation to evaluate the relationship between atrophy pathway and SARS‐CoV‐2 transcripts by qPCR, as well as histological measurements of myofibre morphology. Results Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as cooperating proteases (furin, cathepsins B and L), are expressed by myofibres. ACE2 expression was increased 5‐fold (p = 0.01) in the diaphragms of mechanically ventilated human subjects compared to controls. In Vitro, a time‐dependent increase of SARS‐CoV‐2 transcript levels was observed in myotubes directly exposed to the virus (p = 0.002). This was associated with downregulation of the ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (by 64%, p = 0.002) and the autophagy gene LC3B (by 31%, p = 0.009). In contrast, in vivo infection led to upregulation of MuRF1 in quadriceps (23‐fold, p = 0.0007) and autophagy genes in both quadriceps (5.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 7‐fold for p62, p = 0.0002) and diaphragm (2.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 2.3‐fold for p62, p = 0.057). In infected hamsters the diaphragm lacked viral transcripts but exhibited atrophy (48% decrease in myofibre area; p = 0.02), whereas the quadriceps lacked myofibre atrophy despite elevated viral transcripts in the muscle. Conclusions Although myogenic cells express the genes required for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and can be directly infected, there was no evident relationship between viral transcript levels and manifestations of atrophy, either in vitro or in vivo. Our results do not support direct myofibre infection by SARS‐CoV‐2 as a likely cause of atrophy in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="T-cell-mediated immunity is essential for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection, preventing severe disease, and potentially reducing the risk of long-term coronavirus disease (COVID). This study investigated the impact of natural infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity on T-cell responses, with a particular emphasis on the role of memory T-cells in long-term COVID-19. The present study reviewed current literature on T-cell responses, including memory T-cell development, in individuals with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, those vaccinated with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and those with hybrid immunity. It examined studies that compared T-cell activity, immune regulation, and the prevalence of long-term COVID-19 across these groups. Natural infection induces variable T-cell responses, with severe cases showing stronger but sometimes dysregulated immunological activity, which may contribute to prolonged COVID-19. Vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines, elicits targeted and consistent T-cell responses, including memory T-cells, reducing disease severity, and the incidence of long-term COVID-19. Hybrid immunity combines natural infection and vaccination, provides the most robust protection, enhanceds memory T-cell responses, and reduces the risk of long-term COVID-19 through balanced immune regulation. Memory T-cells play a critical role in mitigating long-term COVID-19. Vaccination significantly enhances T-cell-mediated immunity, minimizing the risk of chronic symptoms compared to natural infection alone. Hybrid immunity provides the most effective defense, emphasizing the importance of vaccination, even after natural infection, to prevent long-term COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="Introduction Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality, especially in COVID-19 patients, due to delayed diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. While the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) in COVID-19 and sepsis are complex, understanding the molecular markers involved in these processes may aid in assessing disease severity. This study aimed to investigate the roles of PCD markers, inflammatory cytokines, and MHC molecules in distinguishing disease severity in COVID-19 patients with and without sepsis. Methods The study involved adult patients (≥18 years) who survived COVID-19, grouped into four cohorts: COVID-19 with sepsis (C19wSepsis), COVID-19 without sepsis (C19NoSepsis), sepsis alone, and healthy controls. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each cohort were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. PCD markers (caspase-3, caspase-1, MLKL, LC3B, p62/SQSTM1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma), and MHC molecules (MHC I-A, MHC II-DRB1) were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences in marker levels between and within cohorts. Results The analysis identified two distinct molecular signatures associated with disease severity. The first signature, characterized by elevated levels of secreted markers of PCD, IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma, MHC I-A and MHC II-DRB1, was common to the C19wSepsis and C19NoSepsis cohorts. The second signature, which was more prominent in the cellular markers of PCD (caspase-1, caspase-3, MLKL, p62/SQSTM1), was uniquely associated with the C19wSepsis cohort. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the molecular signatures distinguishing immune responses in COVID-19-related sepsis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, while guiding therapeutic interventions in critical care settings.">

MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiology of viral diseases is complex, and often evokes strong inflammatory responses and tissue damage. Currently available in vitro models mainly recapitulate the viral life cycle per se, but fail to model immune cell-mediated pathogenesis. Here we build macrophage-augmented organoids (MaugOs) by integrating macrophages into organoids that are cultured from human liver tissues. We test the infections of two RNA viruses, hepatitis E virus (HEV) and SARS-CoV-2, and one DNA virus, monkeypox virus (MPXV), which either primarily or secondarily affect the human liver. In all three viral disease modalities, MaugOs recapitulate both infection and the resulting inflammatory response, albert to different levels. Intriguingly, this system showcases the ability to dissect the multifunctional role of human bile on HEV replication and inflammatory response through distinct mechanisms of action. MaugOs especially when integrated with pro-inflammatory macrophages recapitulate a prominent feature of inflammatory cell death triggered by HEV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept in MaugOs to develop multitarget therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target the virus, inflammatory response, and the resultant inflammatory cell death.">

Mouse models are still one of the most-interrogated experimental systems with the caveat of biological differences in pathogen-host-interaction for some human-relevant pathogens and increasing ethical concerns. Arguably one of the most complex cell culture models are precision cut organ slices, volume defined tissue blocks which can be cultured ex vivo and exposed to various stimuli including human pathogens. They could be applied as 3R model system. However, their response to infectious agents in comparison to in vivo models is understudied. To understand species and model specific differences in the host response (here: influenza A virus (IAV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)), we interrogate here the transcriptional reaction of human PCLS (hPCLS) compared to that of murine precision cut lung slices (mPCLS) and a murine in vivo infection model. A direct comparison of hPCLS and mPCLS revealed a more complex early innate immune response against viral and bacterial pathogens in the human model, which beyond this informs about secondary cell-to-cell communication in situ and bystander cell responses to proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines secreted by tissue resident immune cells. In contrast, the murine PCLS model revealed substantial deficits in responding to viral challenge, reproducing only a small fraction of the murine in vivo host response. Our study provides the first cross-species comparison of early transcriptomic responses to relevant human pathogens.">

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cause significant dysfunction among people living with HIV. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of treatment options have been evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials, with several being approved for use in humans. Immunomodulatory drugs have shown success in dampening the deleterious inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 patients, but there remains an urgent need for development of additional therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. A potential drug target is the CCR5-CCL5 axis, and blocking this pathway may protect against severe disease. Here we evaluated whether OB-002, an analog of human CCL5 and a potent antagonist of CCR5, provides therapeutic benefit in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Daily treatment with OB-002 altered immune gene transcription in the lungs, and reduced pathology following infection, but did not prevent weight loss or viral replication in the lungs of infected animals, even in combination with the antiviral drug remdesivir. Our data suggest that targeting the CCR5-CCL5 pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters is insufficient to significantly impact disease development in this model.">

Red dot: overexpression, blue dot: underexpression, white/empty space no difference vs controls Methods Multicenter observational study of SARS-CoV-2-infected and/or vaccinated pregnant people and their infants. Pregnant people (infected [n=91], vaccinated [n=42], infected-and-vaccinated [n=14], controls [n=22]) and their infants (n=81, 38,14, 11, respectively) were included. Maternal blood samples were collected during different trimesters and at delivery. Infant blood samples were collected longitudinally from birth (< 72 hours), at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months of age. Whole blood RNA was extracted for RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data analyzed with R Transcriptional analysis of immune system development in early life Modular gene expression scores were analyzed longitudinally of individual infant samples. Red: higher expression, white: lower expression. D1-3: days 1 to 3, W1: week 1, M1: month 1, M3: month 3, M6: month 6 Results Compared with uninfected controls, interferon and plasma cells genes were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute infection (< 14 days), but underexpressed with earlier infection or vaccination during pregnancy (Figure 1). Newborns < 72 h of age (from all groups) showed significantly increased expression of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and inflammation genes. Expression of T/cytotoxic cell genes started to be observed at 1 week, while expression of B cells, plasma cells and interferon genes was observed at 3 months of age (Figure 2). Quantitative gene set enrichment analysis showed that compared to controls, infants from infected and/or vaccinated mothers had increased expression of interferon, while neutrophil, and adaptive immunity genes were decreased (Figure 3) SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination of pregnant people shaped immune profiles of their infants Fold changes of gene sets in infants compared to controls are shown (adjusted p-value <0.01) from quantitative gene set enrichment (QuSAGE) analysis. Red: overexpression, blue: underexpression. Infant groups are defined by maternal infection and/or vaccination status at delivery. Conclusion Interferon and plasma cells related pathways were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute COVID-19, while vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier in pregnancy were associated with under-expression of both innate and adaptive immunity genes. The infant immune system changed rapidly in the first few days of life, as different immune programs followed separate time trajectories.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelination and neuroinflammation, with oxidative stress playing a pivotal role in lesion pathology. This study aimed to investigate the differential cellular responses to myelin debris under varying oxidative states. Myelin oxidation was induced using a Cu–peroxide system, confirmed by elevated TBARS levels and autofluorescence. BV-2 microglia viability remained unaffected by myelin exposure. However, oxidized myelin significantly altered oxidative stress markers, autophagy, and iron metabolism, as evidenced by changes in Sod2, Tfr1, p62, and P-Erk/Erk ratios. Morphological analyses revealed time- and dose-dependent differences in myelin processing, with oxidized myelin leading to distinct phagosome dynamics. Complementary studies using induced microglia-like cells (iMG)—a primary cell culture—confirmed the feasibility of employing oxidized microglia to study microglia activity. The use of iMGs provides a model closer to patient physiology, offering the potential to evaluate individual cellular responses to oxidative damage. This approach could be instrumental in identifying personalized therapeutic strategies by assessing patient-specific microglial behavior in response to myelin debris. These findings highlight the impact of myelin oxidative status on microglial function, advancing the understanding of oxidative stress in MS and paving the way for personalized medicine applications in neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Haemophilus ducreyi causes the genital ulcer disease chancroid and cutaneous ulcers in children. To study its pathogenesis, we developed a human challenge model in which we infect the skin on the upper arm of human volunteers with H. ducreyi to the pustular stage of disease. The model has been used to define lesional architecture, describe the immune infiltrate into the infected sites using flow cytometry, and explore the molecular basis of the immune response using bulk RNA-seq. Here, we used single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to simultaneously characterize multiple cell types within infected human skin and determine the cellular origin of differentially expressed transcripts that we had previously identified by bulk RNA-seq. We obtained paired biopsies of pustules and wounded (mock infected) sites from five volunteers for scRNA-seq. We identified 13 major cell types, including T- and NK-like cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, as well as other cell types typically found in the skin. Immune cell types were enriched in pustules, and some subtypes within the major cell types were exclusive to pustules. Sufficient tissue specimens for spatial transcriptomics were available from four of the volunteers. T- and NK-like cells were highly associated with multiple antigen presentation cell types. In pustules, type I interferon stimulation was high in areas that were high in antigen presentation—especially in macrophages near the abscess—compared to wounds. Together, our data provide a high-resolution view of the cellular immune response to the infection of the skin with a human pathogen. IMPORTANCE A high-resolution view of the immune infiltrate due to infection with an extracellular bacterial pathogen in human skin has not yet been defined. Here, we used the human skin pathogen Haemophilus ducreyi in a human challenge model to identify on a single cell level the types of cells that are present in volunteers who fail to spontaneously clear infection and form pustules. We identified 13 major cell types. Immune cells and immune-activated stromal cells were enriched in pustules compared to wounded (mock infected) sites. Pustules formed despite the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and type I interferon. Interferon stimulation was most evident in macrophages, which were proximal to the abscess. The pro-inflammatory response within the pustule may be tempered by regulatory T cells and cells that express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, leading to failure of the immune system to clear H. ducreyi.">

        <tr id="Human milk-derived extracellular vesicles (HMEVs) are key components in breast milk, promoting infant health and development. Maternal conditions could affect HMEV cargo; however, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HMEVs remains unknown. This study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on postpartum HMEV molecules. The median duration from SARS-CoV-2 test positivity to milk collection was 3 months. After defatting and casein micelle disaggregation, HMEVs were isolated from milk samples of nine mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 and six controls by sequential centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and qEV-size exclusion chromatography. The presence of HMEV was confirmed via transmission electron microscopy. Nanoparticle tracking analysis demonstrated particle diameters of <200 nm and yields of >1 × 1011 particles per mL of milk. Western immunoblots detected ALIX, CD9, and HSP70, supporting the presence of HMEVs in the isolates. Cargo from thousands of HMEVs were analyzed using a multi-omics approach, including proteomics and microRNA sequencing, and predicted that mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection produced HMEVs with enhanced functionalities involving metabolic reprogramming, mucosal tissue development, and immunomodulation. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy boosts mucosal site-specific functions of HMEVs, potentially protecting infants against viral infections. Further prospective studies should be pursued to reevaluate the short- and long-term benefits of breastfeeding in the post-COVID era.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Glia antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) are pivotal regulators of immune surveillance within the retina, maintaining tissue homeostasis and promptly responding to insults. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying their local coordination and activation remain unclear. Our study integrates an animal model of retinal injury, retrospective analysis of human retinas, and in vitro experiments to gain insights into the crucial role of antigen presentation in neuroimmunology during retinal degeneration (RD), uncovering the involvement of various glial cells, notably Müller glia and microglia. Glial cells act as sentinels, detecting antigens released during degeneration and interacting with T‐cells via MHC molecules, which are essential for immune responses. Microglia function as APCs via the MHC Class II pathway, upregulating key molecules such as Csf1r and cytokines. In contrast, Müller cells act through the MHC Class I pathway, exhibiting upregulated antigen processing genes and promoting a CD8+ T‐cell response. Distinct cytokine signaling pathways, including TNF‐α and IFN Type I, contribute to the immune balance. Human retinal specimens corroborate these findings, demonstrating glial activation and MHC expression correlating with degenerative changes. In vitro assays also confirmed differential T‐cell migration responses to activated microglia and Müller cells, highlighting their role in shaping the immune milieu within the retina. In summary, our study emphasizes the involvement of retinal glial cells in modulating the immune response after insults to the retinal parenchyma. Unraveling the intricacies of glia‐mediated antigen presentation in RD is essential for developing precise therapeutic interventions for retinal pathologies.">

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 is believed to cause cytopathic effects in forming multinucleated cells, known as syncytia. Syncytia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection found in lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients represents a case of COVID-19 with a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is very important to study the mechanism of syncytia formation and to test candidate materials that can inhibit the occurrence of syncytia and potentially be applied in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Since syncytia counting and analysis are time-consuming, we utilized a high-content screening (HCS) instrument in this study to automate syncytia analysis. We used 293T cells transfected with plasmids to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), and a plasmid encoding lifeact-GFP as an F-actin biosensor to facilitate syncytia analysis using the HCS instrument. In this study, syncytia analysis was carried out using HCS software. The HCS application categorizes cells as multi-nuclei by counting the number of cell nuclei stained with DAPI in cells that emitted green fluorescence due to lifeact-GFP expression. Syncytia analysis is time-consuming because of the calculation of the number of syncytia formed in a confluent cell monolayer culture. Hopefully, utilizing the HCS platform can accelerate the test of syncytia inhibition after various treatments using test compounds.Keywords: 293T cells, high-content analysis, SARS-CoV-2, spike, syncytia.">

        <tr id="The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the significance of viral infections, affecting billions of lives and costing trillions of dollars globally. Even beyond SARS-CoV-2, common infections with viruses like influenza, HIV, and herpesviruses have profound impacts beyond their typical manifestations, often triggering acute and chronic pain syndromes that can be life-altering. These virally induced pain states can arise through direct viral replication within neurons, or indirectly, via immune responses to infection in both the contexts of afferent signaling in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) or subsequent higher order integration in intracranial systems. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2 each provide a unique lens through which to examine the interplay between viral activity and pain. This perspective paper is not meant to be an exhaustive review of virally-induced neuropathic pain states. It seeks to explore curated aspects of the complexities of these pain states, identify research gaps, and suggest solutions using nanoscale molecular understanding and psychoneuroimmunological and biopsychosocial frameworks. Each subheading is accompanied by a list of related issues for study which we think will lead to advances in our understanding of the vexing pain phenotype associated with viral infection.">

        <tr id="CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. While most infected people experienced mild illness, others progressed to severe disease, characterized by hyperinflammation and respiratory distress. There is still much to learn about the innate immune response to this virus. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor that is activated when pattern recognition receptors detect viruses. Upon activation, IRF3 induces the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated genes, which protect the host from viral infection. However, coronaviruses antagonize this pathway, delaying type 1 IFN production. It is, therefore, unclear how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. Our prior reports showed that IRF3 promotes harmful inflammation during bacterial sepsis in mice. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that IRF3 cannot effectively control the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and instead promotes harmful inflammation during severe COVID-19. METHODS AND MODELS: We used mice transgenic for the human angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 transgene, driven by the keratin 18 promoter (K18-ACE2 mice) that were IRF3 deficient or IRF3 sufficient to test how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, K18-ACE2 mice showed a dose-dependent disease, characterized by mortality, lethargy, weight loss, and lung pathology, reminiscent of clinical COVID-19. However, K18-ACE2 mice lacking IRF3 were protected from severe disease with reduced mortality (84.6% vs. 100%) and disease score. We found that IRF3 promoted IFN-β production in the lungs and reprogrammed the cytokine profile, while viral load in the lungs was similar in the presence or absence of IRF3. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that IRF3 played a detrimental role in murine COVID-19 associated with changes in IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The majority of COVID-19 infections in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological (Heme-Onc) diagnoses are mild with good outcome compared to adults. Postulated reasons include cross-protection from immunity against seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV’s), subdued inflammatory responses in children than in adults and differences in humoral and T-cell responses. The objectives of this study are to compare antibody responses against HCoV’s, anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral, T-cell, and inflammatory profiles between Heme-Onc children with COVID-19 and control groups. Methods Binding IgG antibodies against Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2, four HCoV’s (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), quantitative levels of 21 cytokines and 9 chemokines (multiplexed solid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay by Meso Scale Diagnostics/MSD) were compared among five cohorts: 1) children with Heme-Onc diagnoses and COVID-19 (n = 41) 2) healthy children with COVID-19 (n = 21) 3) adults with COVID-19 (n = 14) 4) children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [n = 23] and 5) healthy children without COVID-19 (n = 12). Additionally, T-cell responses against S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using ELISpot in Heme-Onc children a group of healthy children COVID-19. Results Anti-S antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV were significantly lower in children in Heme-Onc and healthy children with COVID-19 compared to adults with COVID-19 (Figure 1). The concentration of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in Heme-Onc and healthy children compared to adults with COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. The responder T-cell frequency varied between 0 and 860/100,000 PBMC at study enrollment in children with Heme-Onc diagnoses. Conclusion In this single-center study, cross-protection from HCoV antibodies is an unlikely mechanism to explain mild COVID-19 in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological diagnoses. Subdued inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be one of the factors for the mild COVID-19 disease phenotype in children.

        <tr id="Monocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in surveillance and homeostasis, and can exacerbate pathogenic processes during injury, infection, or inflammation. CD14+CD16+ monocytes exhibit diverse functions and contribute to neuroinflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI). Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Thus, Group 1 cells within the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset are likely to be major contributors to neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector β-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of β-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that β-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of β-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, β-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that β-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a plethora of long-COVID symptoms for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe symptoms, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. Methods: This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Results: Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group who previously exhibited different symptoms (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered groups, significantly elevated in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. Following vaccination, the recovered group who experienced disease history showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p<0.005). Notably, antibody titers are negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p<0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days of two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, the titers were comparable to the baseline titer, indicating the importance of vaccination and booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infectious history. To ensure long-term respiratory health, this study emphasizes the significance of evaluating pulmonary function in those who might have contained asymptomatic COVID-19 infections as well as those who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, these findings underscore the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history as a key strategy in pandemic preparedness. Conclusions: To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="The current lack of a straightforward and convenient modeling approach to simulate the onset of acute lung injury (ALI) has impeded fundamental research and hindered the screening of therapeutic drugs in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The co-cultured human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpics) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) were exposed to the complete medium, three concentrations of recombinant spike S1 protein (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/mL), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 μg/mL). The cells were harvested at 1, 2, and 3 days post-exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and IL-6, TNF-ɑ, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production were quantified and compared. Compared to those exposed to medium, co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs exposed to a concentration of S1 protein at 10 μg/mL demonstrated significantly increased levels of LDH release (22.9% vs. 9.1%, and 25.7%), IL-6 (129 vs. 74, and 110 pg/mg of protein), and TNF-ɑ (75 vs. 51, and 86 pg/mg of protein) production, and similar to those exposed to LPS. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in MDA production. Compared to those harvested at 1 or 2 days post-exposure, co-cultured cells harvested at 3 days post-exposure exhibited increased levels of LDH release (23.4% vs. 14.9%, or 16.7%), IL-6 (127 vs. 81, or 97 pg/mg of protein) and MDA (5.6 vs. 3.2, or 3.8 nmol/mg of protein) production, but exhibited lower TNF-ɑ (58 vs. 79 pg/mg of protein) production than those harvested at 2 days post-exposure. After 3 days of exposure, co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs showed significantly increased levels of LDH release (25.3% vs. 18.4%), and MDA production (5.5 vs. 4.3 nmol/mg of protein) compared to HPAEpics monocultures, and increased levels of LDH release (25.3% vs. 13.8%), IL-6 (139 vs. 98 pg/mg of protein) and MDA (5.5 vs. 4.7 nmol/mg of protein) production, and decreased TNF-ɑ (59 vs. 95 pg/mg of protein) production compared to AMs monocultures. Conclusions: The exposure to a concentration of S1 protein at 10 μg/mL in co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs induced significant injury and inflammation three days post-exposure. This methodology for establishing a COVID-19-associated ALI model may have promising potential applications and value.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is a complex and multifaceted clinical challenge requiring to emphasize its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This study assessed hundreds of virological, serological, immunological, and tissue damage biomarkers in two patient cohorts who experienced mild (n=270) or severe (n=188) COVID-19, 6 to 9 months post-initial infection, and in which 40% and 57.4% of patients, respectively, developed PASC. Blood analysis showed that mains differences observed in humoral, viral, and biological biomarkers were associated with the initial COVID-19 severity, rather than being specifically linked to PASC. However, patients with PASC displayed altered CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell subsets, with higher cytokine-secreting cells and increased terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector memory T cells (TEMRA). Elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells responsive to nucleocapsid/membrane proteins with a TEMRA phenotype were also observed. A random forest model identified these features and initial symptom duration as top variables discriminating PASC, achieving over 80% classification accuracy. Highlights Nine months post-initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, over 40% of patients developed PASC Regardless of PASC, the initial disease form influenced the main immune differences PASC led to altered memory T-cell subsets with elevated TEMRA phenotype PASC presence is associated with disease form, initial symptom count and duration">

        <tr id="Introduction Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing immune responses against pathogens. The fluctuation of Treg proportions in COVID-19 remains a topic of debate, and the mechanisms triggering Treg activation in COVID-19 are still unclear. Understanding these issues is essential for better managing immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Methods We collected a cohort of COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and stage to explore the transcriptomic and functional traits of Tregs in these individuals. Using transcriptomic analysis, we evaluated the proportion and functionality of different Treg subsets, specifically HLA_DR+ Tregs, across different stages of COVID-19 patients. Results Our analysis revealed that the proportion of CCR7 + Tregs decreased as the disease advanced, while the cell proportion of HLA_DR+ regs escalated with the severity of the disease. Moreover, the transcription actor CARHSP1 exhibited apositive correlation with the proportion of HLA_DR+ Tregs. Notably, the heightened suppressive function of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients, with interactions between PF4 and CXCR3, contributed to the homeostasis of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that Tregs in COVID-19 patients exhibited weakened TCR clonotype expansion, and the suppression of HLA_DR+ Tregs with expanded TCR clonotypes in severe COVID-19 cases did not show a significant increase compared to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 groups. The findings indicate that Tregs may be activated through the bystander effect, as evidenced by the analysis of TCR clonotype characteristics. Discussion Our research delineates the diversity of dynamic alterations in Tregs and sheds light on potential mechanisms underlying Treg activation, providing a theoretical foundation and offering treatment strategies for managing COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several cardiovascular complications, including myocarditis, which can be a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause cardiac muscle inflammation through direct mechanisms, such as viral invasion of myocardial cells, and indirect mechanisms, such as the systemic inflammatory response. Myocarditis can lead to life-threatening electrical dysfunctions and arrhythmias. Although post-infection myocarditis is more common, rare cases of post-vaccination myocarditis have also been reported, especially with mRNA vaccines. However, these post-vaccination cases tend to be mild and self-limiting, with a good response to treatment. Despite the associated risks, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections and related heart complications. It is crucial to continue surveillance and research to better understand the association between COVID-19, myocarditis and sudden cardiac death in the young and improve prevention and intervention strategies. In this literature review, we analyzed the pathogenetic mechanisms and histological features of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 and its vaccination, and focused on the correlation with sudden cardiac death.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of human activity worldwide, frequently resulting in post-acute sequelae and affecting multiple organ systems. The underlying mechanisms driving both acute and post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 are still poorly understood, warranting further investigation for new targets. The study represents the first attempt to explore the role of T-cadherin in COVID-19 pathogenesis as well as its implications in pulmonary fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. First, we revealed a significant decrease in T-cadherin expression in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19 patients. This downregulated T-cadherin expression correlated with the elevated levels of VE-cadherin and reduced levels of β-catenin, suggesting a disruption in endothelial cell-cell contact integrity and function. Second, the reciprocal relation of T-cadherin and VE-cadherin expression was further confirmed using cultured human endothelial Ea.hy926 cells. T-cadherin overexpression caused a decrease in VE-cadherin mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells providing additional evidence in favor of their interplay. Third, employing Cdh13 −/− mice, we unveiled the protective role of T-cadherin deficiency against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fourth, we demonstrated the mice lacking T-cadherin to have downregulated reactive oxygen species production and Nox2 mRNA expression in an angiotensin II-mediated endothelial dysfunction model. Our findings provide rationale for further studies into T-cadherin-mediated mechanisms in these processes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Etiology remains elusive for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), and no treatment exists. Antivirals had no efficacy in randomized clinical trials (RCT) for Epstein-Barr Virus and HHV-6. Enteroviruses (EV) have been implicated, but no antivirals are available. Many patients who received SARS–CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs for acute Covid-19 (COV19) infection experienced significant improvement of prior ME/CFS symptoms. This study summarizes their responses to antivirals for SARS-Cov-2. Methods Neutralizing Antibody (NA) for Coxsackievirus B (CVB)1-6 and Echovirus 6, 7, 9, 11, 30 were done by ARUP lab. Enterovirus Protein (EVP) of Peripheral Blood Leukocytes (PBL) was determined by Western Blot. ME/CFS patients fulfilled Canadian consensus criteria, and had either elevated NA for enteroviruses and/or positive EVP in PBL. ME/CFS patients hospitalized for acute COV19 infection and patients without COV19, were given 5-10 days of IV Remdesivir (Rem) +/- immune modulators. Controls: 20 ME/CFS patients seen concurrently without Remdesivir treatment. Other ME/CFS patients (non-COV19) were given Nirmaltrelvir/Ritonavir (PAX) daily for 10 days +/- one repeat. The energy index (EI) was monitored by the patients before, during and after treatment. Significant improvement was defined as > 30%. Results 15/20 (75%) ME/CFS patients – 10/12 hospitalized, 5/8 non-COV19 patients – responded to IV Rem 2-6 weeks after infusions; remission lasted 6-8 weeks to 6-9 months before relapse. Of Controls: 2/20 had mild improvement (< 0.001, X 2 ). 104/200 (52%) of PAX-treated ME/CFS patients improved, often within 2-3 days; all relapsed within days to weeks after treatment. 66%, 33% and 44% of CVB4+, CVB3+, non-CVB3,4+ patients responded to treatment, respectively. EVP decreased and increased with clinical response and relapse. Conclusion Rem and PAX demonstrated clinical efficacy in ME/CFS patients with chronic enterovirus infections. Placebo-controlled RCT will be needed to clarify the role of antivirals in ME/CFS. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions—the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum—enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bacteria exhibit distinct behaviors in laboratory settings compared to infection environments. The presence of host cells induces changes in bacterial activity, while pathogens trigger immune responses that shape the microenvironment. Studying infection dynamics by microscopy, cytokine screening, and dual RNA sequencing in an air–liquid interface model, we found that prolonged Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization of airway epithelium led to a pro-inflammatory response, consistent across P. aeruginosa strains, despite differences in the dynamics of this response. Concurrently, P. aeruginosa formed non-attached aggregates on the apical side of the cell layer and upregulated genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence. Notably, there was remarkable resemblance between the P. aeruginosa transcriptional profile in our model and that previously reported upon host cell contact. Developing a platform that replicates host microenvironments is vital not only for gaining deeper insights into the interplay between host and pathogen but also for evaluating therapeutic strategies in conditions that closely mirror clinical environments.">

        <tr id="Vesiculovirus carajas (CARV) is a pathogen with neuroinvasive potential, yet its impact on neuroinflammation and sickness behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuropathological and immunological responses to CARV encephalitis in adult BALB/c mice. Mice were intranasally inoculated with either infected or uninfected brain homogenates, and clinical, histopathological, and cytokine profiles were analyzed. CARV antigens were primarily detected in necrotic neurons, with prominent microglial activation near the ventricles and blood vessels. By day 10 post-infection, infected mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of MCP-1, IFN-γ, IL-12 p70, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in the brain, indicating a strong inflammatory response. These findings highlight the inflammatory modulation associated with CARV infection and suggest a hematogenous route of neuroinvasion, distinguishing CARV from other vesiculovirus species. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of CARV encephalitis and its potential impact on neuroimmune dynamics.">

Being critical to CNS homeostasis, microglia also have been shown to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancer. Hence, microglia are regarded as a potential therapeutic target in CNS diseases, resulting in an increased demand for reliable in vitro models. Two human microglia cell lines (HMC3 and C20) are being used in multiple in vitro studies, however, the knowledge of their biological and immunological characteristics remains limited. Our aim was to identify and compare the biological changes in these immortalised immune cells under normal physiological and immunologically challenged conditions. Using high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, we have examined in-depth proteomic profiles of non-stimulated and LPS or IFN-γ challenged HMC3 and C20 cells. Our findings reveal that HMC3 cells responded to both treatments through upregulation of immune, metabolic, and antiviral pathways, while C20 cells showed a response associated with mitochondrial and immune activities. Additionally, the secretome analysis demonstrated that both cell lines release IL-6 in response to LPS, while IFN-γ treatment resulted in altered kynurenine pathway activity, highlighting distinct immune and metabolic adaptations.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bats are reservoirs for multiple viruses, some of which are known to cause global disease outbreaks. Virus spillovers from bats have been implicated in zoonotic transmission. Some bat species can tolerate viral infections, such as infections with coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses, better than humans and with less clinical consequences. Bat species are speculated to have evolved alongside these viral pathogens, and adaptations within the bat immune system are considered to be associated with viral tolerance. Inflammation and cell death in response to zoonotic virus infections prime human immunopathology. Unlike humans, bats have evolved adaptations to mitigate virus infection-induced inflammation. Inflammatory cell death pathways such as necroptosis and pyroptosis are associated with immunopathology during virus infections, but their regulation in bats remains understudied. This review focuses on the regulation of inflammation and cell death pathways in bats. We also provide a perspective on the possible contribution of cell death-regulating proteins, such as caspases and gasdermins, in modulating tissue damage and inflammation in bats. Understanding the role of these adaptations in bat immune responses can provide valuable insights for managing future disease outbreaks, addressing human disease severity, and improving pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected individuals showed either mild symptoms or were paucisymptomatic, with severe impact on human health, revealing heightened risk and direct effects on health. Among various factors contributing to complications, bacterial and fungal co-infection remains very common and is highly lethal. This narrative review aims to focus on the collective role of gut microbiota and mycobiota in COVID-19. Fungal infection has been identified as a key risk factor for the spread of COVID-19 and mortality. Gut mycobiomes diversity and abundance also vary due to the different types of SARS-CoV-2 variant infection. Their cross-talk plays a vital role in immune regulation and disease severity, with an emphasis on understanding the altered condition as a predictive marker. On the other hand, the gut microbiome is well known for shaping metabolic functions, generating immune responses, and deciphering the signal to decide the healthy state and disease condition of an individual. Immune response during COVID-19 infection was also linked with metabolites produced by the gut microflora, specifically amino acids, sugar metabolites, and neurotransmitters. The cross-talk between gut microbiota and gut mycobiota for clinical implications in terms of early detection, identification of the disease severity, and even therapeutic alternatives will open newer avenues. A deep dive understanding of the cross-talk between the microbiome and mycobiome, and their role in immune response will take scientific discovery knowledge to develop gut-targeted safe therapeutic approaches in the form of FMT (fecal microbiota transplantation) probiotics, peptides, antibacterial, and antifungal metabolites. Overall cross-talk and immune interplay are critical determinants of host immunity, providing insights into their role and key take home lessons for better management of crisis in the future.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The pathogenesis of Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) following mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 3–6% of people suffer from post-COVID condition or syndrome (PCS). A subset meets the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA can persist after acute infection in serum or tissues, but their role in PCS is unclear. Methods: Here, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analyzed in the serum of 121 PCS patients with predominant fatigue and exertional intolerance, of whom 72 met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, 37 post-COVID recovered healthy controls, and 32 pre-pandemic healthy controls. Results: Spike protein was detected in the serum of 11% of recovered controls, 2% of PCS patients, and 14% of ME/CFS patients between 4 and 31 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not in pre-pandemic samples. The occurrence and concentration of spike protein did not correlate with infection or vaccination timepoints. In ME/CFS patients, spike protein presence was not associated with the severity of symptoms or functional disability. In 5 out of 22 patients who under-went immunoglobulin depletion, spike protein levels were reduced or undetectable after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. Conclusions: In summary, this study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients but found no association with ME/CFS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunosenescence, age‐related immune dysregulation, reduces immunity upon vaccinations and infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection results in declining naïve (Tnaïve) and increasing terminally differentiated (Temra) T cell populations, further aggravating immune aging. Both immunosenescence and CMV have been speculated to hamper the formation of protective T‐cell immunity against novel or emerging pathogens. The SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic presented a unique opportunity to examine the impact of age and/or CMV on the generation of de novo SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cell responses in 40 younger (22–40 years) and 37 older (50–66 years) convalescent individuals. Heterotetramer combinatorial coding combined with phenotypic markers were used to study 35 SARS‐CoV‐2 epitope‐specific CD8+ T cell populations directly ex vivo. Neither age nor CMV affected SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cell frequencies, despite reduced total CD8+ Tnaïve cells in older CMV‐ and CMV+ individuals. Robust SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific central memory CD8+ T (Tcm) responses were detected in younger and older adults regardless of CMV status. Our data demonstrate that immune aging and CMV status did not impact the SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cell response. However, SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cells of older CMV‐ individuals displayed the lowest stem cell memory (Tscm), highest Temra and PD1+ populations, suggesting that age, not CMV, may impact long‐term SARS‐CoV‐2 immunity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The contributions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells to vaccine efficacy and durability are unclear. We investigated relationships between mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific interferon- gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody development in long-term care home staff doubly vaccinated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. The impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity on cellular and humoral responses to vaccination were additionally assessed. Mathematical modeling of the kinetics of spike-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 T-cell responses over 6 months post-second dose was bifurcated into recipients who exhibited gradual increases with doubling times of 155 and 167 days or decreases with half-lives of 165 and 132 days, respectively. Differences in kinetics did not correlate with clinical phenotypes. Serological anti-spike IgG, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, anti-spike IgA, and anti-RBD IgA antibody levels otherwise decayed in all participants with half-lives of 63, 57, 79, and 46 days, respectively, alongside waning neutralizing capacity (t1/2 = 408 days). Spike-specific T-cell responses induced at 2–6 weeks positively correlated with live viral neutralization at 6 months post-second dose, especially in hybrid immune individuals. Participants with pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 exhibited greater spike-specific T-cell responses, reduced anti-RBD IgA antibody levels, and a trending increase in neutralization at 2–6 weeks post-second dose. Non-spike-specific T-cells predominantly targeted SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein at 6 months post-second dose in cross-reactive participants. mRNA vaccination was lastly shown to induce off-target T-cell responses against unrelated antigens. In summary, vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell immunity appeared to influence serological neutralizing capacity, with only a modest effect induced by pre-existing cross-reactivity. IMPORTANCE Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential contributions of mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell responses to the durability of neutralizing antibody levels in both uninfected and hybrid immune recipients. Our study additionally sheds light on the precise impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on the magnitude and kinetics of cellular and humoral responses to vaccination. Accordingly, our data will help optimize the development of next-generation T cell-based coronavirus vaccines and vaccine regimens to maximize efficacy and durability.">

        <tr id="Abstract Sepsis‐induced immunosuppression is related to increased susceptibility to secondary infections and death. Lung is the most vulnerable target organ in sepsis, but the understanding of the pulmonary immunosuppression state is still limited. Here, single‐cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is performed to map the landscape of immune cells, revealing a neutrophil‐driven immunosuppressive program in the lungs of patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Although immunosuppressive genes are upregulated in different immune cells, only neutrophils dramatically increase in the BALF of patients in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Five neutrophil subpopulations in BALF are identified, among which CXCR2 + and CD274 (PD‐L1 coding gene)+ IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulations increased significantly during septic immunosuppression. Interestingly, a developmental trajectory from CXCR2 + to CD274 + IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulation is disclosed. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CXCR2 blockade is observed on the survival of septic mice, along with a decreased number of PD‐L1 + neutrophils. Taken together, the CXCR2 + neutrophil subpopulation is discovered as a contributor to immunosuppression in sepsis and identified it as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Model organisms allowing for longitudinal examinations of liver disease pathogenesis are pivotal for the development of new therapeutic modalities. The eastern North American woodchuck develops chronic hepatitis and liver cancer after woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection, mirroring aspects of the natural history of the human hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, the cellular landscape of the woodchuck liver and the cell-level relevance of WHV infection to HBV infection is currently uncharacterized. Methods We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to generate an atlas of healthy woodchuck liver (63,389 cells, n=8) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (26,972 cells, n=7). Cell-specific and hepatic zonation gene signatures were validated using spatial transcriptomics (n=1). We employed our atlas to examine immune activation in stimulated precision cut-liver slices (PCLS) and disease-related pathway activation in chronic WHV infection (11,797 cells, n=3). We further employed our atlas to examine shared disease pathways between WHV infection and human HBV infection. Results Our atlas revealed woodchuck hepatic cellular diversity comparable to human and murine livers. Applying single-nucleus RNA-seq to PMA/ionomycin-stimulated precision cut liver slices revealed inflammation-associated activation signatures in T cell, myeloid and endothelial cell compartment. Finally, we describe intrahepatic T cells in chronic WHV hepatitis with both exhaustion and activation-associated signatures that resemble intrahepatic T cell genes signatures described in human chronic HBV. Conclusions We present a multi-omic atlas of healthy, diseased and ex vivo stimulated woodchuck liver. By identifying shared pathological processes between WHV and HBV infections, our findings reinforce the value of this preclinical model in translational research. This resource aims to advance studies on HBV pathogenesis and oncogenesis to speed the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Impact and Implications/Lay summary The liver plays important roles in metabolism, detoxification, and immune processes; liver transplantation is often the only treatment option for severe chronic liver diseases. Therefore, developing animal models that reflect human liver disease and can be studied throughout the disease course is crucial for the discovery of new treatment options. The woodchuck is an animal that develops chronic hepatitis and liver cancer after infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus, which models the human hepatitis type B virus infection (HBV) and associated hepatic carcinoma. However, our understanding of the cells that compose the woodchuck liver is limited, making it challenging to design and test cell-based therapeutics. In this study, we atlased the healthy and chronically infected woodchuck liver, found that liver cell types in woodchuck resemble those in humans, and employed the atlas to show similarities between WHV and HBV at the cell level, reinforcing the potential of WHV-infected woodchuck as a model for human HBV disease.

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="As the resident macrophages of the brain, microglia are crucial immune cells specific to the central nervous system (CNS). They constantly surveil their surroundings and trigger immunological reactions, playing a key role in various neurodegenerative diseases (ND). As illnesses progress, microglia exhibit multiple phenotypes. Traditionally, microglia have been classified into two main phenotypes upon activation: the pro-inflammatory M1 polarization and the anti-inflammatory M2 polarization. However, this classification is now considered overly simplistic, as it is unable to fully convey the intricacy and diversity of the inflammatory response. Immune regulatory factors, such as chemokines secreted by microglia, are essential for modulating brain development, maintaining the neural milieu, and orchestrating responses to injury, along with the subsequent repair processes. However, in recent years, the significance of metabolic reprogramming in both physiological microglial activity and ND has also become increasingly recognized. Upon activation-triggered by brain injury, infection, or ND-microglia typically modify their metabolic processes by transitioning from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) phosphorylation to glycolysis. This shift facilitates rapid energy production but may also enhance pro-inflammatory responses. This review seeks to summarize metabolic reprogramming and polarization in the function of microglia and their involvement in ND.">

        <tr id="The novel H10N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) has infected four individuals since 2021 and caused severe respiratory damage, posing a significant threat to public health. However, its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our findings revealed that H10N3 infection induces severe lung damage and causes death in mice, even at low doses. The elevated levels of multiple pro-inflammatory factors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly increased during infection, displaying hallmarks of a cytokine storm. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed systematic activation of inflammation-related pathways, predicting that viral infection induces multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Protein-level validation showed that the activation of key cell death markers, including Caspase-3, GSDMD, and MLKL, significantly increased as the infection progressed, with their dynamic changes correlating strongly with the expression pattern of viral proteins. This study elucidates the central role of the synergistic effect between the cytokine storm and multiple cell death pathways in H10N3 pathogenesis. These findings not only advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AIVs but also provide a critical theoretical basis for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.">

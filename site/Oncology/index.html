        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.">

        <tr id="Development of therapeutic approaches that target specific microglia responses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is crucial due to the involvement of microglia in ALS progression. Our study identifies the predominant microglia subset in human ALS primary motor cortex and spinal cord as an undifferentiated phenotype with dysregulated respiratory electron transport. Moreover, we find that the interferon response microglia subset is enriched in donors with aggressive disease progression, while a previously described potentially protective microglia phenotype is depleted in ALS. Additionally, we observe an enrichment of non-microglial immune cell, mainly NK/T cells, in the ALS central nervous system, primarily in the spinal cord. These findings pave the way for the development of microglia subset-specific therapeutic interventions to slow or even stop ALS progression.

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) syndrome or “Long COVID” represents a widespread health challenge that necessitates the development of novel diagnostic approaches and targeted therapies that can be readily deployed. Immune dysregulation has been reported as one of the hallmarks of PASC, but the extent of PASC immune dysregulation in patients over time remains unclear. We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, peripheral immune cell profiles, autoantibody profiles and circulating cytokines for up to 6 months in participants with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who either convalesced or developed PASC. Compared to convalescent, PASC participants with a broad range of PASC phenotypes exhibited persistently elevated IgG titers for SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Nucleocapsid proteins over the 6 months of study duration. In contrast, the IgG responses to Spike protein were significantly lower in the PASC cohort with predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 class-switched bias. Using CyTOF analysis, we show elevated numbers of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) and mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT), which also correlated with high anti-Envelope IgG titers. Persistent immune activation was accompanied by augmented serum cytokine profiles with LIF, IL-11, Eotaxin-3, and HMGB-1 in PASC participants, who also demonstrated significantly higher rates of autoantibodies. These findings highlight the persistence of immune dysregulation in PASC, underscoring the need to explore targeted therapies addressing viral persistence, dysregulated antibody production, and autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to global consequences since its emergence in late 2019, impacting health, economies, and societies worldwide. Understanding the early responses following infection will provide crucial insights into the immune mechanisms governing disease progression and protection. We employed the single-cell RNA-sequencing approach using bronchoalveolar lavage cells of rhesus macaques at 0–3 days post-infection (dpi) in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show the increased abundance of two subsets of macrophages that express IFN-responsive gene signatures, inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and conventional DCs at 3 dpi, coinciding with peak viremia. Moreover, our investigation underscores the enrichment of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-1 signaling pathways within myeloid populations at 2–3 dpi in comparison to baseline. These findings substantially deepen our comprehension, elucidating the transcriptional landscape at the single-cell level during the early phases of COVID-19 within a highly relevant model. IMPORTANCE Understanding the immune response in the early stages of COVID-19 is crucial for developing better treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the first few days after infection. We identify key immune cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that are activated early on and produce important signals to fight the virus. These findings help clarify how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights that could guide future therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to study how human immune responses develop to a novel viral antigen delivered through different vaccine platforms. However, to date, no study has directly compared immune responses to all three FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines at single-cell multi-omic resolution. We longitudinally profiled SARS-CoV-2–naïve adults (n=31) vaccinated with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or Ad26.COV2.S, integrating plasma cytokines, antibody titers, and single-cell multi-omic data (DOGMA-seq). We discovered a distinct, transient interferon program (ISG-dim) that emerged specifically 1–2 days after the first mRNA dose in ~10% of myeloid cells. This state was characterized by ISGF3 complex activation and its target genes (e.g., MX1, MX2, DDX58), with transcriptional and epigenetic profiles distinct from the robust interferon program observed after mRNA boosting or a single Ad26.COV2.S dose (ISG-high). In vitro stimulation of human monocytes showed that IFN-α alone recapitulates ISG-dim, whereas both IFN-α and IFN-γ are required for ISG-high. These findings define dose-dependent interferon programming in human myeloid cells, highlight mechanistic differences between priming and boosting, with implications for optimizing vaccine platform choice, dose scheduling, and formulation.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Understanding age-associated differences in acute and memory adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and how this contributes to more favorable outcomes in children is critically important.


METHODS
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell, B cell, and antibody responses in 329 peripheral blood samples collected from non-hospitalized children, adolescents, and adults at three timepoints, including acute and memory timepoints.


RESULTS
Most children produced robust CD4+ T cell responses during infection and developed memory CD4+ T cells; however, young children <4 years old often had undetectable CD4+ T cell responses compared to older children and adults. Young children also generated reduced frequencies of memory B cells; despite this, they mounted substantial and durable neutralizing antibody responses. CD4+ T cell responses in children were biased towards non-spike epitopes, especially in asymptomatic cases. Memory B cells in children were preferentially classical memory or, paradoxically, CXCR3+.


CONCLUSION
These findings support the concept that the kinetics and composition of T and B cell responses shift across age groups and may be associated with milder COVID-19 outcomes in children.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Long COVID syndrome is a major global health problem, affecting approximately 10–20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus with many remaining symptomatic beyond one year. Fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance and hyperlactataemia on minimal exertion have led to the suggestion of a bioenergetic defect. We hypothesised that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological feature in Long COVID cases and would correlate with clinical outcome. Methods This prospective, case-controlled, observational study recruited 27 participants with an established diagnosis of Long COVID syndrome from a single tertiary clinic together with 16 age-matched controls aged 25–65 years. Seahorse-based mitochondrial flux analysis and bioenergetics profile of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed and correlated with clinical phenotype. Findings Long COVID cases had an increased baseline and ATP-induced oxygen consumption rate with a significant attenuation in tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate fluorescence response to oligomycin. Correlations were observed between mitochondrial function and autonomic health, quality of life and time from index infection. Sex-specific differences were also observed. Interpretation PBMCs from Long COVID subjects exhibit an exceptional and distinctive change in ATP synthase, as it contributes to the mitochondrial membrane potential rather than using it exclusively to generate ATP. The findings suggest that the enzyme runs both forward and reverse reactions, synthesising and hydrolysing ATP. The correlation of mitochondrial function with clinical phenotype in Long COVID may indicate a causal relationship and warrants further validation in larger scale studies.">

While humanized major histocompatibility complex (hMHC) murine models have been extensively utilized in oncological research, their application in virological studies-particularly for coronavirus pathogenesis-remains underexplored. Methods This study systematically characterized immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-challenged hMHC mice lung tissues through comparative transcriptomic profiling, combined with functional enrichment and PPI network analyses. Results Key findings demonstrate that hMHC mice exhibit enhanced immunological activation relative to wild-type controls, particularly in IFN-γ signaling pathways and neutrophil mobilization dynamics that closely parallel human post-vaccination responses. Comparative analysis with human whole blood RNA-seq datasets revealed that hMHC mice exhibit both high reproducibility in transcriptomic profiles and significant similarity to human immune responses across innate and adaptive immunity. Conclusions These results confirm that the hMHC murine model can serve as an effective platform for vaccine research, providing a theoretical foundation for the application of humanized MHC mice and offering new insights into viral infection mechanisms and the development of novel vaccines.">

        <tr id="Stroke triggers a rapid and complex immune response that is not yet fully understood, especially within hours after an ischemic infarct. Our previous study in stroke patients revealed a significant increase in interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) immediately (hyperacute) and downstream of the ischemic ictus, within the arterial compartment. The present study investigated the source, inciting factors, and role of IFN-γ in a preclinical murine model. Stroke was produced using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, and immune cells within the arterial vasculature distal to the occlusion (pre- and post-occlusion) were characterized using flow cytometry. Compared with the control samples, the post-occlusion samples presented an increase in IFN-γ+ and CD69+ cells, whereas no significant increase was detected in IL17+, IL4+, and CD25+ cells. Further analysis of the IFN-γ+ population revealed two novel attributes. First, interrogation of the identity of these IFN-γ+ cells revealed that the increase in IFN-γ production was largely driven by CD14+ cells in the post-occlusion sample, with negligible contributions from other canonical IFN-γ-producing cells (CD4, CD8). Second, the IFN-γ+ cells exhibited two distinct clusters, an IFN-γlow and an IFN-γhi population. Further analysis revealed that the IFN-γ low population was largely composed of CD14+ cells, whereas the IFN-γhi population was dominated by CD4+ T-cells. To explore the conditions driving IFN-γ production, an in vitro ischemia model involving oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was employed. Co-culturing of naïve splenocytes with OGD-treated CNS cells and OGD-derived supernatant resulted in a significant increase in IFN-γ+CD14+ cells, as compared to normoxic controls, an effect that coincided with marked loss of DAPI+ and NeuN+DAPI+ cells in mixed cortical (neuronal and glial) cultures. In summary, this study identified intra-arterial CD14+ monocytes as novel early sources of IFN-γ in the hyperacute phase of stroke, a role traditionally attributed to adaptive immune cells. Using in vivo and in vitro ischemia models, the findings reveal that injury-associated signals from CNS cells are sufficient to directly induce IFN-γ production in CD14+ cells, redefining early stroke immunopathology and uncovering a potential target for timely immunomodulation.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, and accounts for the majority of malaria-associated mortality. Reducing the overwhelming inflammatory responses in the early stage of infection is a key point to prevent death due to CM. In this study, we found that neutrophil mobilization occurred rapidly in response to Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in a murine CM model. Depletion of neutrophils protected the infected mice from neuropathology, with low infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells in the brain, and attenuated activation of dendritic cell (DC) and parasite-specific T cell responses in the spleen. Flow cytometry analysis showed that following PbA infection the expression of TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9 were increased in splenic DC, while only TLR9 expression was reduced after the depletion of neutrophils. To validate the TLR9-dependent activation between neutrophils and DC, we used neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to stimulate bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDC) from WT and Tlr9−/− mice. The results showed that the DNA component of NETs activates DCs through the TLR9/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to upregulated expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which was abolished by DNase I. BMDC stimulated by NETs promoted CD8+ T cell activation with TLR9 dependence. Inhibiting NETs with Sivelestat effectively impeded the onset and progression of CM in the PbA infected mice. Collectively, our results indicated that neutrophil cell death (NETosis) induced TLR9-dependent DC activation and pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses, revealing that the NETs-TLR9/NF-κB-DC-CD8+ T cell axis may provide novel insights into the immunopathogenic mechanisms of CM.

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke induces profound neuroinflammation, where microglial activation exacerbates secondary brain injury. Human umbilical mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUMSC-Exos) exhibit therapeutic potential, but their mechanisms in modulating microglial responses remain incompletely understood. Results Following intranasal administration, hUMSC-Exos selectively accumulated in ischemic brain regions and were internalized by microglia. In transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mice, hUMSC-Exos improved neurological outcomes, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and promoted a sustained shift in microglial polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype—evidenced by suppressed pro-inflammatory and elevated anti-inflammatory markers in peri-infarct areas. These effects were replicated in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated primary microglia and BV2 cells. Microglia-specific RNA sequencing revealed that hUMSC-Exos reversed tMCAO-induced pro-inflammatory and migratory transcriptional programs, concurrently suppressing p38 MAPK while activating immunoregulatory pathways. TREM1 emerged as a critical node, with hUMSC-Exos downregulating its expression in microglia; pharmacological TREM1 inhibition (LP17) synergistically augmented the suppression of microglial activation, migration, and proliferation. Mechanistically, hUMSC-Exos attenuated NF-κB/p38 MAPK signaling, with TREM1 functioning upstream of p38 (validated by overexpression/reversal). Proteomic analysis identified HMGB1 as a key exosomal cargo—its blockade (glycyrrhizin) partially reversed hUMSC-Exos-mediated effects, restoring TREM1 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thus positioning HMGB1 upstream of TREM1. Conclusions Our findings delineate a novel HMGB1-TREM1-p38 MAPK axis through which hUMSC-Exos mitigate post-stroke neuroinflammation. By delivering HMGB1, hUMSC-Exos inhibit TREM1-dependent NF-κB/p38 activation, reprogram microglial function, and confer neuroprotection. Validated across in vivo, primary, and BV2 microglial models, and supported by multi-omics analyses, this study establishes hUMSC-Exos as a promising cell-free therapy targeting microglial reprogramming for ischemic stroke recovery.

Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that the transcriptomic profiles of IFN-induced IFIT3 and other IFN-stimulated genes exhibited marked upregulation in NK cells, defined as CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+IFIT3+ NK cells. Additionally, CM in the blood showed characteristics indicative of differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which further evidenced their potential antiviral functions.

        <tr id="Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dysregulation of lipid droplet homeostasis is a significant factor affecting microglial inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms underlying lipid droplet imbalance in PD are currently unclear. Here, we report a subtype of microglia characterized by high expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) through single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis and machine learning algorithms, linking lipid metabolism to PD neuroinflammation. The results of multiple loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicate that ACSL1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) promotes lipid droplet accumulation to exacerbate microglial activation and dopaminergic neurons death. Mechanistically, activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) leads to the enrichment of ACSL1 on the endoplasmic reticulum, which generates acyl-CoA that are channelled for lipid droplet biogenesis. Additionally, high expression of ACSL1 promotes activation of TBK1 through Nrdp1-mediated K63 ubiquitination of TBK1, which triggers the amplification of the aforementioned biological effects. Moreover, NF-κB directly binds to the ACSL1 promoter and positively regulates its transcription, resulting in increased ACSL1 expression in microglia. Our findings suggest that manipulating lipid droplet biogenesis by modulating ACSL1 may be a potential strategy for treating neuroinflammation in PD patients.

        <tr id="Comprehensive characterization of bovine immune cell populations is essential for improving animal welfare and disease resilience. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 29,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Angus cattle stratified by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a proxy for the cellular immune response (Cell-IR). Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity. Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat highlighted pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, particularly the IL-1β– IL-1R1 ligand-receptor interactions.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is primarily known as a respiratory disease. The continued study of the disease has shown that long-term COVID-19 symptoms include persisting effects of the virus on the brain when the infection is over, possibly even leading to neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanisms of nervous system damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear. In this study, we focused on two possibly shared pathways of SARS-CoV-2-induced neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration: protein aggregation, which is associated with impaired protein clearance, and inflammatory responses, which involve a hyper-active immune status. We observed distinct expression and distribution patterns of ten SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the two cell lines, meanwhile forming aggregation puncta and inducing pro-inflammatory responses. We found that the ER stress was induced and that the autophagy-lysosome pathway was inhibited upon viral protein expression. Boosting autophagy function attenuated protein aggregation, suggesting that modulation of autophagy might be a valid strategy for inhibiting cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV- 2 proteins. Our study provides potential explanations of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage, based on shared cellular mechanisms and furthermore, suggests that modulation of proteostasis may serve as therapeutic strategies for preventing long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 cytotoxic effects.">

        <tr id="Introduction Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is a long-lasting, multisystemic syndrome affecting approximately 30% of individuals after acute COVID-19, with neurological symptoms among the most prevalent and debilitating. Despite its substantial global health impact, the biological mechanisms underlying PCC remain poorly understood, underscoring the need for validated animal models. Methods To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study using the golden Syrian hamster model, integrating virological, immunological, histopathological, and behavioral analyses from the acute phase to 60 days post-inoculation. Results Our results showed persistent viral RNA, prolonged immune dysregulation, and behavioral changes that mirrored key features of human PCC. Discussion Although fully reproducing PCC in animal models is inherently challenging due to its complex and heterogeneous presentation in humans, the use of complementary models with distinct phenotypes is essential for elucidating its pathophysiology. These results aim to contribute valuable insights into the biological basis of PCC and support the development of targeted preventative and therapeutic strategies.">

 Factors regulating the severity of pneumonitis during viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found higher expression of protein S (PROS1) in lung epithelium of mild compared to severe COVID-19 patients. We hypothesised that PROS1 may protect the upper airways by regulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.



 To test this, in vitro air-liquid-interface (ALI) cultures of primary healthy human lung epithelial cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. This model, validated through immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy and single-cell RNA-sequencing, replicated pathogenic changes seen in lungs of COVID-19. Regulation and secretion of PROS1, along with multiple soluble mediators, were quantified in control and infected cultures using ELISAs.



 We found that PROS1 is present in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium and is released during SARS-CoV-2 infection through an IFN-mediated process. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PROS1 downregulated the SARS-CoV-2 induced proinflammatory phenotypes of basal cells, transforming pathogenic CXCL10/11high into a regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 increased the secretion of M-CSF from epithelial cells, which induced the expression of PROS1 receptor MERTK on monocytes interacting with the lung epithelium. PROS1, in turn, shifted SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic monocyte phenotypes towards a phenotype with increased MHC class II.



 These findings highlight the crucial role of PROS1 in protecting against severe lung pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2, by reducing epithelial- and monocyte-derived inflammation, promoting pro-repair epithelial phenotypes, and enhancing antigen presentation in myeloid cells.

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases. Our findings may provide new clues for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and help identify optimal biomarkers for new therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a complex cascade of cellular and molecular responses, yet the complex cellular communication remains incompletely understood. This study explored how intercellular communication contributes to the activation of microglia and astrocytes after SCI. Here, we integrated four datasets using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and constructed a comprehensive cellular atlas of the injured spinal cord. Transcriptomic changes in microglia and astrocytes were analyzed. We identified CD44 as a key receptor in SPP1-mediated microglial activation, which represented a subpopulation involved in inflammatory response in microglia. We defined a gliogenesis subpopulation of astrocytes that emerged at 3 dpi, which became the predominant cell type in the injured spinal cord. These astrocytes highly expressed the Nucleolin (Ncl) gene and interacted via the Pleiotrophin (Ptn) signaling pathway, which is associated with astrocyte proliferation. To validate these findings, we utilized a crush injury model. Flow cytometry of isolated microglia and astrocytes confirmed the upregulation of CD44 in microglia and NCL in astrocytes in response to SCI. In vivo results confirmed that the CD44 positive microglia accumulated and PLA results further confirmed the combination of SPP1 with CD44. In parallel, the upregulated expression of NCL in astrocytes facilitated their proliferation, underscoring the role of the NCL receptor in gliogenesis after SCI. In vitro validation demonstrated that exogenous SPP1 upregulates CD44 expression by promoting the phosphorylation of p65 and activating the NF-κB pathways in BV2 microglia, and that high expression of IL-6 indicates the activation of inflammation. PTN may enhance NCL expression and thus facilitates astrocyte proliferation. Collectively, our study identified key receptors that regulated inflammation responses and gliogenesis. Targeting the CD44 and NCL receptors may provide promising therapeutic strategies to modulate inflammation and promote tissue repair after SCI.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is the major contributor to the pathology of neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (HI) brain injury. Our previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA210 (miR210) inhibition with antisense locked nucleic acid (LNA) inhibitor mitigates neuroinflammation and provides neuroprotection after neonatal HI insult. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, using miR210 knockout (KO) mice and microglial cultures, we tested the hypothesis that miR210 promotes microglial activation and neuroinflammation through suppressing mitochondrial function in microglia after HI. Neonatal HI brain injury was conducted on postnatal day 9 (P9) wild-type (WT) and miR210 knockout (KO) mouse pups. We found that miR210 KO significantly reduced brain infarct size at 48 h and improved long-term locomotor functions assessed by an open field test three weeks after HI. Moreover, miR210 KO mice exhibited reduced IL1β levels, microglia activation and immune cell infiltration after HI. In addition, in vitro studies of microglia exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) revealed that miR210 inhibition with LNA reduced OGD-induced expression of Il1b and rescued OGD-mediated downregulation of mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity. To validate the link between miR210 and microglia activation, isolated primary murine microglia were transfected with miR210 mimic or negative control. The results showed that miR210 mimic downregulated the expression of mitochondrial ISCU protein abundance and induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines similar to the effect observed with ISCU silencing RNA. In summary, our results suggest that miR210 is a key regulator of microglial proinflammatory activation through reprogramming mitochondrial function in neonatal HI brain injury.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The markedly reduced pathogenicity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant in comparison to earlier strains has raised critical questions regarding its underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the host immune responses driving these differences, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of lung and blood samples from human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice infected with either the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain or the Omicron BA.1 variant at 5 days post-inoculation. Both strains induced a reduction in lung cell numbers, with capillary endothelial cells showing the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Shared transcriptional responses included upregulation of chemokine (e.g. Gnaq, Lyn, Ccl5) and IL-17 signaling pathways. Notably, Omicron BA.1 infection resulted in downregulation of Txnip, a key gene involved in oxidative stress responses. Genes associated with neutrophil granules and pro-inflammatory functions (Mmp8, S100a8, S100a9) were also downregulated, whereas wound healing pathways were upregulated in immature neutrophils. Additionally, Omicron BA.1 altered gene expression associated with neutrophil migration from blood to lung, and decreased the activation of cell chemotaxis, cytokine-mediated signaling, IL-17 and NF-κB pathways in pro-inflammatory monocytes and pulmonary interstitial macrophages. These findings highlight distinct immunological signatures contributing to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron BA.1, particularly through the modulation of neutrophil and monocyte-macrophage responses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aims Sustained neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke impedes post‐injury tissue repairment and neurological functional recovery. Developing innovative therapeutic strategies that simultaneously suppress detrimental inflammatory cascades and facilitate neurorestorative processes is critical for improving long‐term rehabilitation outcomes. Methods We employed a microglia depletion‐repopulation paradigm by administering PLX5622 for 7 days post‐ischemia; followed by a 7‐day withdrawal period to allow microglia repopulation. Single‐cell transcriptomics, behavioral testing, cytokine arrays, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to assess the effects of microglia repopulation and delineate the transition of reshaped immune microenvironment. Results PLX5622 administration reshaped the poststroke immune microenvironment, promoting neurofunctional recovery. Repopulated microglia adopted a homeostatic phenotype, increasing homeostatic states by ~14.36% and reducing pro‐inflammatory states by ~20.17%. This reshaped environment suppressed T cell exhaustion, limited neutrophil terminal differentiation, and promoted a phagocytic macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, we identified that these transitions in infiltrating immune cells may be driven by reduced chemokine production, enhanced blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and transcriptional reprogramming. Conclusion Transient microglial depletion and repopulation via PLX5622 during the acute phase post stroke facilitate the recovery of neurological function. This immunomodulatory strategy offers a promising and clinically translationally relevant approach to enhance functional recovery following ischemic brain injury.">

Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-ɑ was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-ɑ-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-ɑ and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Background Although COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory tract, liver injury has been increasingly reported in infected individuals. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces hepatocyte damage remain poorly understood. Given the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and regulated cell death in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatocytes using the Huh7.5 cell model. Methods Huh7.5 hepatocytes were infected with either the ancestral Wuhan (Wh) or Omicron (BA.5) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Viral replication was quantified via RT-qPCR, nucleocapsid protein detection, and infectious particle titration. Mitochondrial function was assessed through mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mROS production, and mitophagy analysis. Lipid metabolism and regulated cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis) were evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The role of specific cell death pathways was probed using chemical inhibitors. Results Both SARS-CoV-2 variants efficiently infected Huh7.5 cells, with distinct replication kinetics. Infection induced mitochondrial fragmentation, elevated mROS levels, and lipid droplet accumulation. Ferroptosis was identified as a predominant mode of cell death, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and the protective effect of ferrostatin-1. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a ferroptosis marker and alternative viral entry receptor, was significantly upregulated post-infection in a variant-dependent manner. Additionally, mROS scavenging with MitoTEMPO impaired viral replication, underscoring the role of oxidative stress in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, promoting ferroptosis as a major contributor to virus-induced cytopathology. These findings suggest that ferroptosis may play a central role in COVID-19-related liver injury and identify mitochondrial ROS and iron metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="To better understand the molecular mechanism that drives neuroinflammation, we analyzed the protein profiles of 27 brains from HIV with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), including various stages of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and compared them to 9 HAND-negative controls. We found that most of the proteins that were increased—about 66.7%—were involved in immune response pathways. Of these, 23.3% were specifically related to type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which remains active in the brain through both HIV-related and unrelated mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on brain tissues collected during rapid autopsies from participants in the Last Gift cohort, we found that IFN-I signaling was especially strong in astrocytes, microglia (MG), and endothelial cells. In a mini-brain organoid model of acute HIV infection, IFN-I signaling was also highly active in astrocytes but less so in MG. Interestingly, IFN-I activation can happen without HIV being present—expression of human endogenous retrovirus-W1 (HERV-W1) Env can directly trigger this response in astrocytes, and it continues in glial cells even with effective ART. Together, our findings point to persistent IFN-I activation in glial and endothelial cells in the brain, which may contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive disorders in PWH on ART.">

Peripheral monocytes are crucial components of the human immune system, but their contribution to AD pathogenesis is still largely understudied partially due to limited human models. Here, we introduce human cortical organoid microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) to study AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. By culturing doughnut-shape organoids on 3D-printed devices within standard 96-well plates, we generate hCO-MPSs with reduced necrosis, minimized hypoxia, and improved viability. Using these models, we found that monocytes from AD patients exhibit increased infiltration ability, decreased amyloid-β clearance capacity, and stronger inflammatory response than monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, we observed that AD monocytes induce pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the marked increase in IL1B and CCL3 expression underscores their pivotal role in AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. Our findings provide insight into understanding monocytes’ role in AD pathogenesis, and our lab-compatible MPS models may offer a promising way for studying various neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Objective Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) is a major pathogen of severe hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children, but the mechanism by which it develops into severe HFMD remains unclear, especially the role of macrophage-mediated immune dysregulation. Methods Bioinformatics tools were utilized to analyze the transcriptome sequencing results of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) infected with different titers of EV-A71 at various time points. Single-cell sequencing technology was used to sequence obtained PBMCs from a severe HFMD patient due to EV-A71 and a healthy control. Macrophages infected with EV-A71 were collected for transcriptomic analysis, and were indirectly co-cultured with nerve cells to observe their inhibitory effects on nerve cells. Results Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that EV-A71 infected severe HFMD patient had higher monocyte and macrophage ratio (18.50% vs. 8.85%), especially classical (64.59% vs. 57.24%) and non-classical (32.23% vs. 23.90%) monocytes, and a lower pDC (1.19% vs. 12.01%) and monoDC (1.98% vs. 6.80%) in EV-A71 infected severe HFMD patient. Dynamic analysis of PBMCs infected with EV-A71 isolates (mild, moderate and severe) and cell trajectory analysis indicated during infection, monocyte/macrophages were initially activated, followed by three groups of T cells and NK and B cells, M1 macrophage. High concentration of EV-A71 infected macrophage supernatant inhibited SH-SY5Y cell proliferation. ENSG00000285779, TICAM2, RPL13AP26 and HNF4G are significantly different in EV-A71 or inactivated EV-A71 infected macrophages than in control. ENSG00000264324, ENSG00000260643, ISLR2, CCR7, TENM4, INO80B-WBP1, BLOC1S5-TXNDC5 are potential genes about direct virus damage or viral RNA recognition in macrophages. GO annotation and KEGG analysis indicate that EV-A71 infection cause the changes of neural receptor-ligand binding pathway, activation of specific immunity, calcium signaling pathway, and cell aggregation. Conclusions Macrophages are activated early during EV-A71 infection, thus initiating specific immunity, which is closely related to the severe HFMD. The nerve damage pathway and calcium signaling pathway caused by EV-A71 virus infection of macrophages deserve to more attention.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system can develop a form of memory called priming, where prior exposure to a stimulus enhances subsequent responses. While well-characterized in peripheral immunity, its function in brain-resident cells such as astrocytes under non-disease conditions remains unclear. Here we show that human astrocytes derived from the induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy female donors, but not microglia, acquire a primed state following transient immune stimulations. Upon subsequent exposure to amyloid-β (Aβ), these astrocytes secrete elevated levels of cytokines and promote microglial Aβ uptake. In contrast, astrocytes carrying the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk allele APOE4 exhibit reduced priming and fail to support microglial phagocytosis. These findings are validated in astrocyte-microglial co-cultures, cerebral organoids, and male mice, where astrocyte priming enhances Aβ clearance in an APOE4-sensitive manner. Our findings identify astrocytic immune memory as a modulator of microglial function and Aβ pathology, providing insights into how early protective responses in AD may be disrupted by genetic risk factors.">

        <tr id="African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an important transboundary animal pathogen with significant impacts on the global swine industry. Overwhelming proinflammatory responses are a major virulence mechanism for ASFV, but the dynamics of these changes during clinical disease are not completely understood. We constructed a detailed portrait of the innate immune responses during acute African swine fever (ASF) at the cellular, transcriptomic, and cytokine levels. Samples serially obtained from infected piglets show progression of acute ASF is characterized by rapid increases in plasma type I interferons, TNF-α, IL-12p40, and IL-10, which coincide with the manifestation of clinical disease and viral DNAemia. Lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells progressively declined, with fluctuations in B cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell populations. Blood monocytes and macrophages were highly variable throughout infection, with an abrupt spike in CD203+ mature macrophages immediately prior to death. Transcriptomic analysis of blood showed downregulation of cellular translation as early as 1 day post challenge (DPC), and significant upregulation of antiviral immune processes at 5 DPC and 7 DPC which overlapped with the onset of clinical disease. Together, these results present a highly detailed delineation of fatal ASF as involving an initial infection and damage of susceptible myeloid cells prior to symptomatic disease characterized by pro-inflammatory immune responses, lymphoid depletion, and clinical deterioration.">

        <tr id="Children with COVID-19 typically experience milder symptoms and lower hospitalization rates, though severe cases do occur. Understanding age-related immune responses is crucial for future preparedness. We characterized immune response dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in 145 samples from 119 pediatric patients (<18 years) with confirmed infection, assessed at four distinct time points: <14 days, 14 days–3 months, 3–6 months, and 6–12 months post-infection. At infection, patients presented increased activated T-cells, higher levels of exhaustion (i.e., PD-1+), lower numbers of unswitched memory B-cells, and increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Both humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses increased over time (all patients showed measurable responses in the last assessment). Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients (58.6%) showed increased specific cellular responses from infection onwards, along with enriched memory B-cell subsets (but not ASCs), and distinct T-cell activation profiles. Children with severe disease were younger, predominantly boys, displayed altered T/B-cell ratios, and reduced PHA responses when infected. Compared to adolescents, younger children showed lower antibody titers and weaker cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2, possibly underlining the higher prevalence of severe manifestations in younger children. Our study illustrates important age-, gender-, and disease severity-dependent variations in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which can be helpful in improving patient management and immunization strategies adjusted to age groups.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV-infected and bystander-activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV-infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV-infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately affected individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, such as neurocognitive disorders. Premorbid neurocognitive conditions compounded by COVID-19 can escalate into COVID-associated neurological complications, leading to severe illness or even death. As COVID-19 continues to persist and vaccines lose efficacy against emerging variants, individuals with neurocognitive disorders often experience prolonged symptoms that are further exacerbated by repeated breakthrough infections of highly diversified viral variants due to emergence of new viral mutations. Despite the significance of neurocognitive disorders as risk factors for COVID-19-related mortality and long COVID, the underlying causes remain largely unknown. In this study, we report a link between ORF3a expression and COVID-associated neuroinflammation and neurocytotoxicity in postmortem brain tissues from COVID-19 patients. These findings were further verified through neural cell-based in vitro and in vivo animal studies introducing ORF3a either alone or in the context of viral infection. As a membrane-associated protein, ORF3a induces upregulation of Sur1-regulated ion channels, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ influx, apoptosis, and necrosis through both NF-kB-dependent and independent proinflammatory responses in astrocytes. These findings reveal a novel clinical and mechanistic link between ORF3a and Sur1-regulated ion channels, which are highly responsive to neuroinflammatory conditions causing neurodegeneration. Additionally, we have identified a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, glibenclamide, and a natural antiviral compound glycyrrhizin that effectively mitigates the neuropathological effects of ORF3a, underscoring the therapeutic potential and clinical significance of these findings. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disproportionately affects individuals with pre-existing neurocognitive conditions primarily due to COVID-19-associated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity (CNN), which can progress to COVID-associated neurological disorders (CANDs), leading to severe illness and mortality. Despite CNN’s significant contribution to CANDs and related morbidity and mortality, its underlying causes remain poorly understood. Our study identifies ORF3a as a key driver of CNN, establishing a direct clinical and functional link between ORF3a and CNN linking to CANDs. Mechanistically, ORF3a disrupts ion homeostasis in astrocytes by promoting Ca²+ influx through Sur1-regulated ion channels, contributing to CNN. Notably, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug glibenclamide, a Sur1-specific inhibitor, and the natural compound glycyrrhizin effectively mitigate ORF3a-induced neuropathology, highlighting ORF3a as a promising therapeutic target. These findings present a potential strategy to eliminate CNN and prevent CANDs.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia continuously monitor neuronal health through somatic purinergic junctions, where microglial processes establish dynamic contacts with neuronal cell bodies. The P2Y12 receptor is a key component of these junctions, essential for intercellular communication between ramified microglia and neurons under homeostatic conditions. However, during chronic neurodegeneration, such as that seen in prion diseases, microglia transition from process-based surveillance to extensive body-to-body interactions, enveloping neuronal somata. Despite its widespread use as a homeostatic marker, the functional role of P2Y12 in chronic neurodegenerative contexts remains largely unexplored. Methods We investigated how genetic deletion of P2Y12 affects microglial morphology and microglia-neuron interactions in both healthy and prion-infected adult mice. In parallel, we assessed the impact of P2Y12 loss on prion disease progression and associated neuropathology. Results In healthy adult mice, deletion of P2Y12 significantly disrupted canonical process-to-soma contacts, while paradoxically promoting increased microglia-neuron body-to-body interactions. This finding uncovers a previously unrecognized, P2Y12-independent mode of microglial engagement with neurons. Strikingly, in prion-infected mice, P2Y12 loss significantly increased the prevalence of neuronal envelopment by reactive microglia, and accelerated disease progression. Notably, this acceleration occurred without affecting prion accumulation or hippocampal neuronal loss, implicating altered microglia-neuron interactions - specifically excessive envelopment - as a key driver of disease exacerbation. Conclusions This study redefines P2Y12 not as a passive marker of homeostasis but as an active regulator of neuroimmune dynamics. We demonstrate that P2Y12 is essential for maintaining balanced microglia-neuron communication under physiological conditions and for restraining maladaptive microglial behavior during chronic neurodegeneration associated with prion disease. These findings uncover a novel mechanism by which microglia contribute to disease progression and position P2Y12 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating microglial responses in neurodegenerative disorders.

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is recognized as a critical pathological process in meningitic Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection, leading to severe neurodegenerative disorders and long-term sequelae. Astrocyte reactivity plays a pivotal role in driving the neuroinflammatory cascade in response to pathological stimuli from peripheral sources or other cellular components of the CNS. The involvement of astrocyte reactivity in the inflammatory process induced by bacterial infection within the CNS warrants further investigation. In this study, we observed an astrocyte reaction likely mediated by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) during meningitic E. coli infection in both a mouse model and a BMEC-astrocyte coculture system. Through label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of the BMEC secretome, we identified CK2 as a potential trigger for astrocyte reactivity. Inhibition of CK2 attenuated the reaction of hippocampal astrocytes in E. coli meningitis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CK2 enhances NF-κB activation via its interaction with myosin 9, thereby increasing astrocyte reactivity and the inflammatory response both in vivo and in vitro. By conditionally knocking out CK2β in microvessel, we blocked CK2 secretion, resulting in reduced astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation during the early stages of infection. Compared to wild-type mice, CK2βVas-/- mice exhibited a significantly higher survival rate. Collectively, our findings highlight the essential role of endothelial-glial communication mediated by CK2 interaction with myosin 9 in activating the downstream NF-κB pathway, contributing to astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation. These results provide novel insights into the treatment of CNS inflammation caused by bacterial blood-borne infections.">

        <tr id="Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect substantial populations worldwide and increase the risk of developing cognitive impairments and alcohol-associated dementia. While chronic inflammatory signaling likely plays an important role in alcohol-associated neurological sequalae, the precise mechanisms underlying alcohol-associated neuropathology remain enigmatic. We hypothesize that alcohol leads to neuroimmune dysregulation among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia; and is perpetuated by innate immune signaling pathways involving cell-cell signaling. To investigate how alcohol dysregulates neuroimmune interactions in a human context, we constructed a triculture model comprising neurons, astrocytes, and microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. After exposure to ethanol, we observed significant differential gene expression relating to innate immune pathways, inflammation, and microglial activation. Microglial activation was confirmed with morphological analysis and expression of CD68, a lysosomal-associated membrane protein and marker for phagocytic microglial activation. A striking finding in our study was the elevation of TREM2 expression and, specifically, TREM2 alternative splice variants that are predicted to give rise to soluble TREM2. TREM2 has been reported to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. These results suggest that ethanol exposure in the brain may lead to increased microglial activation and production of soluble isoform named TREM2219 through alternate splicing. Deciphering the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning ethanol-related neuroimmune dysregulation within a human context promises to shed light on the etiology of AUD-related disorders, potentially contributing to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a hallmark of neovascular age‐related macular degeneration, a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the elderly. While immune dysregulation and myeloid cell activation have been implicated in CNV pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which myeloid subsets influence NV remain incompletely understood. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is an immunomodulatory receptor enriched in microglia and tissue macrophages, known to play protective roles in retinal and neurodegenerative diseases. However, its function in CNV has not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the role of TREM2 in CNV using transcriptomic, genetic, and functional approaches. Single‐cell RNA sequencing revealed selective upregulation of Trem2 in activated microglia and macrophages following laser‐induced CNV. These findings were validated at the protein level using immunostaining, which confirmed robust TREM2 expression in lesion‐associated IBA1+ myeloid cells. Functionally, Trem2 haploinsufficiency exacerbated CNV lesion size and vascular leakage, indicating a protective role in disease modulation. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that Trem2‐expressing myeloid cells exhibit distinct angiogenic and inflammasome‐related gene signatures, suggesting that TREM2 regulates angiogenesis through modulation of inflammatory pathways. We further examined the functional interaction between TREM2 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), another anti‐inflammatory mediator upregulated during CNV. Using compound mutant mice, we showed that Trem2 and SOCS3 function through overlapping but independent anti‐angiogenic programs, and their combined deficiency leads to additive worsening of CNV pathology. These findings establish TREM2 as a key regulator of myeloid cell function and angiogenesis in the diseased retina.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a severe neurological condition associated with high rates of mortality or long‐term disability. Despite its clinical significance, the detailed cellular mechanisms underlying HIE remain unclear. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity across development, aging, and disease processes. However, no scRNA‐seq studies have yet addressed neonatal HIE. In this study, we employed scRNA‐seq to examine cellular heterogeneity during neonatal HIE. We analyzed a total of 87 580 high‐quality brain cells to identify transcriptional changes associated with HIE. In the hyperacute phase, we observed astrocytes in response to tumor necrosis factors, involvement of microglia in phagocytosis, Stat3‐mediated ischemic responses in oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and an increase in senescent lymphatic endothelial cells. In the acute phase, astrocytes were activated and involved in gliogenesis, while microglia proliferated. Neuroblasts were affected by metal ions, and oligodendrocytes decreased. In the subacute phase, astrocytes involved in inflammation and antigen presentation, while inflammatory microglia highly expressing MHC II were induced by the IL27 and type I interferon pathways and expanded. Additionally, peripheral immune cells played vital roles in HIE. Specifically, neutrophils infiltrated and expanded throughout all phases post‐HIE. Spp1 high macrophages, T cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells increased during the acute and subacute phases, and B cells expanded during the subacute phase. This study offers deep insights into the molecular alterations of key cell types following HIE, elucidating the pathological processes involved. These findings have significant implications for developing effective clinical strategies for managing HIE.">

        <tr id="RhoA, a small GTPase, plays a pivotal role in various diseases, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Although RhoA inhibition has been traditionally viewed as beneficial for SCI repair, recent clinical trials of RhoA inhibitors in SCI have failed to show significant therapeutic efficacy, suggesting functional heterogeneity across different cell types. The role of RhoA in microglia, the key immune cells involve in SCI, remains poorly understood. Using microglial RhoA conditional knockout mice, this study demonstrated that RhoA deficiency in microglia attenuates the morphological and functional repair of the SCI mice, and impairs the microglial biofunctions of proliferation, phagocytosis, and migration. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and metabolomics revealed that RhoA deficiency can attenuate the microglial glycolytic enzyme expression, ATP production, ECAR and OCR levels through the Arhgap25/HIF-1α pathway. Overall, this is the first study to demonstrate that microglial RhoA is essential for SCI repair, the Arhgap25/HIF-1α pathway mediated glucose metabolism might enlighten a novel insight to enrich the understanding on the complex roles of RhoA and microglia in SCI repair. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of considering cell-specific roles of RhoA in SCI repair and provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies aimed at microglial metabolic reprogramming.

        <tr id="Background Myeloid cells, such as resident microglia (MG), infiltrating monocytes (Mo), macrophages (MΦ), and CNS border-associated macrophages (BAM) in the brain, participate in aged brain injury. Aged microglial replacement is protective against brain injury in aged mice; however, whether/how the molecular changes in myeloid cells are affected by this replacement in injured brains remains unclear. Methods Aged microglia in mice were eliminated by PLX3397 for 21 consecutive days and repopulated following withdrawal for 21 days; then, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) models were constructed. Then, a single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of acutely injured brains in aged mice with microglial replacement was performed. Results We observed similarities but strong divergence in the composition and molecular change features of myeloid cells between the replacement (Rep) and control (Con) groups, indicating retention of the core transcriptome and development of differential genes in myeloid cells after microglial replacement in response to brain injury. Both MG and Mo/MΦ experience modification of immune responses after microglial repopulation, with more prominent changes in MG. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that one term directly related to the “immune response” was shared between upregulated genes in Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, while the other terms related to immune functions and other biofunctions were different between Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, indicative of significantly different immune responses to brain injury between MG and MΦ. Furthermore, the trajectory analysis showed a significant transition from aged to young state in Rep-MG compared to only a modest youthful shift in Rep-Mo/MΦ, suggesting a rejuvenation process of aged microglia and macrophages toward young ones in response to brain injury after the treatment of microglial replacement. Conclusion Our data indicate that microglial replacement-induced changes in the molecular heterogeneity and state transition of myeloid cells may be neuroprotective against acute brain injury.">

        <tr id="Introduction An unbalanced immune response and excessive inflammation are the major hallmarks of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in multiorgan failure and death. The dysregulation of the complement system has been shown in various studies as a crucial factor in the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Complement alternative pathway has been linked to the excessive inflammation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in which decreased levels of factor H (FH) and elevated levels of properdin (FP) were observed. The current study investigated the potential immune protective roles of FP and FH against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods The interactions between FH and FP and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and its receptor binding domain (RBD) were evaluated using direct ELISA. The cell binding and luciferase-based viral entry assays utilising S protein expressing lentiviral pseudotypes were used to evaluate the possible modulatory effects of FH, FP, and recombinant thrombospondin repeats 4 and 5 (TSR4 + 5) on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Using RT-qPCR, we also assessed the immunomodulatory roles of FH and FP in the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes. Results FH and FP were found to bind to both the RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The treatment of FP or TSR4 + 5 enhanced cell binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes that was administered in A549 cells expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells). FP increases the affinity between host ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2, according to in silico work. In A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells, the effect of FP on viral cell entry and binding was counteracted by anti-FP antibody treatment. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes’ cell entry and binding were decreased by FH treatment. The A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 alphaviral pseudotypes (expressing spike, envelope, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins) pre-treated with FP or TSR4+5 showed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts, including NF-κB and IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-α, and RANTES. Contrary to this, the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated by FH treatment. FH treatment decreased S protein-mediated NF-κB activation, but FP treatment enhanced it in A549-hACE2+TMPRSS2 cells. Discussion These results imply that FH may function as a SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and binding inhibitor, reducing the inflammatory response linked to infection independently of complement activation. FP could aid cell viral entry and binding and aggravate hyperinflammation that might contribute to the severity of the infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT RNA viruses have high mutation frequency, quick generation periods and vast population numbers, which promote fast evolution and host environment adaptation. We integrated scRNA‐seq and spatial transcriptomics to profile immune cells and viral gene expression in COVID‐19. Cell types and interactions were identified using Seurat‐based tools. Spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed viral hotspots, and GISAID data were used to track SARS‐CoV‐2 mutations. Single‐cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses revealed that immune cells such as Neutrophils, Monocyte:CD14 + , and T cell:CD4+ central memory are highly abundant in COVID‐19 patients, particularly in mild and severe cases, and are concentrated in the central and upper regions of lung tissue. Pseudotime and CellChat analyses indicated that cell differentiation trajectories and communication networks shift toward heightened inflammatory responses in severe conditions. Spatial analysis of viral gene expression showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 genes, especially Nucleoprotein, Spike and Envelope were highly expressed in central and upper‐right tissue regions, suggesting active viral replication. This localized viral activity was strongly associated with areas of immune cell infiltration and inflammation. The top 10 sustainable mutants in SARS‐CoV‐2 genome with high frequency were observed in NSP12 (P323L, 99%, Switzerland), Spike (D614G, 97%, Switzerland), NSP4 (T492I, 79%, Switzerland), NSP6 (T77A, 70%, Guangdong), Orf9c (G50N, 64%, England), Nucleoprotein (D377Y, 62%, United States), Orf9b (T60A, 61%, France), NSP14 (I42V, 55%, United States), Envelope (T9I, 51.3%, Trinidad and Tobago), and NSP5 (P132H, 51.2%, United States). Following to this approach is crucial for a strong epidemiological reaction against the changing SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak.">

To prepare for future pandemics and the development of improved vaccines, it is vital to identify the immunological changes underlying influenza disease severity. Methods We combined unsupervised high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry with gene expression analyses, plasma CXCL13 measurements, and antigen-specific immune cell assays to characterize the immune profiles of hospitalized patients with severe and moderate seasonal influenza disease during active infection and at 6-month follow-up. We used age-matched healthy donors as controls. Results Severe disease was associated with a distinct immune profile, including lower frequencies of ICOS+ mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and CXCR5+ memory B and CD4+CXCR5+CD95+ICOS+ and CD8+CXCR3+CD95+PD-1+TIGIT+ memory T cells, as well as lower CD4 gene expression. Higher frequencies of CD16+CD161+ NK cells, CD169+ monocytes, CD123+/− dendritic cells, and CD38high plasma cells and high CXCL13 plasma levels were also associated with severe disease. Alterations in immune cell subpopulations persisted at convalescence for the severely ill patients only. Conclusions Our results indicated a reduction in regulatory MAIT cells and memory T and B cells and an increase in the inhibitory subpopulations of monocytes and NK cells in severe influenza that persisted at convalescence. These immune cell alterations were associated with higher age and the presence of several underlying conditions that may contribute to frailty. This study illustrates the power and sensitivity of high-dimensional single-cell analyses in identifying potential cellular biomarkers for disease severity after influenza infection.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with cytotoxic activity against tumors and viruses. The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the investigation of their role in disease severity. However, their functional status and modulators remain controversial. Recent studies highlighted the role of metabolism in immune function, but metabolic changes in NK cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unexplored. This study compares metabolic (SIRT1, AMPKA, HIF1A, and GLUT1) and inflammatory (NFKB1, NFKB1A, IFNG, and SOCS1) gene expression, and flow cytometry-based assessment of functional markers in NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients (n=15) and the control group (n=10), and their association with clinical outcomes. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated IFNγ, Granzyme B, and KIR2DL1 expression in NK cells compared to controls (P < 0.005), while LAMP1 was unchanged (P > 0.05). NK cells from deceased patients exhibited significantly lower expression levels of LAMP1 and Granzyme B (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized >7 days presented lower Granzyme-B+ NK cells (P < 0.05). NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients showed downregulation of HIF1A and GLUT1, and upregulation of NFKB1 (P < 0.05). HIF1A and GLUT1 expression were elevated in patients with >7 days of hospitalization (P < 0.05). SIRT1 expression was higher in patients requiring intubation (P < 0.05). SIRT1, HIF1A, and GLUT1 were upregulated in deceased patients (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrate that NK cells from patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit increased functional markers and dysregulated metabolic gene expression associated with clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with platelet hyperreactivity and increased rates of arterial and venous thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 mutations have resulted in several variants with differences in transmissibility, infectivity, and patient outcomes. This study investigates the effects of the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 (WA1) and two variants of concern, Delta and Omicron, on the human megakaryocyte (MK) phenotype and transcriptome. Human CD34+-derived MKs were incubated with WA1, Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants for 24 hours. MK activation markers were measured under resting and thrombin-stimulated conditions. RNA-seq and cytokine release in response to the viruses were assessed. Plasma cytokines were measured in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Treatment of MKs with WA1, Delta or Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in similar increases in classical activation markers. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants mediated distinct transcriptomic changes. Across variants, 60 genes overlapped, including CXCL8. Consistent with transcriptomic changes, SARS-CoV-2-incubated MKs secreted significantly elevated levels of IL-8. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, plasma IL-8 levels were highest in COVID-19 patients who subsequently experienced thrombotic events or died. In conclusion, WA1, Delta, and Omicron similarly induce classical MK activation responses while mediating distinct transcriptomic changes. Increased IL-8 levels may serve as a biomarker to inform platelet hyperreactivity and thrombotic events associated with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Boosting myelin repair is widely recognized as one of the most powerful approaches for demyelinating therapy, essentially contributing to the recovery of neurological functions. Maintaining immune homeostasis in microglia is a prerequisite for creating a reparative environment for myelin. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is clinically effective in reshaping immunological status and implies potential in treating demyelinating disease. However, its relevance to pro-remyelination remains unclear. Methods We first evaluated the effects of DHA on neurofunctional recovery and white matter integrity in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an ideal model for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) characterized by remyelination deficiency. Single-cell sequencing and microglial depletion with PLX3397 in vivo were used to reveal the dependency between DHA and microglia. The effect of DHA on the reparative phenotype of microglia, particularly on cholesterol recycling and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), was evaluated in microglia-OPCs unit either in vitro or in vivo challenged with myelin debris. Finally, to broaden the clinical application for DHA in myelin repair, it was tested in the cuprizone (CPZ) model which shows remyelination failure, a condition common in various neurodegenerative diseases. Results We demonstrated for the first time that DHA enhanced white matter integrity and OPCs proliferation and differentiation. This effect is dependent on the transition of microglia to a reparative phenotype. Specifically, DHA increased the secretion of inflammatory-resolving and neurotrophic cytokines. It further functionalized cholesterol recycling and provided metabolic support for myelin regeneration predominantly mediated by liver X receptor (LXR) in microglia. This was evidenced by the promotion of myelin debris uptake, cholesterol catabolism, efflux and transport. Notably, DHA promoted remyelination and neurological functional recovery in CPZ-induced demyelinating model, supporting its potential application in neurodegenerative diseases featuring insufficient remyelination. Conclusion By highlighting the importance of microglia in promoting myelin regeneration, our study proved DHA as a promising candidate for promoting remyelination. Graphical Abstract A schematic diagram illustrates that DHA enhances remyelination by inducing a reparative phenotype of microglia mainly through its function in cholesterol recycling, thereby creating a permissive immune environment for OPCs proliferation and differentiation.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a health risk for humans and other domestic and wildlife species. Recently, North American elk have been identified as seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a potential threat to humans and other mammals. In this work, we characterized the peripheral transcriptomic response to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in calves and adult elk at different time points. Results Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified at 2-, 5-, and 14-days post inoculation (pi) for both age groups. Adult elk presented the greatest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes at all time points, including many genes associated with viral response, immune activation, antibody production, as well as genes associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and coronavirus GO terms and KEGG pathways. Calves presented DE genes associated with viral responses at 5 days pi as well as neurodegenerative-associated genes at 14 days pi.

        <tr id="Rationale: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Non-neuronal cells, particularly astrocytes, have been recognized as pivotal contributors to ALS onset and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms of interactions between astrocytes and motor neurons during ALS remain unclear. Recent studies have identified the neuronal Hippo kinase mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) as a key regulator of neurodegeneration in ALS. Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is predominantly expressed in astrocytes. However, the role of astrocytic YAP in ALS and its underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. Methods: To evaluate the function of YAP in ALS, we established a C9orf72-poly-GA mouse model (ALS mice) via intracerebroventricular injection of AAV viruses. Furthermore, mice with conditional knockout (CKO) of YAP in astrocytes (YAPGFAP-CKO mice) were generated and then YAPGFAP-CKO ALS mice and their littermate controls (YAPf/f ALS mice) were used as experimental subjects. Behavioral tests, immunostaining, Nissl staining, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and Western blotting were used to assess the effects of astrocytic YAP deletion in ALS progression. In addition, we investigated the role and mechanism of astrocytic YAP in the pathogenesis of ALS by integrating RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from primary cultured astrocytes with single-nucleus transcriptomic (snRNA-seq) from C9orf72-ALS/FTD patients. Then, in vitro experiments including primary cultured astrocytes and neurons were used to further elucidate the potential molecular mechanism of astrocytic YAP in ALS. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of the excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2) activator LDN-212320 and the Hippo kinase MST1/2 inhibitor XMU-MP-1 as candidate treatments for ALS. Results: We found that YAP was upregulated and activated specifically in astrocytes, but not in neurons or microglia, within the motor cortex of ALS mice. Conditional knockout of YAP in astrocytes exacerbated motor deficits, neuronal loss, pathological translocation of TDP-43, inflammatory infiltration, and reduced astrocytic proliferation in ALS mice. Mechanistically, Wnts secreted by degenerating neurons and astrocytes activated YAP/β-catenin signaling and further promoted the expression of EAAT2 in astrocytes, which prevented neuronal glutamate excitotoxicity, neuronal loss, and motor dysfunction in ALS mice. Interestingly, treatment with LDN-212320 promoted EAAT2 expression and partially restored motor deficits and neuronal loss in YAPGFAP-CKO ALS mice. Finally, activation of YAP by XMU-MP-1 upregulated β-catenin and EAAT2 expression, and partially alleviated motor deficits and neurodegeneration in ALS mice. Conclusions: These results identify an unrecognized mechanism of self-protection in degenerating neurons mediated by astrocytic YAP through Wnts/β-catenin/EAAT2 signaling to prevent glutamate excitotoxicity of neurons in ALS mice, and provide a novel drug target for ALS.">

        <tr id="As an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits remarkable contagiousness and has emerged as a critical global public health concern. In critically ill patients, virus-induced cytokine storms and resulting multi-organ failure represent significant therapeutic challenges. In our clinical observations, we identified that this hyperinflammatory state was correlated with reduced mRNA expression of both Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-Induced Protein 8-like Protein 2 (TIPE2)—an immune negative modulator—and the ferroptosis marker gene Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of these patients. Given the emerging evidence that macrophage polarization and dysfunction play pivotal roles in COVID-19 progression, we established a THP-1-derived macrophage model stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to mimic the host immune response. Our results demonstrated that TIPE2 modulates S protein-induced macrophage polarization and ferroptosis, specifically by suppressing M1 polarization associated with inflammation and encouraging M2 polarization linked to anti-inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that TIPE2 mediates critical immunomodulatory effects during the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating pathological inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients gravely affected.

This highlights the need to study the humoral immune response to better understand the pathophysiology of viral respiratory infections and improve treatments and diagnostics. This study analyzed autoantibody and acute-phase reactant profiles in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A using customized protein microarrays for sensitive and reproducible results. The findings revealed a significant increase in autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients, including those targeting calcitonin-related polypeptides, hepatocyte growth factor, or interleukin 8, compared to Influenza A patients, who showed elevated levels of selectin E and surfactant protein D. Additionally, most acute-phase reactants were higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The serological profile showed that the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain induced both IgM and IgG responses to all viral proteins, while other strains triggered an IgG response only at a later stage. Multiomics factor analysis identified key factors driving variation in COVID-19's heterogeneous disease presentation.

        <tr id="Background In sepsis, oxidative stress (OS) triggers essential adaptive responses and emerging OS-related biomarkers show potential for enhancing sepsis diagnosis and therapy. Methodology In this study, we used single-cell datasets and the OS gene set to identify immune cell types with the highest oxidative activity across different sepsis states. Differential expression genes (DEG) between “high state” cells and “low state” cells were screened. High-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA), combined with multiple machine learning methods, was used for the selection of hub genes. Expressions of hub genes were then validated. Cell–cell communication and transcription factor analysis were performed later. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting validated expression of LILRA5 in both the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model and the lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis model. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were also detected in THP-1 cells after silencing LILRA5. Results In the early stages of sepsis, oxidative activity reaches its peak, with macrophages displaying the highest OS among all cell types. Through the application of the “Quartile method”, all cells were clustered into three states based on OS activity (low, medium, and high). LILRA5, MGST1, PLBD1, and S100A9 were selected as hub genes and significantly upregulated in sepsis. LILRA5 was predominantly expressed in macrophages and was highly expressed in the early stage of macrophage. Specifically, LILRA5+ macrophages exhibit the strongest OS. LILRA5 showed a higher expression in both mouse sepsis models and the THP-1 cell after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Silencing LILRA5 resulted in a significant reduction of ROS in THP-1 cells. Conclusion In conclusion, our study has mapped the landscape of OS dynamics in sepsis and found that LILRA5+ macrophages in the early stage of sepsis exhibit the highest OS. LILRA5 emerges as a promising gene for modulating macrophage-mediated OS in sepsis.">

        <tr id="Traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits a sustained innate immune response involving both resident microglia and infiltrating peripheral immune cells. However, the influence of peripheral immune-derived signals on microglial dynamics and functional recovery remains poorly understood. We previously identified the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4 as a regulator of acute neuroinflammation following TBI. In this study, we employed bone marrow chimeric mice with hematopoietic-specific EphA4 knockout and subjected them to controlled cortical impact (CCI) to investigate the role of EphA4 in modulating acute and chronic microglial responses. Mice lacking EphA4 in hematopoietic cells exhibited reduced microglial apoptosis and proliferation at 3 days post-injury (dpi), accompanied by increased microglial sphericity at 3- and 60-days post-injury (dpi) within the injured cortex. These morphological changes coincided with enhanced spatial proximity to peripheral-derived macrophages. Behaviorally, EphA4-deficient chimeric mice demonstrated improved performance in the novel object recognition test at 3 dpi, and in the T-maze at both 60 and 90 dpi. Single-cell RNA sequencing of hippocampal tissue at 90 dpi revealed microglial subpopulations uniquely enriched in EphA4-deficient chimeric mice, with transcriptional profiles associated with leukocyte differentiation, immune regulation, hematopoiesis, and endothelial development. Together, these findings demonstrate that peripheral immune-derived EphA4 signaling influences microglial heterogeneity and negatively regulates long-term neuroimmune remodeling and functional recovery following TBI.">

        <tr id="Abstract Aging is associated with elevated levels of inflammation across tissues, a status recognized as “inflammaging.” Within the brain, microglia are the resident phagocytic immune cells that are important in both homeostatic and disease states. Aged microglia are susceptible to processes of “inflammaging,” which can include higher expression of baseline levels of inflammatory signals, decline in functional activity, and contribution to neurodegenerative processes. Information about microglial function has been gained using in vitro cell culture methods; however, most studies described previously have used microglia cultured from neonatal mice. More recent studies have used microglia cultured from young adult mice, but those using microglia from aged mice are lacking. Considering the distinct changes that come with aging and the important role of microglia in age‐related neurologic disorders, there is a need for reliable protocols for studying aged cells specifically. Here, we describe a method to culture primary microglia from aged mice. Collected brain tissue is digested using enzymatic and mechanical techniques and then cultured in specific medium that supports the continued survival and proliferation of adult and aged microglia. To confirm microglial identity, cultured cells were immunostained for microglia‐specific markers and imaged by microscopy and flow cytometry. We also compared the activation status of adult and aged microglia that were cultured versus those that were assessed directly after collection. Microglial cultures can easily be manipulated via genetic modifications or pharmacologic intervention to test specific functions. © 2025 The Author(s).

        <tr id="Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) represents a severe complication of cranial radiotherapy, substantially diminishing patients’ quality of life. Unlike conventional brain injuries, RIBI evokes a unique chronic neuroinflammatory response that notably aggravates neurodegenerative processes. Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms related to neuroinflammation, the specific and precise mechanisms that regulate neuroinflammation in RIBI and its associated toxicological effects remain largely unclear. Additionally, targeted neuroprotective strategies for RIBI are currently lacking. In this study, we systematically characterized the pathophysiology of RIBI using zebrafish (larvae/adults) and murine models. We established direct associations between neuronal damage and cognitive-behavioral deficits. Mechanistically, we proposed a ROS-mitochondrial-immune axis. Specifically, radiation-induced ROS lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in the leakage of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol. This, in turn, activated the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby driving persistent microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we engineered a dual-function nanotherapeutic agent, Pep-Cu5.4O@H151. This agent integrates ultrasmall copper-based nanozymes (Cu5.4O) for ROS scavenging and H151 (a STING inhibitor) and is conjugated with peptides that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and target microglia. This nanoplatform exhibited excellent synergistic therapeutic efficacy by simultaneously neutralizing oxidative stress and blocking inflammatory cascades. Our research provided an in-depth analysis of radiation-induced neurotoxicity, clarifying the crucial ROS-mitochondrial-immune axis. Moreover, we have developed a precise therapeutic strategy on the basis of this mechanism.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2029 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which enters the human body via the respiratory route and can infect nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, goblet cells, hair cells, pneumocytes, etc. COVID-19 caused the worst pandemic in centuries. SARS-CoV-2, once in the airway tree, penetrates the host cells and causes a strong inflammatory reaction by a rapid response of the innate immune system, in particular by activation of macrophages and dendritic cells that recognize the virus component proteins as non-self. Cells of the immune system secrete type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines, initiating an antiviral state in neighboring cells and in the intercellular connective matrix, recruiting new immune mediators and new cells to the site of infection. This rapid response is crucial for limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we aimed at highlighting some microscopic aspects of the acute inflammatory reaction in the lung for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis of the histological pieces suggested that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction begins with the accumulation of immune cells in the interalveolar septa in response to viral insult, congestion of pulmonary vessels with increased blood volume in pulmonary vessels, followed by the presence of alveolar exudate, which reduces the area of hematosis and triggers respiratory symptoms. The inflammatory reaction was totally inhomogeneous, varying widely from patient to patient and even within the same patient, probably depending on the immune status, age or comorbidities. It presented two phases, a predominantly exudative phase (EP) and a predominantly proliferative phase (PP), intricately intertwined; sometimes, on the same histopathological piece, we identified both areas of incipient inflammatory reaction (EP) and a very intense reaction in the PP, suggesting that the pulmonary inflammatory reaction developed rapidly. The inflammatory infiltrate had a complex composition: neutrophilic leukocytes, macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The most abundant inflammatory cells were macrophages, both in the EP and PP. The use of anti-interleukin (IL) antibodies showed that ILs are mainly produced by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, but also by conjunctival cells (fibroblasts).">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

Its involvement in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders is well documented. However, the role of microglia in cerebral malaria, a disease associated with high mortality and long-term neurological sequelae, remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized the classical model of experimental cerebral malaria (Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected C57BL/6 mice) to investigate the dynamics and response of resident brain cell populations, particularly microglia, and the influx of other leukocytes during the development of experimental cerebral malaria. By employing flow cytometry and established markers for different leukocyte populations, we were able to discern and document an increase in the number of Ly6C+ T cells (CD45hiCD11b-CD3+ cells), inflammatory monocytes (CD45hiCD11b+TMEM119-CD206- cells), resident macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+TMEM119-CD206+ cells), and microglia (CD45lowCD11b+ TMEM119+CD206- cells) following infection. Moreover, our ex vivo analysis demonstrated an increment in the overall number of inflammatory monocytes, resident macrophages and microglia expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in addition to those producing interleukin-1β or TNF. These findings highlight the pronounced reactivity of microglia in experimental cerebral malaria and provide valuable information on cell dynamics and immune responses in the brain.">

        <tr id="The long-term pulmonary sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections reflect infection severity, innate and adaptive immunity, and respiratory epithelial repair. This study investigated the acute and reparative responses as a function of age and sex in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures utilizing a 14-day SARS-CoV-2 infection protocol. SARS-CoV-2 infection peaked at 3 days post-infection (dpi) with an ~ 2 log titer suppression at 14 dpi. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced interferon, interferon-induced gene, and cell damage responses. No age- or sex-dependent effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected. Airway epithelia repaired to an abnormal mucus metaplastic/inflammatory state that reflected potentially beneficial and adverse consequences at 14 dpi. Repair processes were infection severity-dependent, not sex-dependent, and were more robust in young donor cultures. Analyses of long-COVID subjects with persistent pulmonary fibrosis or persistent bronchitic airway diseases exhibited expression of HBE 14 dpi failed repair gene signatures, including ISG gene signatures. Human airway epithelial repair post-SARS-CoV-2 is prolonged and incomplete in vitro over 14 days, and persistently abnormal repair may contribute to phenotypes of people with long-COVID pulmonary syndrome.">

        <tr id="Murine microglia exhibit rapid self-renewal upon removal from the postnatal brain. However, the signaling pathways that regulate microglial repopulation remain largely unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we depleted microglia from mixed glial cultures using anti-CD11b magnetic particles and cultured them for 4 weeks to monitor their repopulation ability in vitro. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry revealed that anti-CD11b bead treatment effectively eliminated >95% of microglia in mixed glial cultures. Following removal, the number of CX3CR1-positive microglia gradually increased; when a specific threshold was reached, repopulation ceased without any discernable rise in cell death. Cell cycle and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation assays suggested the active proliferation of repopulating microglia at d7. Time-lapse imaging demonstrated post-removal division of microglia. Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B signaling was identified as crucial for microglial repopulation, as pharmacological inhibition or neutralization of the pathway significantly abrogated repopulation. Transwell cocultures revealed that resident microglia competitively inhibited microglial proliferation probably through contact inhibition. This in vitro microglial removal system provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying microglial proliferation.">

        <tr id="Despite targeting mainly the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 disrupts T cell homeostasis in ways that may explain both acute lethality and long-term immunological consequences. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the T-cell-mediated chain of immunity and formation of TCR via TREC assessment in COVID-19 and long COVID (LC). For this study, we collected 231 blood samples taken from patients with acute COVID-19 (n = 71), convalescents (n = 51), people diagnosed with LC (n = 63), and healthy volunteers (n = 46). With flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (i.e., naïve, central and effector memory cells (CM and EM), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1, and subpopulations of effector cells (pE1, pE2, effector cells)). Additionally, we measured TREC levels. We found distinct changes in immune cell distribution—whilst distribution of major subpopulations of T cells was similar between cohorts, we noted that COVID-19 was associated with a decrease in naïve Th and CTLs, an increase in Th2/Tc2 lymphocyte polarization, an increase in CM cells, and a decrease in effector memory cells 1,3, and TEMRA cells. LC was associated with naïve CTL increase, polarization towards Th2 population, and a decrease in Tc1, Tc2, Em2, 3, 4 cells. We also noted TREC correlating with naïve cells subpopulations. Our findings suggest ongoing immune dysregulation, possibly driven by persistent antigen exposure or tissue migration of effector cells. The positive correlation between TREC levels and naïve T cells in LC patients points to residual thymic activity. The observed Th2/Th17 bias supports the hypothesis that LC involves autoimmune mechanisms, potentially driven by molecular mimicry or loss of immune tolerance.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been linked to several neurological symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying virus-induced neuroinflammation are not well identified. For example, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain has not been addressed, in spite of its importance in dopaminergic signalling and neurodegenerative abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to understand the SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory response in the SNpc region of the brain. We inoculated (intranasally) transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 under control of the human keratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE-2 mice) with a 4×103 TCID50 (mild) dose of SARS-CoV-2. Ten days post-inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the SNpc of mice, along with increased levels of IL-1β, B1R and ADAM17, and reduced microglial/macrophage occurrence. miR-330-5p expression was significantly reduced in virus-positive SNpc tissue. Luciferase reporter assays supported ADAM17 as a direct target of miR-330-5p. There was no significant difference in miR-330-5p expression levels in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice compared to control mice, demonstrating a crucial role for SARS-CoV-2-induced miR-330-5p in brain pathology. Our study uncovers for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the SNpc and downregulate miR-330-5p expression levels, causing an enhanced ADAM17 expression and possible neuroinflammatory signalling. The results implicate miR-330-5p as a prospective therapeutic target for alleviating midbrain inflammation associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Decapodiridovirus litopenaeus1 (DIV1) is a highly pathogenic virus threatening crustacean aquaculture. Hemocytes, the primary immune cells in shrimp, play crucial roles in host defense, yet their transcriptional heterogeneity and differentiation dynamics under viral infection remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize hemocyte subpopulations in Macrobrachium rosenbergii before and after DIV1 infection at single-cell resolution. We identified 12 distinct hemocyte clusters with unique molecular signatures. DIV1 infection induced significant shifts in hemocyte composition, with clusters 0, 5, 6, and 8 expanding, while clusters 9 and 10 exhibited resistance. Clusters 0, 5, and 8 were highly susceptible, showing elevated viral gene expression. Pseudo-time analysis revealed that DIV1 accelerates hemocyte differentiation, driving prohemocytes and semi-granulocytes toward terminally differentiated granulocytes and hyalinocytes, particularly the immune-active HC4 subpopulation. Functional enrichment analysis showed that susceptible hemocytes were associated with viral processes, oxidative stress, and phagocytosis, while resistant clusters exhibited distinct immune signatures. Furthermore, knockdown experiments confirmed the antiviral roles of PPO2, RAB11B, LAMP1, and Dorsal, as their silencing led to increased viral loads, higher major capsid protein (MCP) levels, and reduced shrimp survival. Taken together, our study provides the first single-cell resolution atlas of shrimp hemocytes under DIV1 infection, revealing their transcriptional heterogeneity, differentiation trajectories, and immune responses. These findings offer novel insights into shrimp antiviral immunity and lay the foundation for disease-resistant breeding and immunostimulatory strategies in aquaculture. IMPORTANCE DIV1 is a highly pathogenic virus threatening crustacean aquaculture, causing severe economic losses. Hemocytes in shrimp play crucial roles in antiviral defense, yet their diversity, differentiation, and responses to viral infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to comprehensively characterize hemocyte subpopulations in Macrobrachium rosenbergii before and after DIV1 infection. We identified 12 transcriptionally distinct hemocyte clusters and revealed significant changes in hemocyte composition following infection. Notably, we discovered that specific clusters (0, 5, and 8) were highly susceptible to DIV1, while others (9 and 10) exhibited resistance. Additionally, we reconstructed hemocyte differentiation trajectories and found that DIV1 infection drives hematopoiesis, accelerating the transition of progenitor cells into terminally differentiated immune-active hemocytes. Functional analysis highlighted key antiviral effectors, including PPO2, RAB11B, LAMP1, and Dorsal. These findings provide novel insights into shrimp antiviral immunity and viral pathogenesis, offering potential targets for disease-resistant breeding and immunostimulatory interventions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Central nervous system (CNS) diseases, a leading cause of global disability and mortality, encompass a wide range of brain disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and so on. These diseases are characterized by dynamic cellular heterogeneity and disrupted intercellular crosstalk, yet their molecular drivers remain incompletely resolved. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) dissects transcriptional diversity at cellular resolution, while spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps niche‐specific interactions within tissue architecture—complementary approaches that have revealed disease‐associated subpopulations, neural–glial communication, and microenvironmental remodeling. However, standalone omics layers inadequately capture the genetic, epigenetic, and functional cascades underlying CNS pathologies. Here, we highlight the transformative potential of integrating scRNA‐seq and ST with multiomic profiling to delineate spatially orchestrated molecular networks. Such multiomic convergence enables systematic deconstruction of molecular mechanisms and intercellular communication across disease progression. By correlating these signatures with clinical phenotypes, this strategy accelerates biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and therapeutic target identification. We further discuss challenges in data harmonization, subcellular spatial resolution, and computational scalability that must be addressed to realize personalized CNS medicine. This synthesis advocates for interdisciplinary frameworks to translate multiomic insights into mechanistically grounded diagnostics and therapies, ultimately bridging the gap between molecular discovery and precision clinical intervention.">

        <tr id="Background Peripheral activated T cells cross the blood–brain barrier, partake in neuroinflammation, and induce dopaminergic neuron degeneration through characteristics such as cell adhesion and immune response in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Metabolic activity, which can regulate and be regulated by cellular signaling pathways, has a profound impact on the differentiation and function of T cells. However, a characterization of T-cell metabolic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution in PD is still lacking. Here, combining metabolic gene expression profiling and pathway activity algorithm, we studied the metabolic programs in PD-associated T cells. Results Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) with adhesive properties dominated the proportion in PD patients based on the distribution of T cell types at single-cell resolution. The unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthetic process was found to be the pivotal contributor to CTLs’ metabolic features distinct from other cell types. Meanwhile, the upregulation of UFA biosynthetic process strongly correlated with immunologic activity in CTLs. Additionally, we revealed that fatty acid desaturases became the critical factor in determining CTLs’ metabolic heterogeneity according to the differentiation of T cell lineage and the high expression of metabolic genes in PD. Subsequent fatty acid desaturases adjustments mediated crosstalk with CTLs’ immunity, suggesting a potential target for regulating neuroinflammation in PD condition. Conclusions This analysis decoded the activation of T cells from another perspective, where PD-associated CTLs were metabolically reprogrammed to interact with the immune system, for in-depth insights into the immune characteristics of PD.

        <tr id="Background: Bone marrow serves as a source and reservoir of immune cells and plays a critical role in central nervous system diseases. Nociceptive neurons are widely distributed in the bone marrow, but their post-infarction changes and immunological functions remain largely unexplored. Methods: A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and human skull bone marrow samples from stroke patients were analyzed. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling was manipulated via receptor knockout and targeted nanoparticle delivery. Immune responses were evaluated primarily through flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: Activation of nociceptive neurons after cerebral infarction promoted myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and increased infiltration of myeloid cells into brain tissue, resulting in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. This regulatory mechanism was mediated by CGRP, which enhanced the proliferation and mobilization of downstream myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), ultimately improving stroke outcomes. To overcome the hypotensive side effects of CGRP, we employed aged neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles for its targeted delivery to bone marrow, achieving sustained release and enhanced efficacy. Conclusion: Nociceptive neurons critically modulate post-stroke bone marrow immune responses by releasing CGRP and activating MDSC. Targeted CGRP delivery to bone marrow represents a promising strategy to suppress neuroinflammation and improve neurological recovery after cerebral infarction.">

        <tr id="Background Respiratory microbiome alterations, coinfections, and virus intrahost evolution are of great interest in persistently viable SARS-CoV-2 infections in the context of antiviral treatment and immune response. However, samples before, during, and after infection are seldom available to researchers. Therefore, there has been a significant lack of opportunities to comprehensively study microbiota homeostasis, coinfections, and virus intra-host evolution on the consensus and minor variants scale in response to antiviral treatments and patient immune response. Case presentation A 63-year-old female patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received multiple treatments for SARS-CoV-2 that remained active 169 days. Together, 32 respiratory and 19 serum samples were collected before, during, and after (− 398 to 233 days) COVID-19. Subsets were selected for virus viability testing by culture (20) and subgenomic (sg) RNA (20) measurement, intra-host evolution assessment (18), microbiome composition analysis (28), and coinfection identification (11). IgA/IgG and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured 19 times throughout the infection. SARSCoV-2 lineage XBB.1.16.11 persisted and remained viable until 116 days post infection (PI) regardless of treatments. No sgRNA marker tested was suitable for virus viability prediction. IgG/IgA antibodies first appeared after 38 days, but the virus persisted regardless of multiple plasma treatments before neutralizing antibodies appeared (100 days PI) and finally cleared the virus 116 days PI. Consensus-level mutations fluctuated around 102.7 ± 4.0, and minor variants increased from six to 61 with a mutation rate of 4.9 × 10−3 per site per year, with the highest average number of mutations per gene length in S and E (0.013) with surges after every antiviral treatment. The transversion/transition ratio increased from 0.50 (day 0) to 0.57 (day 24) with a steady decrease to 0.48 (day 147). Mutational signature analysis showed dominance of C > T substitutions consistent with APOBEC antiviral enzyme activity. Upper respiratory microbiota showed three distinct profiles with varying α-/β-diversity and an association of Staphylococcus spp. with COVID-19. Conclusions These findings further elucidate the dynamics of intra-host viral evolution and complexities of virus clearance in individuals with hematological malignancies and highlight the impact of antiviral treatments on the potential of virus variants emergence in longitudinally infectious patients due to delayed immune response.

Neurological symptoms associated with long COVID include anxiety, depression, and memory impairment. However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Using golden hamsters as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persistently infect the brain, as viral RNA and replicative virus are detected in the brainstem 80 days after the initial infection. Infected hamsters exhibit a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, characterized by overexpression of innate immunity genes, and altered expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, in energy metabolism, and in proteostasis. These infected animals exhibit persistent depression-like behavior, impaired short-term memory, and late-onset signs of anxiety. Finally, we provide evidence that viral and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, contributing to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.">

        <tr id="Both bacterial and viral infections can trigger an overwhelming host response, leading to immunopathology and organ dysfunction. Multiple studies have reported dysregulated myeloid cell states in patients with bacterial sepsis or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their relevance to viral infections other than COVID-19, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a multi-cohort analysis of single cell and bulk transcriptomic data from 1845 patients across 25 studies. Our meta-analysis revealed a conserved severity-associated gene signature pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM) and increased IL1R2 expression in monocytes and neutrophils from patients with bacterial sepsis, COVID-19, and influenza. Analysis of tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients showed that IL-6 signaling blockade partially reduces this signature and results in a compensatory increase in G-CSF. To validate the role of these cytokines in vivo, we used a mouse model of influenza infection that recapitulates severity-associated increases in IL1R2+ monocytes and IL1R2hi neutrophils, and demonstrate that combined IL-6 and G-CSF blockade inhibits their production. Our study demonstrates the cooperative role of G-CSF and IL-6 in driving the production of severity-associated IL1R2+ myeloid cells and highlights the link between myeloid dysregulation and tissue injury during severe infection.">

        <tr id="Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a systemic disease caused by mutations in either the TSC1 (encoding hamartin) or TSC2 (encoding tuberin) gene, with mutations in the TSC2 gene potentially leading to more severe clinical symptoms. Neurological symptoms are a common clinical manifestation of TSC, and neuroinflammation is thought to play an important role. Glial cells are a major source of neuroinflammation, but whether microglia are involved in the activation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in TSC patients remains unclear. We used a transcriptome sequencing dataset for bioinformatics analysis to explore the differences in the expression of microglial inflammasome-associated hub genes. TSC2 knockdown (TSC2 KD) microglia (HMC3 cell line) were generated by lentivirus, and the expression of inflammasome-associated hub genes, microglial activation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were verified. In addition, experiments were performed to explore the regulatory effects of rapamycin. Bioinformatics analysis identified a total of eight inflammasome-associated hub genes. By detecting GFP fluorescence, TSC2 mRNA, TSC2 protein expression, and the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR)/mTOR, we confirmed that the TSC2 KD microglia model was successfully established. Compared with the control group, the TSC2 KD group presented higher mRNA levels and fluorescence intensities of microglia AIF1 and CD68, as well as greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Eight inflammasome-associated hub gene mRNA assays revealed that the expression of the NLRP3 and IL1B genes was increased. Compared with the control group, the TSC2 KD group presented increased levels of NLRP3 and Pro-IL-1β proteins in cells and Cleaved-Caspase 1 and Cleaved-IL-1β proteins in the supernatant, suggesting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Rapamycin intervention alleviated these changes, demonstrating that the TSC2 gene regulation of microglial activation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation are correlated with mTOR phosphorylation. In conclusion, microglia are activated in TSC patients and participate in the NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammatory response, and rapamycin treatment can alleviate these changes.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 7 million deaths, but its legacy extends beyond mortality. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces immune alterations that persist post-recovery, manifesting not only in long COVID (LC) but also in healthy individuals. Cytokines serve as critical orchestrators of these processes. The goal of this study is to investigate post-pandemic immune remodeling through cytokine assessment in both patients with LC and healthy donor, and to compare the post-pandemic population with pre-pandemic controls to find changes in the immune responses and cytokine profiles. A panel of 47 immune mediators (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) was measured with the MAGPIX multiplex analysis. LC was characterized by an increase in IL-7, IL-8, IL-17F, IL-18, EGF, FGF-2, PDGF-AA, sCD40L, and MCP-3 and a decrease in IL-4, IL-13, IL-22, IL-27, and FLT-3L. Comparing post-pandemic recovered individuals with pre-pandemic healthy cohort, we saw an upregulation of IL-13 and MCP-3 and a downregulation of MDC, M-CSF, IL-12, and IL-17F. While LC is characterized by persistent immune imbalance—particularly in cytokine networks—our data emphasize the critical need to study healthy donors in both pre- and post-pandemic eras when analyzing and interpreting these changes.">

Here, we investigated H1N1-induced liver damage and its potential mechanisms using a BALB/c mouse infection model. Pathological examination and serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were assessed. Messenger ribonucleic acid-sequence was used to analyze the transcriptomic changes in tissues. Multiple inflammatory cytokines in tissues and inflammatory cells in the blood were detected on the fifth day post-infection. Our results showed that H1N1 infection caused significant liver pathology and elevated serum AST/ALT levels. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in liver gene expression profiles following H1N1 infection, particularly in genes associated with inflammatory responses, including those involved in monocyte adhesion/activation and neutrophil/macrophage infiltration. Marked increases in inflammatory mediators were observed in lungs, serum, and liver, accompanied by systemic changes in circulating inflammatory cells, indicating H1N1 triggered a robust systemic inflammatory response. These findings suggest that H1N1-induced liver damage may be associated with the systemic inflammatory response induced by H1N1 and changes in liver gene regulation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a progressive decline in dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra (SN). Although its underlying cause has yet to be fully elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes substantially to disease development. Treatment strategies targeting neuroinflammation could improve PD outcomes. Monocyte-derived tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) modulate immune responses and induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) during various inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying tolDC-mediated immunoregulation in PD remain unclear.


METHODS
We investigated the immune modulatory role of tolDCs by analyzing gene expression patterns and identified that the C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (Clec5a) was highly induced in tolDCs. To assess its function, we generated Clec5a-knockdown tolDCs and measured cytokine production, including interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6, forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3)+ Treg induction, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling activity. Furthermore, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of Clec5a-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Dopaminergic neuron survival, α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, neuroinflammatory markers, and locomotor behavior were analyzed following DC administration.


RESULTS
Clec5a-knockdown tolDCs exhibited reduced immunomodulatory function and IL-10 levels but enhanced IL-6 levels. In addition, these cells induced fewer Foxp3+ Tregs and showed significantly enhanced NF-κB signaling activity. In the MPTP-induced PD model, administration of Clec5a-expressing DCs ameliorated dopaminergic neuron loss and α-syn accumulation. Furthermore, Clec5a-expressing DCs reduced the number of CD45highCD11b+CD86+ macrophages in the brain, reduced brain inflammatory cytokine expression, and improved locomotor activity.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that Clec5a plays a critical role in the immunomodulatory function of tolDCs. The administration of Clec5a-expressing DCs effectively reduced neuroinflammation and protected dopaminergic neurons in an MPTP-induced PD model. Therefore, Clec5a-expressing tolDCs may demonstrate therapeutic potential by managing PD symptoms by suppressing inflammatory responses associated with neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Introduction COVID-19 is associated with an inflammatory pathophysiology and, when associated with chronic diseases, can trigger severe infection and increase death risk. Irisin, a hormone produced by skeletal muscle during physical activity, has demonstrated therapeutic effects against metabolic disorders and exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. There is great interest in investigating irisin’s influence on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells. The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of irisin in viral infection in monolayers (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures of human subcutaneous adipocytes infected with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PV). Materials and methods Preadipocytes were cultured to maturity in 2D or 3D conditions and divided into four groups: Group 1: adipocytes with no treatment; Group 2: adipocytes optimized for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression; Group 3: adipocytes optimized for ACE2 expression, and then exposed to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (ACE2+PV); and Group 4: adipocytes treated with irisin 20 nM for 24 h, optimized for ACE2 expression and exposed to PV (ACE2+I+PV). Fluorescence levels of SARS-CoV-2 PV and ACE2 were measured to investigate cell infection; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity to investigate cytotoxicity; and malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonylation to assess oxidative stress levels. Results and discussion Irisin significantly reduced viral particle (PV) capture in 2D and 3D conditions. In addition, irisin decreased LDH release, MDA, and protein carbonylation levels, both in 2D and 3D conditions. Conclusion The results indicate irisin as a promising therapeutic target against COVID-19 pathophysiology by reducing viral entry into adipose cells as well as reducing cytotoxicity and oxidative stress indicators.">

At least 10% of individuals with a previous infection may develop long COVID, which affects their ability to perform daily functions and work. Despite its severity and widespread impact, this multisystemic condition remains poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of the complement system, a key component of the innate immune response, may contribute to the pathogenesis of long COVID, particularly in connection with coagulation, inflammation, and vascular injury.

        <tr id="Abstract Neonates have increased vulnerability to life-threatening infections due to the distinct immune landscape. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a key component of this immune profile that we have previously shown to be elevated in both newborn humans and mice. IL-27 continues to increase in the serum and tissues consistent with poor outcomes during gram-negative neonatal bacterial sepsis. Presently, we dissected the IL-27 producer profile at a single-cell level using IL-27p28eGFP reporter mice in our previously established model of neonatal sepsis with luciferase-expressing K1-encapsulated Escherichia coli. Whole animal imaging regionally highlighted the spleen, liver, and lungs as key infection sites by bacterial luminescence. Flow cytometry showed that IL-27 producers increased significantly in the liver with infection and were predominantly F4/80+ and CD11b+ with subpopulations that emerged expressing additional markers. This information paired with single-cell RNA sequencing further identified the most robust populations as monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and Kupffer cells followed by smaller populations of dendritic cells and neutrophils. The transcriptome demonstrated a diverse range of functionality amongst populations that included differential expression of genes implicated in bactericidal, metabolic, and inflammatory changes. Collectively, the transcriptome of IL-27 producers from the livers of infected animals suggests an uncoordinated mix of inflammatory and suppressive activity that may contribute to immune dysregulation characteristic of sepsis. Together, this work provides previously undescribed insight into the details of IL-27 producers during early-life infection. This further provides essential information needed to support IL-27 as a therapeutic target for neonatal bacterial sepsis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Many SARS‐CoV‐2 patients experience chronic pulmonary symptoms and long‐term inflammation despite viral clearance. While these clinical manifestations have been linked to the dysregulation of the adaptive immune response, the underlying immunopathology remains poorly understood due to a lack of suitable animal models. To investigate long‐term pulmonary consequences of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, we used a genetic cross of 129 mice and C57BL/6 (B6)‐K18‐hACE2 transgene mice, a model previously shown to survive infection. 129xB6‐K18‐hACE2 mice or littermate controls were infected with a low dose (5 × 102 PFU) of ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2. Complete viral clearance and full recovery from weight loss occurred by day 8 post‐infection. However, prolonged inflammation in the lung and airways persisted up to day 28 post‐infection and was associated with the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, particularly CD8+ effector T cells. This model may therefore prove valuable for further understanding of drivers of long‐term lung inflammation and for testing therapeutic strategies and clinically relevant interventions that can target long‐term pulmonary inflammation following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has converged with the HIV epidemic. Although immunocompromised patients show an elevated risk of death due to COVID-19 compared to HIV infection, the impact remains contradictory. One reason could be the use of antiretroviral therapy (ARV). Patients with HIV receiving ARV, such as tenofovir (TDF), have fewer symptoms of COVID-19. In mice, bleomycin (BLM) induces acute lung injury, resulting in an acute inflammatory response similar to the cytokine storm and lung damage observed in COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the preventive role of TDF administration prior to BLM administration. A total of 64 eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, France), both male and female, were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n = 8 per sex per group): (i) oral TDF administered in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) of saline on day 7 (TDF); (ii) oral TDF in drinking water from day 0 to day 7, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (TDF-BLM); (iii) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of saline on day 7 (SAL); and (iv) regular drinking water throughout the experiment, followed by OA of bleomycin on day 7 (BLM). Animals were euthanized 72 h after OA (day 10), and serum and lung tissues were collected for analysis. TDF-BLM lungs showed significantly reduced bronchioalveolar lavage fluid total cell counts, specifically reduced macrophages and neutrophils counts, but an increased presence of minority lymphocytes. TDF downregulated BLM-induced levels of Il1β, Il6, TNFα, and Tgfβ mRNA. Preventive treatment with TDF counteracted BLM-induced alveolar and bronchiolar cell damage. Male mice showed more severe symptoms after BLM administration for most parameters, and the preventive action of TDF was similar in both sexes. Preventive TDF administration partially counteracted BLM-induced acute lung injury. These findings support epidemiological observations suggesting a potential benefit of TDF as a prophylactic therapy against COVID-19, at least in HIV-infected patients.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause skeletal muscle, myocardial, and gastrointestinal lesions. However, it is currently unclear whether these lesions are caused directly by viral infection or indirectly after infection and whether there are differences between different animal models. Here, we first compared the pathological changes of skeletal muscle, myocardium, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle of different COVID-19 animal models (rhesus monkey, hamster, ferret, hACE2 transgenic mice, hACE2-K18 transgenic mice, mink, and cat), and analyzed the possible mechanism of pathological changes. Within 5-7 days of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the three types of muscles in these models were all damaged and inflammatory response to varying degrees, and infiltrating inflammatory cells and factors mainly included CD4T, CD8T cells, macrophages, a small amount of B cells, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and so on. Among them, the pathological changes of the three muscle tissues in the rhesus monkey model were the most significant and closely related to clinical manifestations. It was determined that SARS-CoV-2 can infect these three types of muscles through in situ hybridization and electron microscopy analysis. Therefore, the performance of muscle lesions in each model was not completely consistent and may be related to multiple factors after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including animal species, direct virus invasion, systemic inflammation after infection, and immune status of the body. This study provides a foundation for selecting models to study muscle lesion mechanisms and treatment strategies, highlighting the need for clinical attention to muscle tissue involvement in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Systemic immune changes have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but precise mechanisms and cellular targets remain unknown. Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation is another major pathophysiological event in ALS, but it remains unclear whether immune system dysregulation contributes to this process. Here, we report leukocyte and macrophage infiltration in ALS patient-derived skeletal muscle biopsies. Immune cell infiltration was replicated across the hTDP-43, TDP-43A315T (male only) and TDP-43M337V mouse models, occurring from pre-symptomatic stages and targeted to NMJ-enriched muscle regions. Proteomic analysis implicated the CCL2-CCR2 axis as a driving factor. CCL2+ cells were enriched around NMJs in hTDP-43 mice, and in ALS patient skeletal muscle. Local treatment with CCL2-neutralising antibodies or normal IgG antibodies in hTDP-43 mice reduced leukocyte infiltration and ameliorated NMJ denervation. These results demonstrate that the CCL2-CCR2 axis drives immune cell infiltration targeting NMJs in ALS, identifying a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention to prevent NMJ denervation.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, spread rapidly across the globe in 2020, with most countries experiencing two distinct waves of infection. In Brazil, the second wave was marked by the emergence of the P.1 (Gamma) variant, which disproportionately affected younger individuals and was associated with increased mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile and post mortem histopathological lung findings, correlate them with laboratory results, and compare the first and second waves of COVID-19. To investigate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we performed immunohistochemistry for citrullinated histone H3 (cit-H3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Our cohort included patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a single center in southern Brazil. The study included 42 patients, 24 from the first wave and 18 from the second, who died between March 2020 and August 2021. Laboratory data included complete blood counts and D-dimer levels. Histopathological analyses were conducted using H&E-stained slides and reviewed independently by two blinded pathologists. MPO and cit-H3 immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate NETs markers. All cases exhibited varying degrees of inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), with frequent microvascular thrombi. Neutrophilic infiltration was significantly higher in the second wave. Additionally, cases with intense neutrophilic infiltration showed a stronger association with thrombosis. NETs were identified in 10 cases. No significant correlation was found between histopathological findings, NETs, and laboratory blood count results. The histopathological findings were consistent with those reported globally. The second wave of COVID-19 showed higher neutrophilic infiltrate in the lung tissue. Neutrophils play a key role in the inflammatory response and NET formation might indicate an increased risk of mortality. Further studies can consider NET-targeted therapies as potential strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

        <tr id="The pathology of Parkinson’s disease is defined by α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation into neuronal Lewy bodies, which may lead to chronic neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Misfolded α-syn activates Toll-like receptor signaling in microglia, leading to downstream activation of NF-κB and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines recruit pro-inflammatory myeloid cells from circulation, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation. Thus, reducing microglial activation and myeloid cell infiltration has the potential to reduce neuroinflammation and PD pathology. Here, we investigated a targeted immunomodulatory strategy using LA1, a novel, small-molecule agonist of CD11b, a β2 integrin receptor highly and selectively expressed on myeloid cells and microglia. CD11b has key roles in cell adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. Previous work has demonstrated that CD11b agonism via LA1 transiently enhances integrin-mediated adhesion that limits immune cell transmigration and tissue infiltration. CD11b agonism also suppresses TLR-driven inflammatory signaling and myeloid cell activation. To evaluate its efficacy in vivo, we utilized pre-clinical Parkinson’s disease model by stereotaxically delivering AAV2-SYN to induce α-synuclein overexpression in the murine midbrain. Mice were treated with oral LA1 for four or eight weeks and analyzed. LA1 treatment significantly reduced microglial activation and decreased brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells, thereby attenuating α-synuclein-induced neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that CD11b agonism may offer a dual-action therapeutic approach in Parkinson’s disease by dampening pro-inflammatory responses by central and peripheral myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability across all age groups worldwide. After primary mechanical head injury, a cascade of molecular changes and immunological responses occur that are necessary for supporting tissue repair but also exacerbate the secondary loss of tissue caused by excessive neuroinflammation. To date, there are no targeted treatments that ameliorate the pathological neuroinflammation that is responsible for propagating secondary injury after TBI. Recent works have highlighted the adaptive immune system's response to TBI, with mounting evidence suggesting that T cells play a critical yet understudied role in propagating secondary injury while also potentially supporting reparative processes. Objectives We critically review the current literature to discuss the diverse functionality of T cells in TBI including the temporospatial characteristics of their response, mechanisms of their activation, and their contributions to the overall neuroinflammatory profile. Consideration is given for additional pathological factors that may further alter these properties. We additionally summarize previous reports of therapeutic T cell modulation in this setting and identify approaches warranting additional investigation. Finally, we discuss major gaps in the existing literature and recommend future research perspectives. Conclusion Evidence suggests several aspects of the T cell response to TBI may serve as beneficial therapeutic targets for limiting secondary injury. Additional translational investigations are warranted and may support the development of effective therapeutic strategies for treating patients post‐head trauma.">

        <tr id="Viral and bacterial lung infections place a significant burden on public health. Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican’s potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host’s immune response to lung infection. However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

However, current disease-modifying therapies demonstrate limited efficacy in addressing progressive disease subtypes, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we systematically review the neuroimmune interactions underlying the pathogenesis of MS, with a focus on three key aspects: the immune niche, immune cell types, and cell-based therapies. We first discuss the evolution of brain-immune concepts, from early notions of immune privilege to modern understandings of brain-border immune niches (meninges, choroid plexus, and perivascular spaces). These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes. Furthermore, we highlight emerging MS immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T regimens, mesenchymal stem cell interventions, microbiome modulation, and nanodelivery systems, which strategically target mechanistic nodes spanning neuroimmune niche regulation, inflammatory cascade blockade, and CNS neurorestorative capacities.">

        <tr id="Vasculitis and vascular injury are induced in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, suggesting an association between multi-organ failure and sequelae. Vascular endothelial dysfunction induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disrupts vascular barrier function, activates coagulation pathways, and induces extravasation of inflammatory cells. In addition to employing standard anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents, using treatments that stabilize and protect blood vessels following SARS-CoV-2 infection is a potentially effective strategy to relieve COVID-19 severity. Here, we focused on the vasoprotective effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator with diverse activities, and investigated whether it could be a novel therapeutic for COVID-19. Three-dimensional cultures of various human vascular endothelial cells that form luminal structures showed increased expression of LPA4 and entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, mimicking blood vessels in vivo. Validation using this culture system showed that LPA attenuated SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular destruction and the activation of inflammatory signaling. In experiments with infected animals, LPA administration protected blood vessels and suppressed inflammation and vascular damage in lung tissue. The activation of LPA signaling in vascular endothelial cells may be an effective therapeutic approach for mitigating vascular injury in COVID-19.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a wide range of acute and chronic disease manifestations. While most infections are mild, a significant number of patients develop severe illness marked by respiratory failure, thromboinflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, post-acute sequelae—commonly known as long-COVID—can persist for months. Recent studies have identified the emergence of diverse autoantibodies in COVID-19, including those targeting nuclear antigens, phospholipids, type I interferons, cytokines, endothelial components, and G-protein-coupled receptors. These autoantibodies are more frequently detected in patients with moderate to severe disease and have been implicated in immune dysregulation, vascular injury, and persistent symptoms. This review examines the underlying immunological mechanisms driving autoantibody production during SARS-CoV-2 infection—including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, and bystander activation—and discusses their functional roles in acute and post-acute disease. We further explore the relevance of autoantibodies in maternal–fetal immunity and comorbid conditions such as autoimmunity and cancer, and we summarize current and emerging therapeutic strategies. A comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced autoantibodies may improve risk stratification, inform clinical management, and guide the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects humans and animals and is therefore a pathogen of grave concern within a One Health framework. Identifying animal-adaptive mutations is critical to preserving One Health, as these mutations could also lead to the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in animal reservoirs with continual spillover to humans. Therefore, we sought to pair experimental evolution and epidemiological data to identify putative human- and animal-adaptive viral residues and determine their impact on replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 in both human and animal cells. We passaged SARS-CoV-2 in cells expressing human, dog, cat, mink, and white-tailed deer ACE2 and sequenced the passaged populations. In addition, we searched SARS-CoV-2 sequences for mutations following patterns of convergent evolution that were common to both human- and animal-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We identified the epidemiologically relevant Spike A222V mutation from our passaging experiment in cells expressing cat ACE2, a mutation that has also arisen independently across eight lineages of SARS-CoV-2 from human- and animal-derived sequences. To assess its impact on replication in human and animal cells, we constructed SARS-CoV-2 Spike A222V in the Wuhan-Hu-1 backbone with Spike D614G; this virus replicated similarly to the WT SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 Spike A222V demonstrated an advantage in replication in primary deer lung cells, which was not mediated by the deer ACE2 receptor. Infection via the human, dog, cat, and mink ACE2 receptor resulted in reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 Spike A222V. Our experiments identified Spike A222V as a putatively deer-adaptive mutation. Future studies should assess Spike A222V’s relevance to transmission within deer and to other animal species in contact with deer.">

Our study provides the direct evidence of angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2 (ACE2)-independent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uptake in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which is significantly enhanced in aging and triggers a proinflammatory response. We reveal a molecular pathway linking endothelial senescence to increased viral susceptibility and inflammatory pathology, explaining why aging is a major risk factor for severe COVID-19. These findings not only resolve a long-standing controversy regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection of ECs but also identify senescent ECs as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating severe COVID-19 complications.">

In contrast, some preterm infants with systemic bacterial or viral infections mounted robust CD8+, CD4+, and {gamma}{delta} T cell responses, with oligoclonal expansion, terminal differentiation, and coordinated plasma cytokine shifts that persisted well beyond resolution of infection. These findings demonstrate that different preterm comorbidities imprint the neonatal immune system in divergent ways. Longitudinal immune profiling offers a powerful tool to uncover these trajectories and identify potential targets for intervention.">

        <tr id="Immune memory was considered for decades an exclusive hallmark of the adaptive immune response. However, recent studies have revealed that innate immune cells can also ‘recall’ information of a primary insult during infection or vaccination and deploy robust antigen-agonistic immune reactivity upon secondary challenge. This de-facto innate immune memory response is designated as ‘trained immunity’. γδ T cells are unconventional T cells that possess unique immunologic features of both adaptive and innate immunity. Their immune memory responses to various bacterial and viral agents were originally described to be of an adaptive immune nature. Nevertheless, growing evidence shows that γδ T cells can also mount antigen-independent memory responses resembling trained immunity. In this review, we discuss the dual nature of immune memory responses of γδ T cells and provide insights into their important role in protection against bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections in humans and animals.">

        <tr id="Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a cascade of neuroinflammatory responses mediated by microglial activation, which significantly contributes to secondary brain damage. While triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a key inflammatory amplifier, its mechanistic role and therapeutic potential in TBI remain elusive. Thus, this study endeavored to elucidate the exact role of TREM-1 in experimental TBI. Methods A controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was established in male C57BL/6 mice to induce TBI. The temporal expression profile of TREM-1 was assessed using RNA sequencing and Western blot (WB). The TREM-1 inhibitory peptide LP17 was administered intranasally at 2 hours post-injury (hpi). Neurobehavioral assessments, histological analyses, immunofluorescence (IF), brain water content (BWC) measurement, Evans blue (EB) assays and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) were performed in this study. In vitro experiments using BV2 microglial cells were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying TREM-1-mediated inflammation. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibition was achieved using R406, and TREM-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpressing plasmids were performed to validate its role in NF-κB signaling and pyroptosis quantified using WB and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD, and group comparisons were made by two-tailed Student’s t-tests or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results TBI significantly upregulated TREM-1 expression in microglia, peaking at 3 days post-injury (dpi). Intranasal administration of the TREM-1 antagonist LP17 treatment attenuated neuroinflammation, reduced blood-brain barrier disruption, ameliorated cerebral blood flow decrease, promoted synaptic remodeling, and improved functional outcomes. Mechanistically, through its interaction with SYK, TREM-1 triggered the CARD9/NF-κB signaling and induced pyroptosis. SYK inhibition reversed these effects, confirming the necessity of the TREM-1/SYK axis in neuroinflammatory signaling. In vitro studies further demonstrated that TREM-1 overexpression enhanced SYK phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and pyroptosis, while LP17 or R406 treatment suppressed these responses. Conclusion Our finding demonstrates that TREM-1 critically mediates neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction after TBI. Pharmacological targeting of TREM-1 attenuates neuroinflammation, reduces cerebral edema, preserves blood-brain barrier integrity, and improves functional recovery. These effects are mediated through suppression of TREM-1-dependent NF-κB signaling and pyroptosis. These results highlight TREM-1 as a promising therapeutic target for TBI.">

        <tr id="Background. Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, but efforts to develop efficacious neuroprotective therapy face ongoing challenges. Efferocytosis, the phagocytic clearance of dying cells, by microglia is crucial for limiting neuroinflammation and promoting stroke resolution. Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is an inflammatory mediator which impairs macrophage bacterial phagocytosis in sepsis and radiation injury, but its role in microglial efferocytosis in ischemic stroke has not yet been studied. Results. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of ischemic stroke, we demonstrate that eCIRP is released into the cerebrospinal fluid and microglial expression of crucial efferocytic receptor MerTK decreases in tMCAO mice. CIRP deficiency significantly improved neurological deficit, MerTK expression and microglial efferocytosis in tMCAO mice. Utilizing tMCAO, hippocampal injections, and primary microglia, we show that eCIRP induces pro-inflammatory micro-RNA 155 (miR-155) via TLR4, which suppresses its target pro-efferocytic transcription factor MAF bZIP (MafB), downregulating MerTK and microglial efferocytosis. Pharmacological blockade of eCIRP–TLR4 interaction using small peptide C23 attenuates miR-155 induction, restores MerTK expression, rescues microglial efferocytosis, and improves outcomes in tMCAO mice. Conclusion. We show that eCIRP causes microglial efferocytic dysfunction in ischemic stroke via TLR4/miR-155/MafB axis. These findings uncover a previously unknown pathway through which eCIRP signaling impairs neuroprotective function in microglia and suggest that targeting eCIRP may promote functional recovery after stroke.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections. This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="As intrinsic differences in humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 between children and adults remain unclear, we improved characterisation by defining the kinetics, specificity and function of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in children (n = 146, aged 9.4 ± 4.8 years with n = 257 samples) compared to adults (n = 85, aged 39.5 ± 15.2 years with n = 122 samples). We used plasma samples from an infection and vaccination-naive cohort study with RT-PCR confirmed ancestral B.1* SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with asymptomatic or mild disease, collected in Hong Kong between March to December 2020, from acute (0–14 days post infection) to convalescent (15–206 days) timepoints. Children had significantly lower primary antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 proteins overall, leading to a less isotype switched response. While children had lower OC43 Spike and SARS-CoV-2 S2 IgG and avidity than adults, they exhibited higher avidities for SARS-CoV-2 whole Spike and Nucleocapsid, and higher levels of Spike FcγR-binding antibodies. Adults’ SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses could be derived from high avidity pre-existing cross-reactive common cold coronavirus B cell responses, whilst children appear to generate a de novo SARS-CoV-2- specific Spike and Nucleocapsid IgG with robust Fc receptor (FcR) binding ability and high avidity at a higher proportion than adults, thus their responses are more targeted and functional for SARS-CoV-2.">

However, the immunological mechanisms underlying these clinical phenotypes remain unclear. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study including 117 MS patients and 84 healthy controls (HC). Patients were stratified as NLGL (low sNfL and sGFAP), NH (high sNfL at different levels of sGFAP), and NLGH (low sNfL and high sGFAP). Percentages of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mononuclear cells, and intracellular production of cytokines by T and B cells after “in vitro” stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results We identified a common inflammatory profile present in the blood of all MS groups comprising significant increases of effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, of memory and antigen-presenting B cells, of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing interferon-gamma, interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and of B cells producing TNF-α. Additionally, the highly inflammatory NH group showed lower frequencies of different regulatory subsets (transitional B cells, PDL1+ monocytes and Treg cells) compared to HC and increased percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and of effector CD56dim NK cells. They also showed lower percentages of Treg in blood and CSF compared to the low inflammatory NLGL group, which also displayed higher frequencies of regulatory CD56dim, NKG2A+ cells. Conclusion All MS patients share increased inflammatory B and T cells, but differ in regulatory or NK subsets, which identify highly inflammatory or benign disease courses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Immune induction under B‐cell depletion is complex and far from being fully understood. Methods We investigated clinical and immunological responses after dual homologous mRNA vaccination with BNT162b2 and after booster vaccination or infection in 14 B‐cell depleted patients with inflammatory central nervous system disease in comparison to 28 healthy controls. Spike‐specific IgG were determined using ELISA and neutralizing activity by surrogate assay. Reactive T cells were flow‐cytometrically analyzed after spike‐specific and polyclonal stimulation. Reactogenicity was self‐reported using a questionnaire. Results Vaccination was well tolerated, with slightly more systemic events reported by patients. Spike‐specific antibodies were induced in all controls, but only 43% of patients with significantly lower IgG levels and reduced neutralizing capacity (p < 0.0001). In contrast, spike‐reactive T cells were induced in both groups with similar CD4 and higher CD8 T‐cell levels in patients. Functional characterization of spike‐reactive T cells revealed equally high CTLA‐4 expression in both groups, but higher proportions of polyfunctional, triple‐cytokine expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells in patients especially after the third immunization. Three patients experienced mild breakthrough infections after second vaccination. Conclusions Despite limited ability of B‐cell depleted patients to mount a humoral immune response after multiple doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 mRNA vaccination, the vaccine‐induced T‐cell response is robust, which may have implications for protection against severe disease.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel member of the Coronaviridae family. The viral genome encodes both structural proteins, such as spike, membrane, hemagglutinin, and envelope, as well as non-structural proteins that include auxiliary proteins and replicase essential for viral replication. While immunization campaigns have mitigated the spread of the virus, therapeutic interventions remain critical for managing outbreaks and preventing long-term health consequences. Despite extensive global research into the genome, structure, entry process, and replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, key aspects such as the roles of membrane lipids in viral entry, packaging, and release, as well as the metabolic alterations in infected cells, remain poorly understood. Epigenetics, the study of heritable phenotypic changes driven by genetic and non-genetic factors, plays a pivotal role in shaping host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation and acetylation, DNA and RNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA regulation, significantly influence gene expression in infected host cells. These reversible changes orchestrate the host’s antiviral responses and potentially alter susceptibility to COVID-19. This review delves into the immuno-epigenetic modifications occurring in hosts infected with SARS-CoV-2, providing insights into how these changes trigger viral replication and infection processes. By examining the current state of research on the immune-epigenetic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we highlight the mechanisms by which these modifications affect the host-viral interplay. Furthermore, we propose potential therapeutic targets within the immune-epigenetic pathways that could enhance ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms will not only provide a deeper perspective on the virus’s pathogenic strategies but also offer innovative approaches to improve therapeutic interventions. By addressing the gaps in knowledge surrounding immune-epigenetic factors, this review aims to contribute to the development of novel strategies for preventing and managing coronavirus infections and its variants.">

        <tr id="Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant became the dominant driver during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its high transmissibility and immune escape potential. Although clinical outcomes are generally mild to moderate, the inflammatory mechanisms triggered by Omicron subvariants remain poorly defined. The goal of this study was to consider both viral evolution and the host immune response by assessing plasma cytokine levels in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. Methods: A total of 115 individuals were recruited, including 40 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR. Demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data were collected. Plasma levels of IL-6, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17A were quantified using Cytometric Bead Array. Subvariant data were obtained from GISAID records and grouped into early (BA.1-lineage) and late (BA.4/BA.5-lineage) Omicron clusters. Statistical analysis included non-parametric and parametric tests, correlation matrices, and multivariate comparisons. Results: Pharyngitis, nasal discharge, cough, and headache were the most common symptoms among infected individuals. Despite no significant variation in symptom distribution across subvariants, infected patients showed higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-10, IL-4, and IL-2 compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected controls (p < 0.05). IL-4 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in early Omicron infections. No associations were observed between cytokine levels and comorbidities. A significant correlation was found between reporting fewer symptoms and having received three vaccine doses. Conclusions: Infection with Omicron subvariants elicits a strong yet balanced cytokine response. Despite genetic divergence between lineages, immune and clinical patterns remain conserved, with vaccination appearing to mitigate the symptom burden.">

        <tr id="Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) is a severe disease that occurs weeks to months after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, often occurring in children (MISC). Symptoms include high fever, rash, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Children with MISC can develop cardiovascular injury including ventricular failure, coronary artery aneurysms, or shock. Current treatment strategies for these postacute sequelae of COVID-19 primarily target the hyperinflammatory response. However, a potential role for viral spike protein translocated via zonulin-mediated trafficking from gastrointestinal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation has been suggested. Here, we report results from a phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the zonulin antagonist larazotide in 12 children with MISC with a median age of 5.7 years. Children were enrolled during hospitalization for acute MISC and were treated with adjuvant larazotide therapy four times daily for 3 weeks. Patients were monitored for 24 weeks for safety follow-up. No larazotide-related adverse events were reported. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen in blood samples correlated with inflammatory markers, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (P = 0.004) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P < 0.0001), and with gastrointestinal symptoms as assessed by the PedsQL GI symptom score (P = 0.003). Children treated with larazotide displayed faster resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, faster clearance of spike antigen, and a faster return to usual activities. Our findings suggest that larazotide treatment may be safe in children and may improve resolution of symptoms when used as an adjuvant therapy for MISC.">

        <tr id="The focal “hot spot” neuropathologies in COVID-19 infection are revealing footprints of a hidden underlying collapse of a novel ultrafast ultradian Piezo2 signaling system within the nervous system. Paradoxically, the same initiating pathophysiology may underpin the systemic findings in COVID-19 infection, namely the multiorgan SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular pathologies and brain–body-wide systemic pro-inflammatory signaling, depending on the concentration and exposure to infecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This common initiating microdamage is suggested to be the primary damage or the acquired channelopathy of the Piezo2 ion channel, leading to a principal gateway to pathophysiology. This Piezo2 channelopathy-induced neural switch could not only explain the initiation of disrupted cell–cell interactions, metabolic failure, microglial dysfunction, mitochondrial injury, glutamatergic synapse loss, inflammation and neurological states with the central involvement of the hippocampus and the medulla, but also the initiating pathophysiology without SARS-CoV-2 viral intracellular entry into neurons as well. Therefore, the impairment of the proposed Piezo2-induced quantum mechanical free-energy-stimulated ultrafast proton-coupled tunneling seems to be the principal and critical underlying COVID-19 infection-induced primary damage along the brain axes, depending on the loci of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and intracellular entry. Moreover, this initiating Piezo2 channelopathy may also explain resultant autonomic dysregulation involving the medulla, hippocampus and heart rate regulation, not to mention sleep disturbance with altered rapid eye movement sleep and cognitive deficit in the short term, and even as a consequence of long COVID. The current opinion piece aims to promote future angles of science and research in order to further elucidate the not entirely known initiating pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in long-term multiorgan complications, with the kidney being a primary target. This study aimed to characterize the long-term transcriptomic changes in the kidney following coronavirus infection using a murine model of MHV-1-induced SARS-like illness and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SPIKENET (SPK). Methods: A/J mice were infected with MHV-1. Renal tissues were collected and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis and Next Generation RNA Sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes associated with acute and chronic infection. Bioinformatic analyses, including PCA, volcano plots, and GO/KEGG pathway enrichment, were performed. A separate cohort received SPK treatment, and comparative transcriptomic profiling was conducted. Gene expression profile was further confirmed using real-time PCR. Results: Acute infection showed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Long-term MHV-1 infection led to the sustained upregulation of genes involved in muscle regeneration, cytoskeletal remodeling, and fibrotic responses. Notably, both expression and variability of SLC22 and SLC22A8, key proximal tubule transporters, were reduced, suggesting a loss of segment-specific identity. Further, SLC12A1, a critical regulator of sodium reabsorption and blood pressure, was downregulated and is associated with the onset of polyuria and hydronephrosis. SLC transporters exhibited expression patterns consistent with tubular dysfunction and inflammation. These findings suggest aberrant activation of myogenic pathways and structural proteins in renal tissues, consistent with a pro-fibrotic phenotype. In contrast, SPK treatment reversed the expression of most genes, thereby restoring the gene profiles to those observed in control mice. Conclusions: MHV-1-induced long COVID is associated with persistent transcriptional reprogramming in the kidney, indicative of chronic inflammation, cytoskeletal dysregulation, and fibrogenesis. SPK demonstrates robust therapeutic potential by normalizing these molecular signatures and preventing long-term renal damage. These findings underscore the relevance of the MHV-1 model and support further investigation of SPK as a candidate therapy for COVID-19-associated renal sequelae.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection was responsible for the pandemic COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) and caused a range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal disorders and abdominal pain, making COVID-19 a multi-organ dysfunction. It is known that the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed also in the gut, where SARS-CoV-2 could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, similarly to what has been widely described in the lung1. This case report concerns a middle-aged man admitted to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy) and tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from the infection. Due to thrombotic and hemorragic gut conditions, accompanied by severe ulceration, the patient underwent resection of a segment of ileum. Immunohistochemical analyses showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared to the non-ulcerated one2. Moreover, expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin (FN) were analyzed. VEGF expression was increased in the ulcerated ileum portion when compared with control and non-ulcerated ileum. FN staining was progressively increasing in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. By electron microscopy the microvilli alteration of brush border and of intercellular junctions were detected in the ulcerated area but not in other areas of patient’s ileum or in the control sample. The salient aspect of this study is that although the patient was declared negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the respiratory level, SPIKE and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins were still present in the ileum, concentrated in the ulcerated area and parallelled by an increased expression of vascular markers. The ultrastructural analysis gave insights on the morpho-functional effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection on the gut epithelium, indicating that the damage is not limited to vascular structures.">

        <tr id="The interleukin-2 receptor γ (IL-2Rγ, or γc) is a crucial component of several cytokine receptor complexes. Deficiencies in γc lead to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), characterized by recurrent infections due to the absence or dysfunction of T and NK cells, and nonfunctional B cells. Missense variants in the γc extracellular region are linked to atypical X-SCID with normal counts of T, B, and NK cells and less severe symptoms, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. This study describes a case of atypical X-SCID with a missense variant (c.420 A > T, p.R140S) in the γc extracellular domain, associated with recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. We found that the R140S variant leads to reduced surface expression and variably affects cytokine receptor signaling. Specifically, STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells are impaired in response to IL-7, a cytokine essential for T cell survival, proliferation and function. Notably, γcR140S predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to WT γc, which is found in acidic compartments. Despite this mislocalization, γcR140S does not trigger unfolded protein responses, and its protein stability and degradation pathways remain unaffected. Nevertheless, cells expressing high levels of γcR140S exhibited a competitive disadvantage in culture compared to those expressing WT γc, resulting in the enrichment of cells expressing lower levels of γcR140S. These findings extend our understanding of how mutations in the extracellular domain of γc can lead to reduced protein expression and influence the pathophysiology of atypical X-SCID.

While belonging to the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 exhibited unique characteristics that facilitated its widespread transmission and pathogenicity. This study aimed to investigate the molecular characterization and infection kinetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence. We isolated 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants from clinical samples and conducted in vitro studies using Calu-3 cell lines and pseudovirus systems to explore viral entry. Whole-genome sequencing identified mutations linked to increased replication and enhanced immune evasion, particularly through the inhibition of interferon responses. Additionally, persistence studies on common environmental surfaces (copper, aluminum, and plastic) revealed that certain variants, such as G446S, contributed to increased viral stability, suggesting potential for indirect transmission beyond direct person-to-person contact. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of "green" disinfectants, including tea tree oil and quercetin-based compounds, which demonstrated viral load reductions of over 95% within minutes, outperforming conventional alcohol- and UV-based disinfection methods. Notably, two influenza virus isolates belonging to highly divergent subtypes are sanitized as well while showing different persistence surface profiles compared to SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the evolutionary strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 to ensure transmission, its ability to adapt under selective pressure, and the importance of ongoing surveillance of emerging variants. Moreover, the efficacy of environmentally sustainable disinfectants presents a promising strategy for reducing viral transmission in both clinical and community settings.IMPORTANCEIn this study, we evaluated the molecular profile of 11 SARS-CoV-2 variants, focusing on four key virological aspects: viral entry mechanisms, replication dynamics, immune evasion strategies, and surface persistence.

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the severe progression of an infection with Plasmodium falciparum, causing detrimental damage to brain tissue and is the most frequent cause of Plasmodium falciparum mortality. The critical role of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the pathophysiology of CM having been revealed, our investigation focuses on the role of NR2F6, an established immune checkpoint, as a candidate driver of CM pathology. We employed an experimental mouse model of CM based on Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection to compare the relative susceptibility of Nr2f6-knock-out and wild-type C57BL6/N mice. As a remarkable result, Nr2f6 deficiency confers a significant survival benefit. In terms of mechanism, we detected less severe endotheliopathy and, hence, less damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), accompanied by decreased sequestered parasites and less cytotoxic T-lymphocytes within the brain, manifesting in a better disease outcome. We present evidence that NR2F6 deficiency renders mice more resistant to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), confirming a causal and non-redundant role for NR2F6 in the progression of ECM disease. Consequently, pharmacological inhibitors of the NR2F6 pathway could be of use to bolster BBB integrity and protect against CM.">

This study aimed to investigate the association between IL-24 serum levels and the severity of COVID-19 disease. In this prospective bi-center cross-sectional study, we enrolled 41 COVID-19 patients from two hospitals in Germany. Serial blood samples were collected from a subset of patients, resulting in 88 total blood samples. Patients were categorized into critical, severe, moderate, and mild disease groups based on WHO criteria. IL-24 serum levels were measured during the acute or convalescent phase using an ELISA assay. Inflammatory markers, and kidney and liver function parameters were also evaluated. Statistical analysis included non-parametric tests and correlation analysis. Elevated IL-24 serum levels were observed in ambulant patients (mild disease), compared to hospitalized patients (critical, severe, moderate disease, p < 0.05). IL-24 levels were also significantly higher in patients without oxygenation disorder compared to those with oxygenation therapy (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between IL-24 levels and markers of inflammation and liver/kidney function. Elevated IL-24 serum levels were associated with milder COVID-19 courses, suggesting a protective role in modulating immune responses and promoting antiviral apoptosis. Conversely, reduced IL-24 in severe cases may reflect impaired immune regulation, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), marked by persistent symptoms lasting weeks to months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, affects multiple organ systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and renal systems. These prolonged effects stem from chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and direct viral injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)—small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation—play a pivotal role in this process by modulating immune responses, inflammation, and cellular stress. Altered miRNA expression patterns during and after infection contribute to the pathogenesis of Long COVID. While conventional miRNA detection techniques have been valuable, they face limitations in sensitivity, throughput, and detecting RNA modifications. This review highlights Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS) as a promising alternative, offering real-time, long-read, amplification-free RNA sequencing that preserves native modifications. ONS enables direct sequencing of full-length miRNAs and their precursors, providing novel insights into miRNA processing and regulatory roles. Despite current challenges with short-read accuracy, ongoing technical advances are improving ONS performance. Its integration in miRNA profiling holds significant potential for uncovering novel regulatory interactions and advancing clinical biomarker discovery in Long COVID and other conditions.">

        <tr id="Cytokine storm (CS) is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Hypoxic signaling has been proposed to influence proinflammatory pathways and to be involved in the development of CS. Here, for the first time, the role of hypoxia in coronavirus-mediated inflammation has been investigated, using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Analysis of the transcriptome of A549 lung epithelial cells using RNA sequencing revealed 191 mRNAs which were synergistically upregulated and 43 mRNAs which were synergistically downregulated by the combination of human Betacoronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection and hypoxia. Synergistically upregulated mRNAs were strongly associated with inflammatory pathway activation. Analysis of the expression of 105 cytokines and immune-related proteins using antibody arrays identified five proteins (IGFBP-3, VEGF, CCL20, CD30, and myeloperoxidase) which were markedly upregulated in HCoV-OC43 infection in hypoxia compared to HCoV-OC43 infection in normal oxygen conditions. Our findings show that COVID-19 patients with lung hypoxia may face increased risk of inflammatory complications. Two of the proteins we have identified as synergistically upregulated, the cytokines VEGF and CCL20, represent potential future therapeutic targets. These could be targeted directly or, based on the novel findings described here by inhibiting hypoxia signaling pathways, to reduce excessive inflammatory cytokine responses in patients with severe infections.">

        <tr id="Dénes and his co-workers recently published a paper in Nature Neuroscience , documenting that neurological abnormalities in COVID are based on microglial dysfunction in the brain. 1 In case of acute respiratory syndrome of COVID infection, the central nervous system symptomatology signi ﬁ cantly contribute to the severity of this disease. The authors used an autopsy platform allowing morphological and biochemical/molecular biological investigations in postmortem mirror blocks prepared from the brain and peripheral organs of 13 COVID and 23 non- COVID-infected patients. Microglia are resident macrophages of the brain, representing a ﬁ rst defense wall in the case of any type of bacterial or viral infection. 2 They possess G protein-coupled purinergic P2Y12 receptors (Rs) that sense ADP, arising from the enzymatic degradation of ATP that ﬂ ows out from glial/ neuronal cells after damage, caused by infections or metabolic disturbances.

The resulting shortfall in the recognition of ADP interfered with the defensive function of microglial cells.

        <tr id="Monitoring the presence and distribution of distinct immune cell populations is key in deciphering immunopathologic disease mechanisms. Considering the crucial role of myeloid cells in provoking hyperinflammatory responses associated with coronavirus disease 2019, a camelid-derived single-domain antibody specifically recognizing human signal-regulatory protein-α (SIRPα) as a biomarker for myeloid cells has been generated and radiolabeled with 64Cu, that is, [64Cu]copper-SIRPα-nanobody ([64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb), for in vivo PET imaging. In this study, this PET tracer was used and validated to monitor the temporal dynamics of inflammatory processes during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nonhuman primates. For further validation, the signal of [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb was compared with the signal of TSPO-targeting [18F]fluorine-N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ([18F]F-DPA714). Methods: Six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently monitored for 7 wk. We performed a baseline [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT before infection, followed by repetitive PET/CT on days 3, 10, 24, and 52 after infection covering the head, thorax, and abdominal region. Of the 6 macaques, 3 underwent additional TSPO-targeting [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT investigations at baseline and at days 2, 9, 23, and 51 after infection. Tracheal and nasal swabs were taken to monitor the course of infection, and changes in blood count and inflammatory mediators in the periphery blood were monitored. Results: Detection of subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA from tracheal and nasal swab samples confirmed viral infection of all animals. CT scans identified initial pulmonary lesions 2 days after infection. [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb PET/CT revealed increased tracer uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes of all animals, but not in the lung lesions, 3 days after infection. [18F]F-DPA714 PET/CT showed increased uptake in both anatomically affected and unaffected lung tissues. The increased [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake in the spleen and bone marrow of all animals was more pronounced 3 and 7 wk after infection. We detected individual differences in [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb uptake within the bone marrow and spleen, whereas [18F]F-DPA714 exhibited rather homogeneous uptake patterns. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [64Cu]Cu-SIRPα-Nb is a versatile tool for quantitative monitoring of whole-body distribution, temporal distribution, and accumulation dynamics of myeloid cell subpopulations even in moderately inflamed tissues and affected lymphatic organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Bacterial pneumonia poses a substantial global health burden, yet the immunological mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis and resolution are incompletely understood.


METHODS
We generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood immune cells from 100 individuals: 39 with severe bacterial pneumonia, 31 with mild disease, and 30 healthy controls. Integrating scRNA-seq with clinical and molecular data revealed profound remodeling of the peripheral immune landscape across disease severities.


MAIN RESULTS
Severe pneumonia was characterized by lymphopenia and monocytosis, accompanied by distinct shifts in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subset composition. Classical monocytes emerged as central orchestrators of the cytokine storm observed in severe cases, displaying elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., S100A8/9/12) and enhanced TLR4-MYD88 signaling. Exhaustion of innate-like CD8+ T cells, marked by upregulation of canonical inhibitory receptors, was a hallmark of severe disease. In contrast, mild pneumonia exhibited robust CD8+ T effector and helper memory cell activation, along with effective humoral immunity, evidenced by plasma cell expansion and coordinated Tfh-B cell interactions. B cells in mild cases showed enhanced antigen recognition, BCR signaling, and co-stimulatory gene expression, whereas those in severe cases displayed signs of dysfunction. Myeloid cell alterations in severe pneumonia included increased monocytic MDSCs and non-classical monocytes, contributing to immunosuppression and complement overactivation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This high-resolution atlas of peripheral immune responses in bacterial pneumonia identifies key cellular and molecular drivers of disease severity, providing potential therapeutic targets for immunomodulation and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="Preventing T cell migration to the central nervous system (CNS) has remarkable therapeutic effects in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) but is poorly effective against the progressive form (PMS). Disability progression in PMS likely results from an interplay between smoldering local inflammation and neurodegeneration. The mechanisms sustaining the chronicity of PMS are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the potential role of tissue-resident memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Trm cells) in sustaining chronic CNS autoimmunity. We showed that CD4+ Trm cells were present in the CNS of mice with chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and in brain tissues from persons with PMS. Using flow cytometry and immunohistofluorescence analysis, we revealed the presence of bona fide CD4+ Trm cells expressing characteristic Trm cell surface markers, including CD69, CXCR6, P2RX7, and CD49a, in the CNS of mice with EAE and in the brains of persons with PMS. These T cells also expressed the transcription factor Hobit in mice with chronic EAE. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis uncovered the transcriptional heterogeneity and inflammatory potential of CD4+ Trm cells, and, accordingly, these cells localized within CNS inflammatory lesions of mice with EAE and persons with PMS. Last, either genetic or pharmacological depletion of CD4+ Trm cells combined with antibody-mediated depletion of the recirculating CD4+ T cell compartment alleviated neurological signs during the chronic phase of EAE. Our results indicate that CD4+ Trm cells contribute to maintain a chronic inflammatory state in the CNS and suggest that therapeutic strategies for PMS should consider targeting the CNS-resident T cell compartment.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections globally, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. While recent advances in prophylaxis, such as long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization, offer promise for prevention, therapeutic options for active infection remain limited. Severe RSV disease is often driven not solely by viral replication but by dysregulated host immune responses, including excessive cytokine production, T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) cell polarization, and impaired interferon signaling. RSV has evolved sophisticated immune evasion strategies, such as inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) via nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2), and interference with pattern recognition receptor signaling, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. These mechanisms result in attenuated innate immune responses and defective adaptive immunity, contributing to viral persistence, immunopathology, and recurrent infections. Moreover, age-dependent vulnerabilities, such as immune immaturity in infants and immunosenescence in older adults, exacerbate disease severity. Excessive immune activation leads to bronchiolitis, airway remodeling, and long-term sequelae including wheezing and asthma. Emerging immunomodulatory therapies aim to restore immune balance, targeting cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, or inflammasome activity. Host-directed therapies and direct-acting antivirals are also under investigation. A better understanding of RSV–host immune interactions is critical for optimizing therapeutic strategies and designing effective vaccines. This review synthesizes current knowledge on RSV immunopathogenesis and highlights immunomodulation as a promising frontier for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="COVID affects around 400 million individuals today with a strong economic impact on the global economy. The list of long COVID symptoms is extremely broad because it is derived from neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, and renal dysfunctions and damages. We review here these pathophysiological manifestations and the predictors of this multi-organ pathology like the persistence of the virus, altered endothelial function, unrepaired tissue damage, immune dysregulation, and gut dysbiosis. We also discuss the similarities between long COVID and vaccine side effects together with possible common immuno-inflammatory pathways. Since the spike protein is present in SARS-CoV-2 (and its variants) but also produced by the COVID vaccines, its toxicity may also apply to all mRNA or adenoviral DNA vaccines as they are based on the production of a very similar spike protein to the virus. After COVID infection or vaccination, the spike protein can last for months in the body and may interact with ACE2 receptors and mannan-binding lectin (MBL)/mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP-2), which are present almost everywhere in the organism. As a result, the spike protein may be able to trigger inflammation in a lot of organs and systems similar to COVID infection. We suggest that three immuno-inflammatory pathways are particularly key and responsible for long COVID and COVID vaccine side effects, as it has been shown for COVID, which may explain in large part their strong similarities: the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), the kininogen–kinin–kallikrein system (KKS), and the lectin complement pathway. We propose that therapeutic studies should focus on these pathways to propose better cures for both long COVID as well as for COVID vaccine side effects.">

It is further developed immuno-lung organoids comprising hPSC-derived alveolar and airway organoids co-cultured with macrophages to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of macrophage-mediated lung damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="Bacterial meningitis is a severe central nervous system infection with incompletely understood pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in blood-brain barrier disruption induced by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). In vitro studies revealed that ExPEC infection upregulated TLR4 expression in human brain microvascular endothelial cells and induced pyroptosis and tight junction protein degradation. TLR4 inhibition by TAK-242 significantly reduced pyroptosis and inflammatory responses but exacerbated tight junction disruption and bacterial invasion. In macrophages, TLR4 inhibition similarly attenuated pyroptosis and inflammatory responses. Interestingly, despite enhanced blood-brain barrier disruption and increased bacterial burden, TLR4-deficient mice showed significantly improved survival. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TLR4 deficiency triggered comprehensive reprogramming of host responses, characterized by both suppressed inflammatory damage and enhanced tissue homeostatic processes. This study demonstrates for the first time that endothelial pyroptosis is a novel mechanism for ExPEC-induced blood-brain barrier disruption and reveals the crucial role of TLR4 in balancing protective and destructive host responses, providing new insights for therapeutic strategies against bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is a growing public health challenge. Neuroinflammation has been proposed as a prominent pathological feature of AD and has traditionally been attributed to the innate immune system. However, emerging evidence highlights the involvement of adaptive immunity, particularly T and B lymphocytes, in the neuroinflammatory processes of AD. It remains unclear how adaptive immune responses, originally intended to protect the body, contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in AD. Here, we review the roles of adaptive immunity, cellular composition, and niches and their contribution to AD development and progression. Notably, we synthesize the crosstalk between adaptive immunity and the innate immune system of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mainly mediated by glial cells and myeloid cells, and their interrelationships with amyloid-β (Aβ)/Tau pathology. We hypothesized that the alterations observed in innate immunity in AD mirror age-related immune alterations, whereas the dysregulation of adaptive immunity contributes more accurately to disease-specific immune responses. Targeting adaptive immunity in the context of neuroinflammation may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies designed to modulate immune responses, thereby facilitating the diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of AD.">

        <tr id="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. Although it is traditionally viewed as a neuron-centric disease, neurodegeneration is increasingly linked to immunosenescence and age-related immune dysfunction, but the mechanisms connecting immune ageing to neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. In this review, we explore how metabolic reprogramming, especially the loss of metabolic plasticity in senescent immune cells, drives neuroinflammation in ALS. Senescent immune cells, including microglia and T cells, exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, redox imbalance, impaired autophagy, and altered nutrient-sensing pathways that impair their homeostatic and reparative capacities. These cells adopt a metabolically demanding pro-inflammatory phenotype, sustaining an inflammatory secretome while promoting glial activation and neuronal damage. Finally, we discuss how targeting immunometabolic pathways may offer new therapeutic opportunities to restore immune balance, mitigate neuroinflammation, and potentially slow ALS progression. Understanding the metabolic basis of immune ageing is essential for developing effective, age-tailored interventions for ALS.">

Several cellular modifications in aged cells may lead to systemic inflammation and fibrotic responses. Age or exogenous insults induce cellular senescence, further increasing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to the condition known as inflammaging, that can contribute to disease severity. Older individuals presented signs of systemic hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19, but few studies analyzed the influence of age on lung tissue responses in cases of severe COVID-19. We hypothesized that age related alterations regarding innate/acquired immunity and cellular senescence in lung tissue of individuals without lung diseases could predispose to viral infection. We also aimed to identify how the aged lung responded to severe COVID-19 infection. We studied lung tissues from 19 individuals that died from non-pulmonary causes and 28 adult individuals who died from COVID-19 between March and May of 2020, divided according to their age (> or < 60 years). Tissue sections were stained, via immunohistochemistry, and 19 markers among immune cells, COVID-19 receptors, cytokines and senescence were analyzed in the lung parenchyma of both groups. In the COVID-19 group, the Luminex multiplex assay technique was used to detect a panel of 25 cytokines/chemokines. In control lungs, aged individuals had a lower TLR7 expression, without differences in other markers. Older patients had a shorter time between onset of symptoms and death, with a significant negative correlation with age. Unlike the adult younger group, older COVID − 19 patients presented significant differences in relation to their age matched controls in the expression of CD8 + T cells, IFN-α2, TLR7, pSTAT-3, p21 and p53. They also presented higher protein expression that IFN-α2 and TGF-beta than the adult COVID-19 group, with a trend to decreased CD20 + cell density in the lungs. Taken together, our data show age adversely affects the lung expression of key proteins related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, by perpetuating inflammation and increasing pro-fibrotic responses.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Tens of thousands of severe COVID-19 cases are hospitalized weekly in the U.S., often driven by an imbalance between antiviral responses and inflammatory signaling, leading to uncontrolled cytokine secretion. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein is a known immune antagonist, but its role in macrophage-driven cytokine storms is unclear. We demonstrate that N functions in a pathway-specific manner, specifically amplifying nuclear factor κB-related transcripts upon Toll-like receptor 7/8 stimulation. Moreover, we show that this is a conserved feature of pathogenic coronaviruses, with the delta variant N being the most pro-inflammatory. Our interaction networks suggest the delta variant N drives inflammation through interactions with several stress granule-related proteins. Profiling of secreted cytokines revealed that supernatants from the delta variant N-expressing macrophages disrupt brain and heart endothelial barriers, implicating N in COVID-19-associated cognitive and cardiac complications. Our findings highlight N-mediated immune imbalance as a driver of severe COVID-19 and identify N as a promising therapeutic target to mitigate hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Persistent symptoms and complications reported by many patients for more than four weeks after contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are referred to as post-COVID-19 syndrome. These persistent symptoms can occur in individuals with both mild and severe COVID-19, though the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to explore post-COVID-19 syndrome from a biological perspective, focusing on genomic instability. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the comet assay method was employed in March 2024 to evaluate the level of DNA damage in 29 patients to examine the post-COVID-19 syndrome state at Kausar Semnan Hospital in Iran. Levels of DNA damage were assessed using the alkaline comet assay in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four weeks after a positive RT-PCR test. Patients were categorized based on pneumonia severity: mild (11 patients in non-ICU), moderate (10 patients in ICU and non-intubated), and severe/critical (8 patients in ICU and intubated). Ten healthy individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 were considered as a control group. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tests at a significance level of p < 0.01 in GraphPad Prism 9 software. Results Post-COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of DNA damage compared to healthy controls. The highest DNA damage was observed in intubated-ICU patients (mean DNA damage: 29.5%), followed by non-intubated-ICU patients (mean: 24.3%), non-ICU patients (mean: 19.1%), and healthy controls (mean: 9.4%). These findings suggest a clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and increased genomic instability. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the prevalence of DNA damage in post-COVID-19 patients, which may explain long-term genomic instability and associated health complications. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-COVID-19 syndrome, particularly its impact on genomic stability. This study contributes to the growing evidence that post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition with virus-specific abnormalities affecting multiple biological pathways. Future studies should focus on understanding these mechanisms to develop targeted interventions for long-term COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has triggered a global health crisis, with over 700 million confirmed cases and at least 7 million deaths reported by early 2024. Children are less vulnerable to severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection than adults and typically experience milder respiratory symptoms. However, a rare but significant complication, known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS‐C), can develop weeks after infection, characterized by a spectrum of inflammatory symptoms. This study employed whole‐exome sequencing and over‐representation analysis to identify genetic variants of potential clinical significance related to MIS‐C or severe COVID‐19 in a group of children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), all of whom were unvaccinated for COVID‐19. We observed the enrichment of potentially pathogenic genetic variants in genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, particularly glycogen breakdown, in severe COVID‐19 pediatric patients, and in genes related to cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in MIS‐C patients. These findings offer insights into the genetic underpinnings of MIS‐C and severe COVID‐19, suggesting potential genes and biological pathways for further research.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

        <tr id="Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease and the quality of life of patients co-infected with COVID-19 and TB is significantly impacted due to the nature of these diseases. It is still unknown how our immune system will respond to both these pathogens in sequel. As it has been discovered that Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) result in caseating granulomas in TB and pathology in COVID-19, we conducted this work to determine the amounts of NET molecules in the bloodstream and to comprehend their function during TB and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We recruited 43 healthy volunteers, 40 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and 18 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Results Although Citrullinated Histone H3 and myeloperoxidase, did not show any difference in their levels, the NET marker elastase had significantly reduced circulatory levels in the tuberculosis group with SARS-CoV IgG positivity compared to tuberculosis group without SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity. Discussion The substantial decrease in elastase levels observed in the diabetic cohort of TB patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity is intriguing and needs large cohort studies in the future to understand the influence of diabetes in TB patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="High-altitude cognitive impairment (HACI) results from acute or chronic exposure to hypoxic conditions. Brain lipid homeostasis is crucial for cognitive function, and lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in glia cells is linked to cognitive decline in aging and stroke. However, whether high-altitude exposure affects brain lipid homeostasis is unclear. Microglia, key regulators of brain homeostasis and inflammation, play a significant role in pathological cognitive impairment and are implicated in LD formation. This study investigates whether lipid dysregulation contributes to HACI and explores microglia-driven mechanisms and potential interventions. Mice were exposed to a simulated 7000 m altitude for 48 h, followed by a week of recovery. Cognitive function and LD accumulation in brain cells were assessed. Microglia were depleted using PLX5622, and mice were exposed to hypoxia or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to validate microglia’s role in driving astrocytic LD accumulation and cognitive decline. Minocycline was used to inhibit inflammation. In vitro, co-culture systems of microglia and astrocytes were employed to confirm microglia-derived pro-inflammatory factors’ role in astrocytic LD accumulation. Hypobaric hypoxia exposure induced persistent cognitive impairment and LD accumulation in hippocampal astrocytes and microglia. Microglia depletion alleviated cognitive deficits and reduced astrocytic LD accumulation. Hypoxia or LPS did not directly cause LD accumulation in astrocytes but activated microglia to release IL-1β, inducing astrocytic LD accumulation. Microglia depletion also mitigated LPS-induced cognitive impairment and astrocytic LD accumulation. Minocycline reduced hypoxia-induced LD accumulation in co-cultured astrocytes and improved cognitive function. Hypoxia triggers pro-inflammatory microglial activation, leading to LD accumulation and the release of IL-1β, which drives astrocytic LD accumulation and neuroinflammation, exacerbating HACI. Minocycline effectively restores brain lipid homeostasis and mitigates cognitive impairment. This study provides novel insights into HACI mechanisms and suggests potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Pulmonary infections, ranging from mild respiratory issues to severe multiorgan failure, pose a major global health threat. The immune response in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and COVID-19 influences disease severity and outcomes, but molecular pathogenesis differs across pathogens. Comparisons of plasma cytokine profiles between CAP and COVID-19 are limited. Analyzing these profiles with machine learning and bioinformatics could reveal subtle patterns and improve our understanding of immune responses in both conditions. Methods We conducted a novel case–control study to profile cytokine levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19. Age- and sex-matched cohorts included 39 patients with CAP, 39 with COVID-19, and 20 healthy controls. We measured 384 plasma cytokine levels using proximity extension assays and analyzed differences between cohorts with conventional statistical methods, bioinformatics and machine learning. Results Median ages of the cohorts were comparable (P = 0.797). COVID-19 patients exhibited a higher prevalence of hematologic disease (P = 0.047), increased corticosteroid use (P = 0.040), and reduced antibiotic use (P = 0.012). Clinical outcomes, including mortality, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury, were similar between groups. Both cohorts showed comparable absolute circulating cytokine profiles but distinct profiles relative to healthy controls. Machine learning identified a model of twelve cytokines that distinguished CAP from COVID-19 with a classification accuracy of 0.71 (SD 0.20). Gene ontology and enrichment analysis revealed differences in cytosolic and nuclear functions, intracellular signaling, stress responses, and cell cycle processes between patient cohorts and healthy controls. Enriched GO pathways showed that CAP pathways were positively associated with leukocyte counts and ARDS development, while COVID-19 pathways were negatively associated with ARDS and positively with platelet counts. Conclusions This case–control study provides insights into cytokine profiles related to CAP and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Although absolute circulating cytokine levels showed no significant differences between the groups, machine learning identified a model of twelve proteins that effectively distinguished the cohorts. Gene ontology and enrichment analyses also revealed distinct dysregulated pathways with differing associations with clinical variables in each cohort. These findings underscore the complexity and variability of cytokine responses in pulmonary infections.

        <tr id="Background Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common acute condition in neurosurgery, with microglial function playing a crucial role in determining patient outcomes. However, the involved mechanisms are complex and demand thorough investigation. In our study, we combined transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches to identify key regulators of microglial function, offering novel insights for potential therapeutic strategies in SAH treatment. Methods The neurological function of SAH mice was evaluated using the open field test, rotarod test, and nissl staining. In an in vitro SAH model, key pathways and genes that regulate microglial function were identified through the integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Immunofluorescence, Western blot, Real-Time PCR, pHrodo, and Lyso-Tracker were employed to assess lysosomal and microglial function. Results In SAH mice, both neurological and microglial functions were significantly impaired on the first day but showed recovery over time. The combined results from transcriptomics and metabolomics identified 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) as a key target in regulating microglial function post-SAH. Administering resolvin D1 (RvD1) exogenously to inhibit 5-LOX nuclear translocation or directly supplementing lipoxin A4 (LXA4) to adjust the leukotriene B4 (LTB4)/LXA4 ratio, can improve lysosomal acidification, mitigate impaired lysosomal function, and enhance phagocytosis while reducing the inflammatory response. Protecting microglial function can also be achieved through JNJ or P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) siRNA, which inhibit calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation, prevent 5-LOX nuclear translocation, and improve lysosomal function. Furthermore, P2X7 siRNA also improved neurological function, lysosomal function and microglial function in SAH mice. Conclusion Activation of P2X7-CaMKII after SAH promotes 5-LOX nuclear translocation, increases the LTB4/LXA4 ratio, elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and impairs lysosomal and microglial function.

With recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, a growing body of research has revealed that this communication is highly dynamic, shifting across states of health, aging, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. In this review, we synthesize the current findings on intercellular communication networks involving neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and other glial populations in the CNS across four major states: healthy homeostasis, aging, demyelinating diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We focus on how changes in intercellular communication contribute to the maintenance or disruption of CNS integrity and function. Mechanistic insights into these signaling networks have revealed new molecular targets and pathways that may be exploited for therapeutic intervention. By comparing the intercellular signaling mechanisms across different disease contexts, we underscore the importance of CNS crosstalk not only as a hallmark of disease progression, but also as a potential gateway for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background In cardiac arrest (CA) patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), neuroinflammation following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) contributes to brain ischemia/reperfusion injury and neurological dysfunction. Recent evidence suggested that neuraminidase could exacerbate inflammatory responses by disrupting CD24‐Siglec‐G/10 immune checkpoint axis. As a neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir phosphate (OP) holds potential for immunomodulation beyond its antiviral use. We aimed to investigate the impact and mechanism of OP on neuroinflammation regulation after ROSC. Methods Male pigs were randomized into the sham control group, CPR, and CPR + OP group. CA was induced in pigs through 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation. Brains were harvested for assessing serum inflammatory markers and neuronal damage at 24 h after ROSC. BV2 microglial underwent oxygen–glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Effects of OP on inflammatory responses, NF‐κB activation, cell viability, and the CD24‐Siglec‐G/10 interaction were evaluated using immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, molecular, and biochemical assays. Results In vivo, OP attenuated pig cerebral microglial activation and neuronal integrity with attenuated neuroinflammation, alongside time‐dependent neuraminidase activity increases. In vitro, OP suppressed OGD/R‐induced microglial NF‐κB activation, reduced pro‐inflammatory cytokine levels, and preserved CD24‐Siglec‐G interaction, correlating with diminished neuraminidase release. Conclusions OP as a repurposed immunomodulator that suppresses microglial‐driven neuroinflammation after CA by preserving sialylation‐dependent CD24‐Siglec‐G/10 interaction.">

In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections.">

        <tr id="Heat shock proteins (HSPs), particularly those in the HSP70 family, play essential roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and orchestrating stress responses, including those triggered by viral infections. Based on data mining of published datasets and experimental characterization, this study identified HSPA9 phosphorylation at serine 627 (S627) as a potential regulatory site associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings demonstrate that phospho-S627 HSPA9 enhances mitochondrial function and mass, potentially meeting the elevated energy demands of viral replication. Concurrently, phosphorylation at S627 suppresses host cell proliferation, potentially delaying immune activation and facilitating viral spread. Moreover, phosphorylation at both the S627 and S378 sites markedly reduces the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, which may further weaken the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may exploit HSPA9 phosphorylation to bolster its replication and evade host defenses. Notably, MAPKAPK2 has emerged as a latent kinase that regulates this phosphorylation, making it a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of these conditions. Overall, our results shed light on a novel mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, suggesting that HSPA9 phosphorylation may be a potential therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Influenza causes 3–5 million severe cases globally each year, with severe viral pneumonia often requiring hospitalization for over four weeks. While the inflammatory response to influenza infection helps control viral replication, excessive inflammation is a key driver of disease severity and mortality. Excessive pulmonary lymphocytes, particularly IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes, contribute significantly to pulmonary inflammation at the late-stage of H1N1 viral infection. Cyclosporin A, a potent T-cell inhibitor, mitigates influenza A virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. However, the therapeutic role of lymphocyte suppression in cyclosporin A-mediated attenuation of H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the viral titer was 0 in all the homogenized lung tissues of mice on Day-21 post a sublethal H1N1 viral infection. H1N1 viral infection caused worsened general condition and pulmonary inflammation with the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils on Day-21 post-infection. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of H1N1 virus-infected mice showed a 16-fold higher lymphocyte count compared to neutrophils. H1N1 viral infection significantly elevated both IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations and IFN-γ levels in mouse lungs. H1N1 viral infection additionally expanded IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations in both spleen and peripheral blood. Cyclosporin A treatment significantly mitigated H1N1 viral infection-induced worsened general condition, pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation, increases of pulmonary IFN-γ concentrations and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes in the lung, spleen and blood of mice on Day-21 post-infection. Together, lymphocytes may contribute significantly to H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation. Cyclosporin A may alleviate H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation through decreasing IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes.

        <tr id="Goal The present study intended to evaluate whether the profile of soluble immune mediators observed in cord blood samples resembles the pattern identified for mother serum samples. Methods For this purpose, parallel analysis of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors was carried out in mother–newborn paired samples from acute and convalescent COVID-19 subgroups (Early, Intermediate, and Late) as well as healthy controls (HC). Results Data demonstrated that increased levels of CCL11, IFN-γ, IL1-Ra, and G-CSF were observed in cord blood samples from most COVID-19 subgroups, with fold change magnitude from 1.6× to 8.2× as compared with HC. Comparative analysis of mother–newborn pairs demonstrated that several immune mediators (CCL11, CCL4, IFN-γ, PDFG, and G-CSF) exhibited high increment magnitude in cord blood as compared with mother serum, reaching values up to 15.7×, mainly at convalescent COVID-19 infection. The signatures of soluble immune mediators revealed distinct waveforms for cord blood and mother serum, with a waning of immune mediators in the latter, contrasting with the increasing set of molecules in the former from acute toward convalescent COVID-19. Integrative network analysis of immune mediators in mother–newborn pairs showed an increase of neighborhood connectivity both in microenvironments and in their interplay from acute toward late convalescent COVID-19. Our results support the hypothesis of the interplay between mother serum and cord blood microenvironment that may impact the fetus development. Conclusion Together, this evidence regarding the maternal–fetal crosstalk can ultimately subsidize the improvement of clinical practice and public health policies for management of prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Sepsis, a condition characterized by immune dysregulation, is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality and requires rapid treatment. Assessing immune dysregulation has been challenging. The IntelliSep Index (ISI), a novel biomarker which leverages microfluidic deformability cytometry to assess immune activation, has been evaluated as a test for Emergency Department use but it is unclear how the signal evolves as patient condition evolves. In a 47-patient cohort with hospital stays ≤ 14 days, ISI provided a good indicator of disease progression by blinded physician review. ISI trends correlated with clinical improvement over time. During the first 12 h following presentation, ISI was unaffected by antibiotic treatment initiated in the emergency department (ED). After this period however, ISI values declined, reflecting the patient’s response to treatment, with Band 3 patients showing a 20% decline within the first two days of admission. ISI trends preceded Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score changes by two days. ISI also provided more stable and timely disease state assessments compared to traditional biomarkers (PCT, CRP, IL-6, and neutrophil elastase). Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and assess ISI’s clinical utility as a prognosticator of sepsis progression and treatment response.

        <tr id="Pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a self-limiting disease. Its progression and prognosis are highly heterogeneous among people of different ages, genders, and living with different life styles. Such heterogeneity also exists in treatment outcomes of different patients. Various physiological and pathological factors, such as renewal of pulmonary cell, number of entry receptor and viral replication, have been identified linking to the development of the disease. However, it is still unclear how these factors collectively establish a causal relationship in the course of disease progression. In this study, we built a mechanistic model to explain the dynamics of infection and progression of COVID-19. We modeled how the interaction of pulmonary cells determine the dynamics of disease progression by characterizing the temporal dynamics of viral load, infected and health alveolar cells, and dysfunctional alveolar cells. The viral and cellular dynamics captured different stages of clinical manifestations in individual patient during disease progression: the incubation period, mild symptom period, and severe period. We further simulated clinical interference at different stages of disease progression. The results showed that some medical interventions show no improvement either in reducing the recovery rate or shortening the recovery time. Our theoretical framework may provide a mechanistic explanation at the systems level for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 as well as other similar respiratory tract diseases.">

        <tr id="mRNA-LNP-based COVID-19 vaccines, namely Pfizer-BioNTech’s Comirnaty and Moderna’s Spikevax, were successfully deployed to help control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and their updated formulations continue to be recommended, albeit only for high-risk populations. One widely discussed aspect of these vaccines is their uniquely broad spectrum and increased incidence of adverse events (AEs), collectively referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). Although the reported PVS rate is low, the high number of administered doses among healthy individuals has resulted in a substantial number of reported vaccine-related injuries. A prominent manifestation of PVS is multisystem inflammation, hypothesized to result from the systemic transfection of organ cells with genetic instructions for a toxin, the spike protein, delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). In this narrative review, we focus on endothelial cells in the microcirculatory networks of various organs as primary sites of transfection with mRNA-LNP and consequent PVS. We outline the anatomical variations in the microcirculation contributing to the individual variability of symptoms and examine the molecular and cellular responses to vaccine nanoparticle exposure at the endothelial cell level with a focus on the pathways of a sustained cascade of toxic and autoimmune processes. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying mRNA-LNP-induced AEs and PVS at the organ and cellular levels is critical for improving the safety of future vaccines and other therapeutic applications of this groundbreaking technology.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes cardiovascular complications, which contributes to the high mortality rate of the disease. Emerging evidence indicates that aberrant vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) function is a key driver of vascular disease in COVID-19. While antivirals alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19, it is not known whether these drugs directly affect SMCs. Accordingly, the present study investigated the ability of three approved COVID-19 antiviral drugs to influence SMC function. Treatment of SMCs with remdesivir (RDV), but not molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir, inhibited cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and migration without affecting cell viability. RDV also stimulated an increase in heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression that was not observed with molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir. The induction of HO-1 by RDV was abolished by mutating the antioxidant responsive element of the promoter, overexpressing dominant-negative NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), or treating cells with an antioxidant. Finally, silencing HO-1 partly rescued the proliferative and migratory response of RDV-treated SMCs, and this was reversed by carbon monoxide and bilirubin. In conclusion, the induction of HO-1 via the oxidant-sensitive Nrf2 signaling pathway contributes to the antiproliferative and antimigratory actions of RDV by generating carbon monoxide and bilirubin. These pleiotropic actions of RDV may prevent occlusive vascular disease in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Unfortunately, survivors of traumatic stress exposure (TSE) frequently develop adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) such as chronic pain and stress/depressive symptoms. Increasing evidence indicates that there is a ‘window of opportunity’ following TSE in which therapeutic interventions are most effective against APNS, yet mechanisms accounting for this observation are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to better understand such mechanisms by generating snapshots of the transcriptional landscape in the early aftermath of TSE across tissues and time. Adult rats were exposed to a TSE model, single prolonged stress (SPS). Then, eight tissues (hypothalamus, left and right hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, heart, and muscle) were isolated from these animals at 2, 24, and 72 h after SPS and in unexposed controls (n = 6 per group). mRNA expression from deep sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological pathways enriched over time, and predicted upstream regulators. In all tissues except the amygdala, the highest number of DEGs was observed 2-h post-SPS, but DEGs were detected at all timepoints and in all tissues. Some transcripts were differentially expressed in a consistent manner across multiple tissues at a time point (e.g. Fkbp5, 2 h post-SPS), while others had tissue- or region-specific expression patterns. Stress system pathways were most represented at 2 h post-SPS, then stress/circadian/inflammatory pathways at 24 h, and inflammatory pathways at 72 h. Together these findings provide insights into post-TSE transcriptional landscape dynamics and suggest specific intervention windows of opportunity. Future validation is needed across sex, age, stressor, and cell type.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and function in the central nervous system, including their involvement in reparative processes. Here, we examined how a common mutation in the homeostatic iron regulatory gene, H67D HFE, impacts the antioxidant mechanism of astrocytes and migration under normal and reparative conditions. Previous data from our group suggested that this mutation may modify disease progression through an antioxidant mechanism involving nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferritin. In this study, we used primary murine astrocytes with either the H67D or wild‐type HFE genotype to determine whether astrocytes contribute to the antioxidant protective mechanism previously observed. We analyzed their antioxidant profile and migration both at baseline and after a scratch wound injury. We found that H67D HFE astrocytes expressed the HFE protein and exhibited an enhanced antioxidant profile, marked by increased glutathione and GPX4 at baseline, and a reduced migration length into three‐dimensional granular hydrogel scaffolds. However, following scratch wound injury, these astrocytes exhibited a shift in migratory behavior, leading to faster wound infiltration. Moreover, their antioxidant response became even more pronounced after injury, with increased expression of Nrf2, GPX4, and H‐ferritin (FTH1). These results suggest that the mechanism underlying HFE mutation neuroprotection in disease processes involves an antioxidant profile in astrocytes, which is increased upon insult to activate the astrocytic reparative mechanism.">

        <tr id="Current pharmacological treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) predominantly employs dopaminergic agents aimed at enhancing cerebral dopamine levels. While these therapeutic strategies provide symptomatic relief, their palliative nature is frequently associated with dose-dependent complications, including gastrointestinal disturbances, emetic symptoms, and motor complications such as dyskinesia. Moreover, the honeymoon period of drugs has greatly limited their clinical application. The multifactorial etiology of PD continues to challenge researchers, yet substantial evidence implicates α-synuclein as a critical pathogenic mediator. Emerging findings suggest that dysregulated neuroimmune interactions constitute a fundamental mechanism in PD progression, where chronic immune activation appears particularly detrimental to neuronal survival. Notably, neuroinflammatory cascades coupled with compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity create a self-perpetuating cycle of neural degeneration, wherein α-synuclein-specific T cells exacerbate disease pathology while regulatory T cell populations demonstrate potential immunomodulatory capacities. This review systematically examines the mechanistic interplay involving neuroinflammatory cascades, BBB compromise, central nervous system (CNS) immunoregulation, and T lymphocyte subpopulations (including regulatory T cells) in the pathogenesis of PD. By synthesizing current evidence, we aim to establish a conceptual framework supporting the investigation of cellular immunity-based therapies for PD.">

        <tr id="The human immune system undergoes continuous remodeling from infancy through old age, yet the timing and trajectory of these changes across the lifespan remain poorly defined. To address this, we profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 95 healthy individuals (ages 2 months to 88 years), including infants (n=27), children (n=23), adults (n=18), and older adults (n=27) using scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq. MAIT and γδ T cells showed a “Rise and fall” pattern, which rise in childhood, peak in young adulthood, and decline with age. CD8+ T cells were the most affected by aging with decreasing naïve T cells and increasing GzK+ CD8+ T cells and TEMRA cells. Infants had lower myeloid/lymphoid ratio, with a distinct composition marked by increased frequencies of CD16+ monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells and reduced frequencies of CD14+ monocytes and conventional DCs. Their adaptive immune compartment also displayed unique features, including constitutive interferon-stimulated gene expression in T and B cells, and an expanded SOX4+ populations in naïve CD4+, naïve CD8+ and γδ T cells, comprising ~30% of the naïve T cell pool. SOX4+ naïve CD4+ T cells displayed a Th2 epigenetic signature.

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life-threatening syndrome involving dysfunction of multiple immune cell types.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to comprehensively depict the dynamic trajectory of immune responses throughout the disease course of HBV-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF).


DESIGN
Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell proteomics were performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 45 samples from 17 patients who were hospitalised (progressive/stable/recovering course of HBV-ACLF, 6/5/6) and 15 control subjects (liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B and healthy controls, 5/5/5). Functional and mechanistic experiments were validated in vivo and in vitro.


RESULTS
Single-cell multiomics analysis revealed specific changes in the peripheral immune response in ACLF. VCAN+CD14+-monocytes with activated interferon-stimulated genes and enhanced inflammatory functions, stimulated by HBV relapse and expanded in ACLF-1, fuelling early inflammatory storm. The subsequent apoptotic hepatocytes predominantly induce hyperinflammatory C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)+-neutrophils and CD163+-monocytes, enriching in patients with progressive ACLF and serving as significant markers of disease deterioration. Cytotoxic T-cells were functionally impaired and significantly decreased in progressive patients. CXCR2+-neutrophils exhibited immunosuppressive activity and induced the exhaustion of cytotoxic T-cells. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 significantly reduced neutrophils infiltration, restored cytotoxic T-cells and showed therapeutic effect in ACLF mice. Six immune cellular modules (CMs) were identified for patient stratification, with CM2 and CM6 showing strong predictive value for disease outcomes, and CM3 indicating a potential early therapeutic window.


CONCLUSION
Our longitudinal multiomics study revealed the dynamic evolution of the immune response in HBV-ACLF and characterised diverse immune patterns for the future precise management and therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="The three pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis (MS) are inflammation, demyelination, and progressive neurodegeneration. None of the approved disease-modifying therapies for MS counters all three pathologies, and, more specifically, none is approved for neuroprotection. Axonal loss is the most significant contributor to chronic and irreversible disability in MS. A tantalizing molecular target has emerged to uniquely counter all three MS pathologies: tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2). Agonism or activation of TNFR2 has been shown in MS models to induce immunosuppression, oligodendrocyte precursor differentiation, and neuroprotection. Further, in basic science studies stemming from the past 15 years, TNFR2 agonism is known to be a strong inducer of T-regulatory cells (Tregs). Treg cells, and especially those expressing TNFR2, are known to confer the strongest suppression per cell type. TNFR2 is even more attractive as a therapeutic target because of its restricted expression by only a handful of CNS and immune cell subsets, thereby minimizing the likelihood of systemic and other adverse effects. Recent antibody design work suggests many of the hurdles of Treg agonism may have been overcome. This review covers the current treatment landscape for MS, the basic science of TNFR2, the rationale for and evidence behind TNFR2 agonism to treat multiple sclerosis, the design of potent TNFR2 agonist antibodies, and the treatment applications for other neurological, autoimmune, or inflammatory diseases.">

Beyond respiratory complications, the disease involves systemic manifestations driven by immune dysregulation, inflammation, and coagulopathy. Among the many mechanisms implicated in severe disease, a growing body of evidence suggests a central role for the imbalance between proteases and antiproteases. This review examines how dysregulated protease activity contributes to viral entry, cytokine activation, vascular injury, and thrombosis. We focus on the integration of proteolytic systems such as the renin-angiotensin system, coagulation cascade, and neutrophil extracellular traps with established pathways like endothelial dysfunction and immune hyperactivation. Furthermore, we highlight therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring proteolytic balance and discuss the potential relevance of this paradigm in the management of long COVID.">

We reviewed the mechanisms underlying leukocyte recruitment during flavivirus-induced encephalitis with a focus on the role of various chemoattractants and adhesion molecules. We discuss how these molecules orchestrate the migration of peripheral leukocytes into the brain parenchyma and how neurotropic flaviviruses induce this process. Moreover, we discuss evidence of leukocytes both controlling viral propagation and contributing to neuropathology, which poses a challenge for therapy development.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immune dysfunction in liver disease contributes to significant morbidities, depending on liver damage severity and aetiology. We previously reported long‐lasting generalized CD8 T cell hyperfunction in chronic HCV infection with advanced fibrosis, yet its separation from viral and fibrosis‐driven effects, as well as clinical outcomes of advanced fibrosis, remains unclear. In a murine model of carbon tetrachloride‐induced progressive liver fibrosis, advanced fibrosis was observed by 12 weeks, with pathologies similar to those of human chronic HCV infection. Blood‐circulating CD8 T cells showed IFN‐γ and granzyme B (GrB) hyperfunction in response to anti‐CD3/28 stimulation, as well as impaired responses to ectopic tumour challenge and anti‐PD‐1/CTLA‐4 immunotherapy. Hyperfunction and impaired tumour responses were retained despite liver insult cessation. In a 45% HFD model, which induced steatosis and minimal fibrosis, IFN‐γ and GrB hyperfunction was also observed in blood‐circulating CD8 T cells. This study highlights a prolonged systemic CD8 T cell dysfunction acquired during progressive liver disease, associated with impaired antitumour and immunotherapy responses. These mirror the bulk CD8 T cell dysfunction observed in advanced liver diseases in humans, suggesting that these models could be valuable for future mechanistic studies aimed at identifying targets to help improve clinical outcomes in chronic liver disease.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
This review highlights recent advances in single cell "-omics" technologies that have transformed our understanding of the HIV reservoir in the central nervous system (CNS) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).


RECENT FINDINGS
Recent studies have applied single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CITE-seq, AIRR-seq, multiomic platforms, and spatial transcriptomics to postmortem brain tissues and CSF. These analyses have revealed that HIV persists in rare subsets of CNS-resident microglia and trafficking CD4+ T cells despite ART. Infected microglia often display inflammatory transcriptional states, while clonal T cell populations harboring HIV can migrate between blood and CSF. Spatial and multimodal approaches are uncovering both the tissue localization and epigenetic regulation of infected cells, offering unprecedented insight into reservoir biology and neuropathogenesis.


SUMMARY
Single cell studies have established the CNS as a transcriptionally active and clonally maintained reservoir of HIV during ART. These findings underscore the need for cure strategies that penetrate the brain, target both lymphoid and myeloid reservoirs, and consider the transcriptional, epigenetic and spatial context of HIV-infected cells. Ongoing technological advances will further illuminate the dynamics of the CNS reservoir and guide the design of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers and CNS-penetrant therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Although most patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) experience rapid recovery, some report persistent chronic symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction. One risk factor for prolonged recovery after mTBI is early life stress (ELS). We hypothesized that ELS mediates prolonged cognitive dysfunction after mTBI by exacerbating the NRLP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, and that these effects could be reversed by inhibiting NLRP3. Methods To test this hypothesis, Sprague Dawley rat pups were maternally separated for 3 h daily from P2-P14. Subsequently, the rats underwent a mild-to-moderate fluid percussion brain injury (1.4 atm) or sham surgery during young adulthood and were then treated with either the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 or vehicle. Results We found that ELS significantly increased microglia and macrophage cell numbers within the hippocampus during mTBI recovery. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that the combination of ELS and mTBI significantly increased levels of HMGB1, TLR4, NLRP3, caspase 1, and IL-1β mRNA levels in the ipsilateral hippocampus at 24 h after injury. This upregulation was persistent and TLR4, NLRP3, caspase 1, and IL-1β levels remained elevated for up to 2 months after injury. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 reduced this upregulation both 24 h and 2 months after injury. Hippocampal microglia isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated increased levels of NLRP3 after ELS alone, but not IL-1β. The upregulation in microglial IL-1β required the combination of ELS and mTBI and was ameliorated with MCC950. Additionally, MCC950 treatment improved glucocorticoid receptor downregulation in the hippocampus after ELS, mTBI alone and mTBI + ELS. The combinatory insult of ELS and mTBI also impaired associative fear memory which was prevented with MCC950 treatment. Conclusion In summary, ELS limits recovery after mTBI by upregulating the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling molecules in microglia. Inhibition of NLRP3 is an effective therapeutic for treating chronic cognitive deficits after ELS and mTBI.">

        <tr id="At least 10% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a variety of multisystem symptoms lasting more than 12 wk known as postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or “long COVID.” While the precise pathogenesis of PASC remains unclear, immune dysregulation is widely recognized as a key factor. Moreover, PASC disproportionately affects older individuals who are prone to age-related immune system decline, which further exacerbates the risk and severity of PASC. The oral cavity, a primary site for initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, may contribute to the development and persistence of PASC. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in age-related oral health, such as periodontitis, salivary gland (SG) dysfunction, and gustatory and olfactory impairments, may create an environment conducive to forming an oral reservoir of intact virus or viral antigens, which may contribute to the chronicity of PASC. Alternatively, the pathogenesis of PASC may increase the risk of a wide range of oral health issues, such as dental diseases, dry mouth, and sensory dysfunction (e.g., taste and smell) that are frequently reported by patients with PASC. This review highlights how aging facilitates oral SARS-CoV-2 infection, co-infection with other viruses may drive PASC in aging patients, aging and PASC dysregulate the oral microbiome, SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes molecular mechanisms involved in oral tissue aging, aging oral health affects susceptibility to developing PASC, and inflammation associated with PASC exacerbates dysregulation of metabolic/enzymatic pathways of aging oral mucosa and diseases of the periodontal apparatus, SGs, and taste. It underscores the urgent need to comprehensively address the interplay between aging oral health and PASC, which will help mitigate long-term complications and improve overall health outcomes for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is the leading cause of death globally (49 million cases per year with a 25-30% morbidity and mortality rate), but its immunopathology remains incompletely elucidated. Conventional models of ‘uncontrolled inflammation’ fail to explain the diversity of immune status in patients at different stages of the disease, and there is an urgent need for a dynamic, time-series perspective to reveal key regulatory nodes. Methods Forty-six studies (2014–2024) were retrieved under PRISMA-2020 across 12 databases. Raw single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and CITE-seq matrices (≈1 million immune cells) were uniformly reprocessed, harmonised with scMGNN, and mapped onto pseudotime and RNA-velocity trajectories. Ordinary and stochastic differential-equation models quantified pro-/anti-inflammatory flux. Results Multi-omics fusion increased immune-cell classification accuracy from 72.3% to 89.4% (adjusted Rand index, p< 0.001). Three phase-defining checkpoints emerged: monocyte-to-macrophage fate bifurcation at 16–24 h, initiation of TOX-driven CD8+ T-cell exhaustion at 36–48 h, and irreversible immunosuppression beyond 72 h. Dynamical simulations identified two intervention windows—0–18 h (selective MyD88–NF-κB blockade) and 36–48 h (PD-1/TIM-3 dual inhibition)—forecasting 2.1-fold and 1.6-fold survival gains, respectively, in pre-clinical models. Conclusion In this study, an “immune clock” model of sepsis was constructed based on single-cell multi-omics data, which accurately depicted three key decision nodes, namely, monocyte-macrophage differentiation, initiation of T-cell depletion and irreversible immune suppression, and identified the corresponding molecular targets (e.g., IRF8, TOX).

        <tr id="Long COVID is a persistent post-viral syndrome with the significant involvement of both the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, often extending well beyond the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Emerging evidence has highlighted a spectrum of chronic alterations, including endothelial dysfunction, microvascular inflammation, perivascular fibrosis, and in some cases, the persistence of viral components in the cardiac and pulmonary tissues. At the molecular level, a sustained inflammatory milieu—characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6)—and chronic platelet hyperreactivity contribute to a prothrombotic state. These mechanisms are implicated in microvascular damage, cardiac strain, and impaired gas exchange, correlating with clinical manifestations such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and reduced exercise capacity. In certain patients, especially those who were not hospitalized during the acute phase, cardiac MRI and myocardial biopsy may reveal signs of myocardial inflammation and autonomic dysregulation. These often subclinical cardiovascular alterations underscore the need for improved diagnostic strategies, integrating molecular and histopathological markers during post-COVID evaluations. Recognizing persistent inflammatory and thrombotic activity may inform risk stratification and individualized therapeutic approaches. The interdependence between pulmonary fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care. In this context, molecular and tissue-based diagnostics play a pivotal role in elucidating the long-term cardio-pulmonary sequelae of long COVID and guiding targeted interventions. Early identification and structured follow-up are essential to mitigate the burden of chronic complications in affected individuals.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are crucial components of the immune response against viral infections. SOCS proteins inhibit cytokine signaling through various mechanisms, such as blocking STAT binding to JAKs and targeting proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. While these proteins maintain immune balance by suppressing excessive inflammatory responses, many viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2, exploit SOCS proteins to evade host immunity. In consequence, understanding their modulatory functions in viral disease has become increasingly relevant. Therefore, this review aims to describe and discuss studies involving SOCS expression data in COVID‐19 and their potential modulation as a valuable use for therapeutic strategies.">

BACKGROUND

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with an overactive immune response, contributing to disease severity. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating inflammatory responses during viral infections, including COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES

This computational reanalysis explores the critical involvement of NF-κB signaling, particularly through toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and noncanonical pathways, in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, immune activation, and cytokine storm. We also discuss the crosstalk between NF-κB and other signaling pathways in the context of COVID-19, and summarize current and potential therapeutic strategies targeting NF-κB.

METHODS

An extensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, TLR signaling, NF-κB pathway activation, noncanonical NF-κB signaling, and anti-inflammatory drug interventions were analyzed and synthesized.

RESULTS

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, often facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease activity. This viral entry triggers downstream immune signaling cascades, especially through TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8. TLR engagement activates both canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta. NF-κB signaling exhibits extensive crosstalk with other pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome (NLRP3) activation, contributing to cytokine storm and lung injury. Several pharmacological agents, including corticosteroids, Inhibitor of κB Kinase ( IKK) inhibitors, and repurposed drugs like dexamethasone and resveratrol, show potential in mitigating NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

CONCLUSION

NF-κB signaling serves as a pivotal mediator of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and immune dysregulation. Targeting this pathway—particularly its noncanonical branches and TLR-mediated activation—offers promising therapeutic avenues. Understanding NF-κB crosstalk with other immune pathways may yield synergistic drug targets to improve COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: In late 2019, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic called the ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19). After the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, many individuals (up to 33%) complained of unexplained symptoms involving multiple organ systems and were diagnosed as having Long COVID-19 (LC-19). Currently, LC-19 is inadequately defined, requiring the formation of consistent diagnostic parameters to provide a foundation for ongoing and future studies of epidemiology, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and therapy. LC-19 represents a significant burden on multiple levels. The reduced ability of workers to return to work or compromised work efficiency has led to consequences at national, economic, and societal levels by increasing dependence on community services. On a personal scale, the isolation and helplessness caused by the disease and its subsequent impact on the patient’s mental health and quality of life are incalculable. Methods: In this paper, we used Walker and Avants’ eight-step approach to perform a concept analysis of the term “Long COVID-19” and define its impact across these parameters. Results: Using this methodology, we provide an improved definition of LC-19 by connecting the clinical symptomology with previously under-addressed factors, such as mental, psychological, economic, and social effects. This definition of LC-19 features can help improve diagnostic procedures and help plan relevant healthcare services. Conclusions: LC-19 represents a complex and pressing public health challenge with diverse symptomology, an unpredictable timeline, and complex pathophysiology. This concept analysis serves as a tool for improving LC-19 definition, but it remains a dynamic disease with evolving diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, requiring deeper investigation and understanding of its long-term effects.">

        <tr id="Objectives Platelet–neutrophil aggregates (PNA) bridge inflammatory processes with the hemostatic system. The goal of this study was the comparative evaluation of PNAs in healthy individuals vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), septic patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and a pre-pandemic control group from 2019. Methods This observational study involved prospective blood sample collection from vaccinated individuals at separate times after immunization with Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, together with the retrospective analysis of laboratory data from COVID-19, sepsis, and control subjects. PNA ratios and anti-S-protein antibody levels were also measured. Results Following primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, PNA levels increased significantly, showing a gradual decline over six months while remaining elevated. Booster vaccinations did not elevate PNA levels. In COVID-19 patients PNA ratios were the highest, while in the patients with sepsis remained comparable to those of the control group. A moderate correlation was found between PNA and anti-S-protein levels after primary immunization (rho = 0.31, p = 0.0071), but no correlation was observed post-booster. Strong associations between PNA and platelet counts occurred in COVID-19 and sepsis groups, while leukocyte and neutrophil counts showed no significant correlations with PNA. Conclusions The results of this study may support the possibility of using PNA ratio assessment for the evaluation of the immune response.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Patients with bacterial infections are at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events. Whether infections’ effects on innate immune cells within the cardiovascular system influence subsequent pathologies remains unclear. Here, we explore cardiac myeloid cells’ chronic adaptations to a preceding bacterial insult and implications for subsequent myocardial ischemia. METHODS: We used various flow cytometry protocols to assess cardiac immune cells, peripheral leukocytes, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in bone marrow and spleen. A genetic fate-mapping model was used to determine cardiac macrophages’ origin after bacteremia. Cardiac leukocytes were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing. Nanoparticle-mediated RNA interference was used to target macrophages in vivo. RESULTS: Cardiac macrophage numbers increased sharply, and numerical changes alongside subset alterations persisted over time. Fate-mapping pointed toward local origin as the primary macrophage source after infection. Profiling macrophage heterogeneity using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified two previously unknown subpopulations remaining after resolution of infection. While heightened metabolic activity was one subset’s primary feature, the other displayed excessive chemotactic properties, which amplified cardiac leukocyte recruitment and inflammation after a subsequent ischemic injury. Targeting cardiac macrophages’ surplus inflammatory activity after infection using nanoparticle-enabled, macrophage-directed RNA interference kept disproportionate subsequent ischemic inflammation at bay. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia induces long-lasting changes in the cardiovascular system’s innate immune cells’ composition. This may amplify myocardial inflammation after a subsequent ischemic injury.">

        <tr id="Background: Early-life adversity (ELA) is a significant risk factor for emotional disorders like depression, likely by provoking changes in stress-related circuit development. We have previously shown that ELA increases the number of excitatory synapses onto corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) by decreasing microglial synapse engulfment. Here, we hypothesize that ELA induces microglial dysfunction via inhibition of the microglial phagocytic receptor, MerTK, thus resulting in the observed changes in synapses and stress-related behavior. Methods: To determine whether deleting MerTK in microglia phenocopies the effects of ELA, microglia-specific (m)MerTK-KO (CX3CR1-Cre+::MerTKfl/fl) mice were crossed with ‘wild-type’ (CX3CR1-Cre−::MerTKfl/fl) mice and their litters were reared in either a control or ELA (induced by limited bedding and nesting paradigm) environment, from postnatal days (P)2–10. Excitatory synapses in the PVN were assessed at P10, and adult offspring were tested in a behavioral battery to measure threat-response (known to be dependent on PVN-CRH+neurons) and anxiety-like behavior, followed by acute restraint stress to measure the neuroendocrine stress response. Results: Following ELA at P10, excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses in the PVN were increased in males, which was mimicked by mMerTK-KO in control males, but caused no further increase in ELA males. However, females already had higher numbers of excitatory synapses at baseline, and showed no further increase with ELA or mMerTK-KO. Remarkably, the pattern of threat-response behavior in males closely matched the excitatory synapses, with mMerTK-KO control males escaping more from the simulated predator threat in the looming-shadow threat task, similar to ELA males. Again, females did not show any significant changes due to ELA or mMerTK-KO in the threat-response, although they did show ELA-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior. ELA provoked a greater corticosterone response to acute stress in males, but not females, although females were again higher at baseline. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that ELA provokes increased excitatory synapses in the PVN, leading to an increased active response to threat in the looming-shadow test in males only. Deleting MerTK specifically from microglia recapitulates both the synaptic and behavioral effects in control males, but does not have an effect in ELA males or control females, suggesting that the MerTK pathway is already inhibited by ELA in males and less active in females at baseline. Our work is the first to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the male-biased microglial dysfunction caused by ELA, with promise for the development of better preventative and therapeutic strategies for at-risk children.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a dynamic, context-sensitive process that plays essential roles in brain development, maintenance, and response to injury. It reflects a finely balanced neuroimmune state—facilitating repair and adaptation under homeostatic conditions, while also contributing to dysfunction when dysregulated or chronically activated. In this mini-review, we examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammatory responses, focusing on the roles of microglia and astrocytes, their bidirectional communication with neurons, and their interaction with peripheral immune signals. We describe how various stimuli—including aging, protein aggregates, and cellular stress—modulate glial function and shift immune activity toward protective or deleterious outcomes. Special attention is given to endogenous regulatory pathways, including cytokine signaling, receptor-mediated crosstalk, and immunometabolic cues that determine the resolution or persistence of inflammation. We further discuss shared and disease-specific features of neuroinflammation across neurological disorders, offering a systems-level perspective on how immune activity contributes to neural resilience or degeneration. This integrated view aims to inform future studies on neuroimmune dynamics in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Microglia, resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play an essential role in responding to pathological conditions by adopting diverse activation states and morphologies. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed that microglial subtypes were heterogeneous based on their gene expression profiles. However, the mechanism on how morphological changes in microglia are correlated with their gene expression profiles remains unclear. The current study aimed to identify a distinct population of rod-shaped microglia, characterized by an elongated morphology, in glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCLC)-deficient mice, a model of glutathione deficiency-induced oxidative stress. In the process of brain atrophy accompanied by neuronal cell death, which was observed in GCLC-KO mice, the rod-shaped microglia emerged in early stages of neurodegeneration and subsequently decreased in number over time. C1q-mediated synaptic pruning has been implicated in microglial activation under pathological conditions. Thus, whether C1q contributes to the formation of rod-shaped microglia was investigated. Notably, the genetic deletion of C1q did not affect the number or distribution of rod-shaped microglia in GCLC-KO mice. These findings suggest that their formation occurs via a C1q-independent mechanism. According to morphological and molecular analyses, the gene expression profile of the rod-shaped microglia was similar to that of the disease-associated microglia (DAM). To investigate the mechanisms underlying their formation, single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on cortical tissues collected from GCLC-KO mice. DAM-like microglial clusters were consistently identified. Further, pathway enrichment analysis suggested the potential involvement of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA, encoded by Plau) signaling. Considering the role of uPA in extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration, it may contribute to the morphological changes in rod-shaped microglia. In addition, the phosphorylation of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a modification linked to structural plasticity, increased in rod-shaped microglia. Based on these findings, uPA signaling and phosphorylated GAP43 may be involved in microglial elongation and alignment along neuronal fibers, which potentially facilitate their migration during early neurodegenerative responses. Taken together, the rod-shaped microglia are a previously unrecognized activated population that emerges early in neurodegeneration and may be involved in disease-related processes. Understanding their molecular regulation can provide insights into early microglial responses and potential therapeutic targets.

Many abnormalities were worse following exercise and correlated with the intensity of symptoms. Our findings may inform development of targeted therapeutic interventions for ME/CFS and PEM.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation, meaning an inflammatory process primarily occurring within the central nervous system (CNS), is thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (SC), although existing evidence is sometimes contradictory. This review critically summarizes the existing data on neuroinflammation and possible neuroinflammatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of SC. Despite heterogeneity and inconsistency, the existing evidence indicates dysregulation of inflammatory genes and infiltration of the CNS parenchyma by immune cells, disturbances in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and blood-brain barrier, and activation of microglia and astroglia. Widely documented increases in levels of peripheral inflammatory biomarkers also reflect activation of inflammatory processes in the CNS. Nevertheless, patients differ in the degree of activation of neuroinflammatory processes, indicating the existence of immunophenotypes of SC with and without neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation may be associated with dysregulation of synaptic pruning, impaired neuroplasticity, glymphatic-clearance dysfunction, and white-matter pathology, all of which may ultimately lead to functional brain dysconnectivity and disease manifestation. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and gut-brain axis and disturbances in the kynurenine pathway are the main molecular mechanisms linking peripheral and central inflammation. However, neuroinflammation may not only be associated with negative consequences but also indicate activation of adaptive and reparative processes. Thus, neuroinflammation may be entwined in the pathogenetic mechanisms of SC; therefore, anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies may improve patient care.">

        <tr id="Background. The STING protein is activated by the second messenger cGAMP to promote the innate immune response against infections. Beyond this role, a chronically overactive STING signaling has been described in several disorders. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a hyper-inflammatory response (the cytokine storm) that is in part mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway. Several STING inhibitors may protect from severe COVID-19 by down-regulating several inflammatory cytokines. This pathway has been implicated in the establishment of an optimal antiviral vaccine response. STING agonists as adjuvants improved the IgG titers against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein vaccines. Methods. We investigated the association between two common functional STING1/TMEM173 polymorphisms (rs78233829 C>G/p.Gly230Ala and rs1131769C>T/p.His232Arg) and severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. A total of 801 non-vaccinated and 105 fully vaccinated (mRNA vaccine) patients, as well as 300 population controls, were genotyped. Frequencies between the groups were statistically compared. Results. There were no differences for the STING1 variant frequencies between non-vaccinated patients and controls. Vaccinated patients showed a significantly higher frequency of rs78233829 C (230Gly) compared to non-vaccinated patients (CC vs. CG + GG; p = 0.003; OR = 2.13; 1.29–3.50). The two STING1 variants were in strong linkage disequilibrium, with the rs78233829 C haplotypes being significantly more common in the vaccinated (p = 0.02; OR = 1.66; 95%CI = 1.01–2.55). We also studied the LTZFL1 rs67959919 G/A polymorphism that was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (p < 0.001; OR = 1.83; 95%CI = 1.28–2.63). However, there were no differences between the non-vaccinated and vaccinated patients for this polymorphism. Conclusions. We report a significant association between common functional STING1 polymorphisms and the risk of developing severe COVID-19 among fully vaccinated patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Ischemic stroke frequently leads to white matter injury (WMI), significantly impairing neurological function and recovery. Microglia, the central nervous system's resident immune cells, play a dual role in poststroke pathology and repair. Their diverse activation states and interactions with other glial cells influence demyelination, remyelination, and overall WMI outcomes. To systematically review and synthesize the current evidence regarding the temporal and functional dynamics of microglia in ischemic stroke, with a focus on their roles in white matter damage and recovery. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases (through December 2024) with keywords including “ischemic stroke,” “white matter injury,” “microglia,” “myelin,” and “oligodendrocytes.” Studies involving mechanistic insights into microglial polarization, myelin repair, and associated molecular pathways were prioritized. Both preclinical and clinical studies were reviewed. Results Microglia exhibit distinct activation profiles in acute and chronic phases poststroke. Pro‐inflammatory microglia exacerbate WMI via cytokine secretion and oligodendrocyte toxicity, while immune‐regulatory microglia promote remyelination through trophic support and debris clearance. Key regulatory pathways include TREM2, CX3CR1, and purinergic signaling. Microglial phagocytosis, cytokine production, and interactions with astrocytes critically modulate remyelination. Therapeutic modulation of microglial phenotype (e.g., fingolimod, HDAC inhibitors) shows promise in enhancing white matter repair. Conclusion Microglia exert time‐ and region‐specific effects on WMI after ischemic stroke. A nuanced understanding of their dynamic phenotypes and interactions with other glial elements is essential for developing targeted therapies. Future research should integrate single‐cell technologies, human validation, and sex‐specific analyses to refine microglia‐based interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract INTRODUCTION Growing evidence links gut microbiota (GM) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, a Gram‐negative bacteria component, are found in AD brains, but how LPS breaches the blood–brain barrier (BBB) remains unclear. Hypotheses suggest that bacteria‐derived extracellular vesicles (bEVs) may transport LPS across the BBB. METHODS bEVs were extracted from human and mouse feces and blood, and LPS levels were measured. In vivo imaging and immunofluorescence confirmed the transport of blood LPS‐carrying bEVs across the BBB. The role of these bEVs in microglia was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS Elevated LPS‐containing bEVs were detected in the plasma of AD patients compared to healthy individuals. These bEVs activated microglial Piezo1, consequently precipitating an excessive synaptic pruning process mediated by the C1q‐C3 complement pathway. DISCUSSION These findings illuminate the complex interplay between the gut microbiota, bEVs, neuroinflammation, and synaptic plasticity – a key early event in AD – offering insights for potential therapeutic interventions. Highlights GM‐derived bEVs can traverse the BBB. LPS was necessary for bEVs’ penetration into the brain, and bEVs might be closely related to AD progression. bEVs mediated microglial activation and synaptic pruning via C1q‐C3 complement pathway. Microglia Piezo1 was involved in bEV‐induced excessive synaptic pruning.">

Our findings revealed that COVID-19 and HIV exhibit a partially similar cellular composition and cell cycle distribution. Additionally, we identified a common pathogenesis in B-cell subsets of COVID-19 and HIV patients, which showed abnormal activation states of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. Although amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been the historical hallmarks of AD pathology, growing evidence highlights microglial-mediated neuroinflammation as a central driver of disease onset and progression. This review aims to provide an updated overview of the dual roles of microglia in AD, from their protective functions to their contribution to chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration. Methods: This review synthesizes findings from recent experimental and clinical studies to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying microglial activation and dysfunction in AD. Key areas of focus include microglial signaling pathways, gut–brain axis interactions, and immunometabolic regulation. The review also evaluates emerging immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies designed to restore microglial homeostasis. Results: Recent studies reveal that microglia undergo a dynamic transition from a homeostatic to a reactive state in AD, contributing to sustained neuroinflammation and impaired clearance of pathological aggregates. Molecular mechanisms such as TREM2 signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and metabolic reprogramming play critical roles in this process. Additionally, gut microbiota alterations and systemic inflammation have been shown to influence microglial function, further exacerbating disease pathology. Conclusions: Targeting microglial dysfunction through immunomodulatory strategies holds promise as a disease-modifying approach in AD. Therapeutic avenues under investigation include natural compounds, synthetic modulators, immunotherapies, and microbiota-based interventions. A deeper mechanistic understanding of microglial regulation may open new translational pathways for the development of effective treatments for AD.">

However, the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke remains complex and poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed the infiltration of γδ T cells within ischemic stroke lesions, accompanied by the upregulation of IL-17, IL-23, and other inflammatory cytokines, suggesting their involvement in the stroke’s pathological process. Literature indicates that γδ T cells are recruited to the lesion site by microglia-derived chemokines and subsequently infiltrate the damaged brain tissue. This review summarizes current knowledge on the precise mechanisms underlying γδ T cell activation, migration, and ensuing immune-inflammatory responses in neuroinflammation, as well as their role in the progression of ischemic stroke. It further discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting γδ T cells to modulate neuroinflammation for ischemic stroke treatment, thereby offering novel therapeutic targets for managing neuroinflammation in this condition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aging is a complex biological process that significantly impacts the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes, critical support cells in the brain, undergo senescence with age, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. While previous studies have utilized murine models to investigate astrocyte senescence, human astrocytes offer a more physiologically relevant system to study age‐related neurodegenerative changes. This study presents a novel protocol for inducing senescence in both human primary and murine astrocytes using a combination of cellular stressors, such as lactacystin, H2O2, rotenone, and doxorubicin. Our results demonstrate that doxorubicin treatment effectively induces a robust senescent phenotype in both human and murine astrocytes, characterized by increased expression of senescence markers such as p21 and β‐galactosidase, along with activation of the DNA damage response (γ‐H2AX and 53BP1). Doxorubicin treatment increased nuclear size and induced cell cycle arrest in astrocytes, as revealed by reduced BrdU incorporation and decreased cell density, without inducing cytotoxic effects. This phenotype is accompanied by a pronounced pro‐inflammatory profile, with elevated expression of cytokines including MMP3, IL‐6, and IL‐1β, indicative of a strong senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These findings provide a novel in vitro model for murine and human astrocyte senescence induced by doxorubicin, highlighting its relevance for studying mechanisms underlying age‐related neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. By establishing a robust model of human astrocyte senescence, this study provides a valuable tool for exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving age‐related neurodegenerative processes, serving as an alternative approach to traditional murine models.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong condition that begins when the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This review examines the potential role of common viral infections in triggering or accelerating this autoimmune response. Key findings include that enteroviruses, especially Coxsackie B viruses, show the strongest association with new-onset type 1 diabetes. Other viruses—including mumps, rubella, rotavirus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2—have also been linked, though less consistently. Interestingly, some infections, such as cytomegalovirus or chickenpox, may even delay disease onset. Viruses may influence disease development by directly damaging pancreatic beta cells or by triggering immune confusion through molecular mimicry, where viral proteins resemble human ones. While no single virus is definitively proven to cause the disease, infections appear to accelerate or precipitate diabetes in genetically at-risk individuals. Understanding these interactions could support vaccine development, antiviral therapies, and early screening programs. Such approaches may help reduce the incidence or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes and its burden on individuals and healthcare systems.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Clinical studies have reported the association between depression and inflammation. Rodent studies have demonstrated that chronic stress activates microglia, leading to neuronal dysfunctions and depression-related behaviors via proinflammatory molecules. However, since previous studies have relied on a limited number of microglial activation markers, the entire view of stress-induced microglial response remains elusive. Thus, essential questions, such as how differently microglia respond to acute and chronic stress, how differently microglia respond to stress among individuals, and what determines these properties of microglial responses, are also unanswered. Aims & Objectives Using a rodent model of social defeat stress, combined with multiomics analyses and genetic manipulations, we investigated the specific characteristics of stress that drive microglial responses, their molecular mechanisms, and their impact on behavior. Method We subjected male C57BL/6N mice to acute or chronic social defeat stress. We categorized the mice after chronic social defeat stress into susceptible and resilient mice according to the level of social avoidance, a typical depression-related behavior. Then, we isolated microglia from multiple brain areas of these mice, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), primary sensory and motor cortices, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and hypothalamus, and subjected these cells to single-cell RNA-seq. In addition, we more deeply analyzed the transcriptome of microglia from the mPFC and NAc, two representative brain areas with distinct responses to social defeat stress, with bulk RNA seq. We then predicted transcription factors responsible for stress-induced changes in the microglial transcriptome and examined their functional significance using genetic and surgical manipulations. Results Single-cell RNA-seq revealed that acute stress altered microglial transcriptome in all the examined brain regions. The microglial transcriptome was further changed with chronic stress in susceptible mice but returned to the original state in resilient mice. Microglial transcriptome also varied among brain regions and even more after stress. Thus, microglial transcriptome manifested chronic stress selectivity, stress susceptibility selectivity, and brain region selectivity. Clustering analysis revealed that gene expressions selective to chronic stress and those selective to stress susceptibility were mostly segregated and that brain region selectivity emerged within the former gene expressions. Nonetheless, these selectivities coincided in the same microglial clusters. Bulk RNA-seq analysis of mPFC and NAc microglia reproduced the segregation of chronic stress and stress susceptibility selectivities. Epigenomic analyses with H3K27ac ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq predicted distinct transcription factors for the respective gene expressions. Surgical and genetic manipulations suggested that gene expressions selective to chronic stress and stress susceptibility are mediated by different molecular pathways and involved in distinct behavioral domains. Discussion & Conclusions These findings demonstrate that microglia integrate chronic stress, stress susceptibility, and brain region selectivity in their gene expression through distinct molecular pathways, causing multiple neural dysfunctions and aggravating stress-related mental illness.">

        <tr id="PANoptosis is a newly recognized form of programmed inflammatory cell death implicated in numerous inflammation-related diseases. However, its precise role and underlying mechanisms in periodontitis (PD) remain unclear.We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on gingival tissues from PD patients and healthy individuals to profile cellular composition and quantify cell-type distributions. Functional enrichment analyses were used to explore PANoptosis and related pathways, with five gene set scoring methods applied to quantify PANoptosis activity in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). The expression of PANoptosis-related markers was validated by immunofluorescence staining and qPCR in HGFs and gingival tissues from PD model mice. Based on PANoptosis scores, HGFs were stratified into high- and low-activity groups. Cell-cell communication and spatial transcriptomic analyses were integrated to examine their interactions with immune cells in the periodontal microenvironment. Finally, bulk RNA-seq data were subjected to comprehensive analysis using 113 machine learning models to screen for core PANoptosis-associated genes, which were subsequently validated through qPCR and immunohistochemistry in gingival tissues.scRNA-seq analysis revealed a decreased proportion of HGFs alongside enrichment of multiple PANoptosis-related pathways in PD samples. Further assessment demonstrated significantly elevated PANoptosis activity in HGFs from PD compared to controls, which was validated by tissue-level immunofluorescence staining. In vitro experiments using cultured HGFs and in vivo analyses in PD model mice further confirmed upregulation of PANoptosis-related markers via immunofluorescence and qPCR. Upon stratifying HGFs into high- and low-PANoptosis groups, cell-cell communication and spatial transcriptomic analyses indicated that high-PANoptosis HGFs exhibited enhanced interactions with immune cells within the periodontal microenvironment. Additionally, bulk transcriptomic profiling combined with machine learning approaches identified four key PANoptosis-associated genes, which were subsequently validated in human gingival tissues.Our findings demonstrate that PANoptosis is activated in HGFs in the context of PD, which may drive immune dysregulation and facilitate disease progression. By integrating bulk transcriptomic data with machine learning algorithms, we identified and validated key PANoptosis-related genes, highlighting their potential as novel therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Mpox poses a heightened risk of severe disease and mortality among individuals with HIV, yet the molecular mechanisms and immunopathology underlying multi-organ damage caused by the mpox virus (MPXV), particularly in the context of HIV co-infection, remain poorly understood. Here, we observe increased MPXV replication, more extensive skin lesions, and impaired humoral and cellular immune responses in SIV-MPXV co-infected rhesus macaques compared to those infected with MPXV alone. Multi-organ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveals upregulation of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory pathways in skin lesions and across multiple organs, especially in immune-related tissues. Abnormal activation of DNA replication and cell cycle signaling pathways, which may contribute to enhanced viral replication, is evident in both MPXV and SIV-MPXV co-infected groups. CDK4/6 may present a potential therapeutic target to suppress MPXV replication. These comprehensive proteomic datasets offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of MPXV in the context of SIV co-infection and support ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of mpox.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute myocarditis (AM), particularly fulminant myocarditis (FM), is an infrequent but life-threatening cardiac inflammation, with limited effective precision-targeted treatments available. This urgent clinical challenge has prompted further investigations into the mechanisms underlying this pathology to develop novel therapeutic approaches.


METHODS
We enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with AM (24 mild, 16 fulminant) between December 2022 and November 2023. Using a multi-omics approach, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma-integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing, cytometry by time of flight, and Olink proteomics to identify specific pathogenic immune subsets and molecular alterations. In vitro experiments validated the function and inducing signals of identified pathogenic subsets. In coxsackievirus B3-induced FM mice, cytometry by time of flight analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cardiac infiltrating immune cells. Pharmacological blockade of key molecular was tested to assess potential therapeutic efficacy.


RESULTS
We identified that a specialized type of CD8+ effector T cells, CD57+CD8+ T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, were significantly enriched and exhibited large clonal expansion in AM. Differential expression analysis revealed upregulation of natural killer-like receptor genes in CD57+CD8+ effector T cells from FM compared with mild cases, which was positively associated with enhanced cytotoxicity and migration potential. In vitro experiments confirmed the existence of circulating CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxic degranulation and migration potential inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis, supporting their cardiac migration and cardiomyocyte cytotoxicity in pathogenesis. Elevated circulating interleukin (IL)-18 levels in patients with AM induced the functional differentiation of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In addition, increased proinflammatory CXCL8+CD14+ monocytes potentially contributed to increasing IL-18 levels and crosstalk with CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In FM mice, we observed the analogous expansions of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells and CXCL2+LY6C+ monocytes in both blood and hearts, accompanied by elevated plasma IL-18 levels. Disrupting the pathogenic axis involving proinflammatory monocytes, IL-18 signaling, and CCR5-mediated cardiac recruitment significantly alleviated FM in mice.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides a comprehensive immune landscape for understanding the pathogenesis of AM, especially in FM, highlighting clonal CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, along with their upstream inflammatory signals, as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating immune-related cardiac damage in AM management, especially in FM.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the critical need for broad-spectrum antivirals with high resistance barriers. Here, we demonstrate that SB431542, a selective TGF-β receptor I (ALK5) inhibitor, exhibits potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through unprecedented multitargeted mechanisms. Through comprehensive in vitro, isothermal titration calorimetry, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupts its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36-48 hours post-infection [hpi]), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-β-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release-processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 751.8 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favorable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-β/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-β-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection, collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development.


IMPORTANCE
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the urgent need for antiviral drugs with high barriers to resistance. This study reveals that SB431542, a drug previously developed to inhibit TGF-β signaling, exhibits remarkable effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 through an unprecedented triple-mechanism approach. Unlike conventional antivirals that target a single viral component, SB431542 simultaneously disrupts viral entry, assembly, and release by binding to the viral ORF3a protein and modulating host cellular processes. Most importantly, SARS-CoV-2 failed to develop resistance against SB431542 even after 50 generations of exposure-a significant advantage over current therapeutics that quickly lose effectiveness due to viral mutations. Our findings also uncover that coronaviruses exploit both lysosomal dysfunction and programmed cell death to spread efficiently, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. This research establishes SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor and demonstrates the value of targeting host-virus interactions to overcome antiviral resistance.">

        <tr id="Background COVID-19-associated sepsis poses unique challenges in intensive care units (ICUs), where patients are often immunocompromised and prone to secondary bacterial infections. Differentiating immune phenotypes between pure viral and viral-bacterial sepsis is essential for timely diagnosis and personalized treatment. Objective To compare clinical characteristics, immune profiles, and outcomes between patients with pure COVID-19 sepsis and those complicated by confirmed secondary bacterial infection, and to identify immune markers capable of differentiating sepsis phenotypes. Methods This retrospective cohort study enrolled ICU patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia between July 2021 and December 2023. Patients were classified into viral sepsis (V group, n=53) and viral-bacterial sepsis (VB group, n=28) based on microbiological confirmation of secondary infection. Clinical data, inflammatory markers, cytokine levels, and neutrophil CD64 expression (via flow cytometry) were analyzed. Logistic regression, ROC curves, and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis were used to evaluate phenotypes, identify discriminative markers, and assess outcomes. Results The VB group exhibited significantly higher SOFA scores (median 9.5 vs 7, P<0.001), serum creatinine (103.2 vs 80.85 µmol/L, P=0.001), and LDH levels (531 vs 392 U/L, P=0.009), indicating more severe organ dysfunction. ICU stay was longer in the VB group (median 16 vs 13 days, P=0.027), and ICU mortality was slightly higher (85.7% vs 83.0%, P=0.785). Immune profiling showed significantly higher IL-2 (36.8 vs 22.1 pg/mL, P<0.001), IL-10, IFN-γ, and MYD88 in the V group, whereas TNF-α (62.3 vs 43.7 pg/mL, P=0.002) and PCT (2.51 vs 1.12 ng/mL, P=0.001) were higher in the VB group. IL-2, MYD88, and PCT independently discriminated phenotypes. Neutrophil CD64 showed strong predictive value for superinfection (AUC=0.969). Conclusion COVID-19 patients with secondary bacterial sepsis exhibit distinct immune and clinical profiles. Immune phenotyping may enable early recognition of bacterial superinfection and guide phenotype-driven therapy in severe viral sepsis. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06491966.

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis (LN), a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), involves complex immune dysregulation that leads to chronic renal inflammation and progressive tissue damage. Despite decades of use of standard immunosuppressive therapy, treatment responses remain variable, and many patients experience relapses or develop end-stage renal disease. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the immunopathogenesis of LN, drawing on studies from single-cell transcriptomics, signaling pathway analyses and renal tissue immunology. It examines the role of both innate and adaptive immune cells in mediating disease. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving with novel biologics targeting B cell survival and cytokine signaling, small-molecule inhibitors modulating intracellular pathways, and promising developments in cell-based interventions. Notably, recent clinical case series have demonstrated that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable drug-free remission in LN, representing a transformative approach to immune modulation. These advances are further supported by the application of multi-omics platforms to refine biomarker-driven disease monitoring and personalized treatment. Integrating immunologic and technological innovations holds the potential to redefine therapeutic strategies in LN. Precision medicine approaches that leverage targeted therapies, immune resetting modalities, and biomarker-guided clinical decisions may significantly improve long-term renal outcomes and patient quality of life.">

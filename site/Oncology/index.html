        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Development of therapeutic approaches that target specific microglia responses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is crucial due to the involvement of microglia in ALS progression. Our study identifies the predominant microglia subset in human ALS primary motor cortex and spinal cord as an undifferentiated phenotype with dysregulated respiratory electron transport. Moreover, we find that the interferon response microglia subset is enriched in donors with aggressive disease progression, while a previously described potentially protective microglia phenotype is depleted in ALS. Additionally, we observe an enrichment of non-microglial immune cell, mainly NK/T cells, in the ALS central nervous system, primarily in the spinal cord. These findings pave the way for the development of microglia subset-specific therapeutic interventions to slow or even stop ALS progression.

        <tr id="Introduction During gestation the immune system undergoes dramatic remodelling to protect the maternal-fetal dyad from infections whilst also preventing fetal rejection. We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 modifies the immune landscape during infection and in recovered pregnant women. Methods We immunophenotyped our two independent geographical cohorts using a 14-colour flow cytometry panel (surface and intracellular staining). We estimated cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in validation cohort using a multiplexd flow cytometry panel. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed using a Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead Chip and Library Kit from 10x Genomics (Drop-seq method). Furthermore, we estimated the cytotoxic functions of natural killer (NK) cells by flow cytometry using surface and intracellular staining. Results Using two independent geographical cohorts, we identified that NK cells had a sustained reduction during active infection and after recovery. Further, scRNA-seq data revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 rewired the gene expression profile of NK, monocytes, CD4+, CD8+ effector T cells and antibody producing B cells in convalescent pregnant women. Several gene pathways associated with cytotoxic function, interferon signalling type I & II, and pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were attenuated in recovered pregnant patients compared with healthy pregnancies. We validated our scRNA-seq of NK cells from convalescent pregnant women and confirmed that NK cells had diminished levels of cytotoxic proteins; perforin, CD122 and granzyme B. Discussion Overall, our study uncovers that SARS-CoV-2 infection deranges the adaptive immune response in pregnant women even after recovery and may contribute to post-COVID19 sequalae of symptoms.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations have been increasingly reported in COVID-19 patients. Here, we use the Drosophila melanogaster midgut model to investigate SARS-CoV-2-induced GI pathogenesis. The fly midgut exhibits susceptibility to orally administered virus, resulting in disrupted epithelial architecture, reduced organ size, and altered visceral muscle dynamics. These effects are accompanied by sustained proliferation of intestinal stem cells alongside decreased replenishment and viability of differentiated cells. Transcriptomic profiling reveals biphasic perturbations in midgut gene expression, particularly in pathways related to lipid metabolism. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dichotomous effect on lipid homeostasis, with lipid droplet accumulation in the posterior midgut and depletion in anterior segments. Treatment with Plitidepsin, a COVID-19 drug candidate, mitigates most SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic features in both the Drosophila midgut and human pulmonary cells, while modulating basal lipid droplet homeostasis in uninfected conditions. These findings establish the Drosophila midgut as a potent model for studying SARS-CoV-2 GI pathogenesis and evaluating antiviral compounds.">

        <tr id="Viral infection triggers both cellular and systemic responses in vivo. These are sometimes difficult to study since the immune system is subject to constant challenge from multiple pathogens. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique opportunity arose to measure the body’s immune response during lockdown, when exposure to pathogens from the environment was substantially lower. This allowed measurement of COVID-naïve patients, as well as those who had recovered from COVID-19. The effects of subsequent vaccination and boosters could also be assessed. This offers two advantages; an insight into the humoral response to novel pathogens, and the opportunity to measure the ability of the body to respond to challenge from both new pathogens and those to which exposure had already occurred. In this paper, we used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to analyze the electrophysiological fingerprint of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors who had never had COVID-19, those who had recovered from COVID-19, and those who received first, second, or third vaccine doses. This was performed before and after incubation with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to determine whether differential changes in the electrical properties of PBMCs could be detected and evaluated. Clear trends in response over time were observed, suggesting that DEP could pave the way towards a new correlate of protection (CoP) to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, since the test measures immune response to challenge, it may be widely applicable to other diseases.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Analyzing the antiviral response of natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes is essential to understanding vaccine protection in an immunized population facing SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections (BTIs). In this study, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections, we observed an increase in adaptive CD57+NKG2C+ NK cells and classical monocytes (CMs). Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that the transcriptomic profiles of IFN-induced IFIT3 and other IFN-stimulated genes exhibited marked upregulation in NK cells, defined as CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+IFIT3+ NK cells. Additionally, CM in the blood showed characteristics indicative of differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which further evidenced their potential antiviral functions. Our study indicates that a vaccinated population rapidly activates an antiviral innate immune response following a BTI, thus revealing a link to the control of viral replication during SARS-CoV-2 BTIs.">

        <tr id="Exposure to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or Canarypox ALVAC/Alum vaccine elicits pro- or antiinflammatory innate responses, respectively. We tested whether prior exposure of macaques to these immunogens protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lungs and found more efficient replication control after the pro-inflammatory immunity elicited by BCG. The decreased virus level in lungs was linked to early infiltrates of classical monocytes producing IL-8 with systemic neutrophils, Th2 cells, and Ki67+CD95+CD4+ T cells producing CCR7. At the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, BCG-treated animals had higher frequencies of lung infiltrating neutrophils and higher CD14+ cells expressing efferocytosis marker MERTK, responses correlating with decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung. At the same time point, plasma IL-18, TNF-α, TNFSF-10, and VEGFA levels were also higher in the BCG group and correlated with decreased virus replication. Finally, after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, decreased virus replication correlated with neutrophils producing IL-10 and CCR7 preferentially recruited to the lungs of BCG-vaccinated animals. These data point to the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of functional monocytes and neutrophils in controlling SARS-CoV-2 levels and suggest a central role of monocyte efferocytosis in curbing replication.">

        <tr id="Identification of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection typically relies on serology, yet T-cells play a key role in the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated in parallel the SARS-CoV-2-specific as well as endemic human coronavirus-specific humoral and cross-reactive cellular responses in children and adults. We analyzed clinical data and blood samples from a family cohort of 96 children and 144 adults at 3–4 and 11–12 months after their first contact with SARS-CoV-2. Humoral response was assessed by a multiplex immunoassay with high sensitivity and specificity (MULTICOV-AB). Cellular responses were analyzed by IFN-γ ELISPOT using four different established epitope compositions (ECs) to discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 specific and HCoV cross-reactive T-cell responses. While the majority of adults had a combined serological and T-cell response, relatively more children had a T-cell response alone rather than a combined response. The magnitude of the T-cell response correlated with symptoms and the humoral response. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly boosted the endemic coronavirus-specific cellular response. Overall, our data suggest discordant humoral and cellular responses, reflecting either abortive infection, cellular sensitization with rapid viral clearance or rapid antibody waning or a combination of these phenomena. Restricting epidemiologic analysis to SARS-CoV-2 serological data may underestimate rates of infection with or at least exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in children.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes provide physical and metabolic support for neurons, regulate the blood–brain barrier, and react to injury, infection, and disease. When astrocytes become reactive, maintenance of the inflammatory state and its functional implications throughout chronic neuroinflammation are all poorly understood. Several models of acute inflammation have revealed astrocyte subpopulations that go beyond a two‐activation state model, instead encompassing distinct functional subsets. However, how reactive astrocyte (RA) subsets evolve over time during chronic inflammatory disease or infection has been difficult to address. Here we use a prolific human pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, that causes lifelong infection in the brain alongside a Lcn2CreERT2 reporter mouse line to examine reactive astrocyte subsets during chronic neuroinflammation. Single‐cell RNA sequencing revealed diverse astrocyte populations including transcriptionally unique Lcn2CreERT2+ RAs which change over the course of infection in a subset‐dependent manner. In addition to an immune‐regulating Lcn2CreERT2+ astrocyte population enriched with gene transcripts encoding chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and receptors CCR7 and IL7R, a specific subset of Lcn2CreERT2+ astrocytes highly expressed transthyretin (Ttr), a secreted carrier protein involved in glycolytic enzyme activation and potential vasculature regulation and angiogenesis. These findings provide novel information about the evolution and diversity of reactive astrocyte subtypes and functional signatures at different stages of infection, revealing an undocumented role for transthyretin‐expressing astrocytes in immune regulation at the central nervous system (CNS) vasculature.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to global consequences since its emergence in late 2019, impacting health, economies, and societies worldwide. Understanding the early responses following infection will provide crucial insights into the immune mechanisms governing disease progression and protection. We employed the single-cell RNA-sequencing approach using bronchoalveolar lavage cells of rhesus macaques at 0-3 days post-infection (dpi) in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show the increased abundance of two subsets of macrophages that express IFN-responsive gene signatures, inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and conventional DCs at 3 dpi, coinciding with peak viremia. Moreover, our investigation underscores the enrichment of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-1 signaling pathways within myeloid populations at 2-3 dpi in comparison to baseline. These findings substantially deepen our comprehension, elucidating the transcriptional landscape at the single-cell level during the early phases of COVID-19 within a highly relevant model.


IMPORTANCE
Understanding the immune response in the early stages of COVID-19 is crucial for developing better treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the first few days after infection. We identify key immune cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that are activated early on and produce important signals to fight the virus. These findings help clarify how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights that could guide future therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a heterogeneous infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The distinctive features of COVID-19 infection encompass a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe illness involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes such as hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathies, and multiple organ failure. However, the host responses to COVID-19, including systemic inflammation and immunity against SARS-CoV-2, remain largely undefined across different disease states. Here, we performed global transcriptome profiling of 228 peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations and subsequent clustering using an unsupervised algorithm. We identified various transcriptomic clusters and globally dysregulated immune-related pathways, leading to distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles in severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This underscores the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release. Additionally, our results reveal variances in circulating cell populations and the activation of apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients with diverse clinical presentations offers valuable insights into molecular mechanisms and may inform clinical decisions on anti-inflammatory therapies.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is primarily known as a respiratory disease. The continued study of the disease has shown that long-term COVID-19 symptoms include persisting effects of the virus on the brain when the infection is over, possibly even leading to neurodegeneration. However, the exact mechanisms of nervous system damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear. In this study, we focused on two possibly shared pathways of SARS-CoV-2-induced neural dysfunction and neurodegeneration: protein aggregation, which is associated with impaired protein clearance, and inflammatory responses, which involve a hyper-active immune status. We observed distinct expression and distribution patterns of ten SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the two cell lines, meanwhile forming aggregation puncta and inducing pro-inflammatory responses. We found that the ER stress was induced and that the autophagy-lysosome pathway was inhibited upon viral protein expression. Boosting autophagy function attenuated protein aggregation, suggesting that modulation of autophagy might be a valid strategy for inhibiting cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV- 2 proteins. Our study provides potential explanations of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell damage, based on shared cellular mechanisms and furthermore, suggests that modulation of proteostasis may serve as therapeutic strategies for preventing long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 cytotoxic effects.">

        <tr id="Background Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuron loss. Although its genetic and molecular underpinnings have been increasingly studied, the pathways driving PD progression remain unclear. The integrated stress response (ISR), a conserved mechanism activated by cellular stress, has been linked to several neurological diseases, but its role in PD and the key ISR-related genes involved are still poorly understood. Materials and Methods We used publicly available transcriptomic data from GEO, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, to identify ISR-related genes involved in PD progression. ISR scores were compared across brain cell types, and differentially expressed genes in microglia were further screened using Lasso regression and random forest algorithms. Enrichment analyses (GSEA and GSVA) revealed their involvement in immune-related pathways. CIBERSORT was applied to assess immune cell infiltration, while spatial transcriptomics mapped the regional expression of key genes. Finally, DDIT4 expression was validated in PD cell and mouse models. Results We identified four key ISR-related genes (DDIT4, GNA13, HSPA1B, and SLC7A5) that were differentially expressed in PD microglia. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were predominantly involved in immune-related signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, NF-κB, and Notch, suggesting their potential role in regulating neuroinflammation. Spatial transcriptomics revealed distinct regional expression patterns of these ISR-related genes across brain tissues. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the upregulation of DDIT4 in PD models, and its silencing alleviated neurotoxicity and reduced α-synuclein aggregation, highlighting its potential role in PD pathogenesis. Conclusion This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PD and highlights DDIT4 as a promising therapeutic target. Its regulatory role in immune signaling and cellular stress pathways may offer novel avenues for clinical intervention and personalized treatment strategies in PD.">

        <tr id="Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections involve prolonged viral replication and immune system interactions, potentially driving viral evolution and immune escape. This study examines viral characteristics and host gene expression changes in persistent infections. The nasopharyngeal samples from four patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections at Tottori University Hospital, Japan, were analyzed. Viral isolates were cultured, and infectivity was assessed using TCID50 assays. To investigate host responses, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis mapped affected biological pathways. Viral genome sequencing detected mutations associated with prolonged infection. The results showed significant infectivity differences between early- and late-phase infection. Gene expression analysis revealed a strong early phase of pro-inflammatory response (IL6, TNF, IL1B, CXCL10) followed by immune suppression. GO enrichment analysis highlighted inflammation and cytokine-mediated immune pathways. Genomic sequencing identified mutations in ORF1ab and the spike (S) protein, potentially aiding immune escape. The findings underscore that SARS-CoV-2 adapts during persistent infections, altering infectivity and immune responses. These highlight the need for continued monitoring of prolonged infections to mitigate immune escape and viral evolution.">

        <tr id="Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) brain injury, a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, severely affects the metabolically active and neurogenic hippocampus. To investigate its acute effects and identify drug targets for early therapeutic windows, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing on postnatal day 8 (P8) mouse hippocampi under sham, hypoxic, and hypoxic-ischemic conditions. We constructed a comprehensive hippocampal cell atlas and developed a machine-learning classifier for precise cell type identification. Our analysis reveals early vulnerabilities in mature neurons and notable resilience in immature DG, GABAergic, and Cajal-Retzius cells following H-I. Gene regulatory network analysis identified key transcription factors associated with neuronal vulnerability, along with upregulated ribosome biogenesis and dysregulated calcium homeostasis pathways. We observed rapid activation of astrocytes and microglia, with Runx1 identified as a potential key transcription factor associated with early microglia immune responses. Endothelial cells displayed complex transcriptional changes and predicted intercellular signaling patterns that may influence vascular repair and recovery. Our study advances the understanding of immediate cellular and transcriptional responses to neonatal H-I injury, providing new insights into hippocampal cell heterogeneity and pathophysiology.

        <tr id="Purpose Cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significant variability, yet the role of innate immune responses in the skin of COVID-19 patients remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic profile of skin samples from patients who succumbed to COVID-19. Patients and Methods Skin autopsies from COVID-19 patients with post-mortem time of less than 20 hours were obtained from University of São Paulo Medical School Hospital and healthy skin samples, were submitted to RNA sequencing analysis. Validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by real-Time PCR. Results Our analysis revealed markedly elevated expression of type I interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral factors, antioxidant enzymes, and components of several cytokine-signaling pathways in COVID-19 skin samples compared to healthy controls. SARS-CoV-2 infection robustly induced numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFITs, IRF, S100 family with a notable enrichment of those associated with antiviral and inflammatory responses. Moreover, the presence of counter-regulatory factors such as SOCS3 and NFKBIA indicate the involvement of anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the skin. Furthermore, deconvolution data indicated increased presence of macrophages other nucleated cells in vessels in the skin of COVID-19 patients, highlighting the involvement of innate immune mechanisms. Conclusion The results revealed cutaneous alterations in the expression of genes associated with innate immunity and inflammation factors. This suggests that, unlike tissues with viral tropism, the skin is enriched with antiviral factors to defend against SARS-CoV-2. This information could be useful for developing specific antiviral therapies.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic pathogen linked to neuropathogenesis in adults, causing conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and fatal encephalitis. Intracranial injection of virus in immunocompromised mice have shown neuroinflammation and subsequent brain damage. However, the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-induced neuroinflammation in immunocompetent adult mice via peripheral infection remain unclear. To investigate this, we utilized a murine model of ZIKV infection via footpad injection. Our findings reveal that acute ZIKV infection at 4 days post-infection (4 dpi) induces significant apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the adult brain, persisting up to 28 dpi. Notably, ZIKV infection triggers apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex—key regions involved in memory—and induces early immune cell infiltration. Additionally, microglial activation occurs following infection at 7 dpi, with viral RNA detected in the brain. Bulk RNA sequencing of the hippocampus at 28 dpi further reveals the activation of inflammatory pathways, underscoring the prolonged neuroinflammatory response in the infected brain. Microglial activation is likely driven by infiltrating monocytes, as inhibiting monocyte recruitment reduced the expression of microglial activation genes. These results suggest that targeting monocyte-induced inflammatory mediators could be potential therapeutic interventions for ZIKV.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has underscored the need to understand the virus’s evolution due to its global health impact. This study employed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to analyze gene expression differences across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with IDs GSE157103, GSE171110, GSE189039, and GSE201530, which contain RNA-Seq data extracted from white blood cells, whole blood, or PBMCs of individuals infected with the Original Wuhan variant (both hospitalized and non-hospitalized), the French variant (hospitalized), the Beta variant (hospitalized), and the Omicron variant (moderate and mild cases), along with COVID-negative controls. Our first objective was to examine differences in gene expression dynamics using Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-Likelihood F-tests and the Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (GLMQL-MAS) technique, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. Our second objective was to employ Cross-MAS to identify a robust set of genes indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the variant and to assess their classification performance. GO and pathway analyses revealed a significant evolutionary shift in how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host. Early variants such as the Original Wuhan and French cases primarily affected pathways related to viral replication, including Eukaryotic Translation Elongation and Viral mRNA Translation. In contrast, later variants like Beta and Omicron showed a strategic shift toward modulating and evading the host immune response, engaging immune-related pathways such as Interferon Alpha/Beta signaling and Cytokine signaling in the immune system. To evaluate the classification potential of the identified genes, we tested them on held-out datasets GSE152418, PMC8202013, GSE161731, and GSE166190, which contain RNA-Seq data from whole blood or PBMCs of COVID-positive and healthy individuals. Using top-ranked genes such as IFI27, CDC20, RRM2, HJURP, and CDC45 in linear models including logistic regression and linear SVM, we achieved 97.31% accuracy, with precision and recall rates of 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. These signatures also achieved perfect classification (100% accuracy, precision, and recall) in two additional datasets: GSE294888, which includes blood-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (DC2s) stimulated with Delta or Omicron variants, and GSE239595, which features Omicron-infected nasopharyngeal tissue. These findings demonstrate the potential of transcriptomic signatures for variant-agnostic COVID-19 detection and provide a foundation for flexible diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in response to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple mechanisms of immunity must be coordinated to defend against a comprehensive range of pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which broad-spectrum antipathogens act remain largely elusive. Here, we employed systems biology approaches to understand the organization of human immune cells at the single-cell level, as well as their reorganization in response to K21, a silane derivative effective against viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. K21 induced pro-inflammatory pathways in M1 and M2c macrophages without altering cytokine secretion, decreased a specific subtype of M1 macrophages and CXCL4-induced M2-like macrophages, and improved mitochondrial health by enhancing mitochondrial recycling via mitophagy. Similar treatment of the in vivo model organism C. elegans induced mitophagy and extended lifespan, suggesting evolutionary conservation of mechanism. Our work demonstrates that a drug that remodels mitochondria and metabolism can shape the immune cell repertoire, which could aid the development of more effective antimicrobials and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.">

        <tr id="T cell responses are vital for controlling viral infection in the central nervous system (CNS), but must be tightly regulated to limit tissue-damaging inflammation. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) CNS infection, an in vivo model for JCPyV-induced Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), we investigated sites of early infection, immune responses, and recruitment of T cells to the brain. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) single-cell spatial transcriptomics was applied to assess the regionality of virus infection and brain-resident cell and infiltrating leukocyte responses. MERFISH, immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry demonstrate that the ependyma is the predominant region of MuPyV CNS infection and localization of T cells, and implicated CXCR4 and CXCR6 in T cell migration to the ependyma and subventricular zone. Using CXCR6 knockout mice and a specific CXCR4 small molecule antagonist, we found that the combined impairment of CXCR6 and CXCR4 signaling resulted in elevated infiltration of T cells in the MuPyV-infected brain. This work demonstrates that CXCR4 and CXCR6 act in a nonredundant fashion to restrict T cell accumulation to the polyomavirus-infected ependyma, with important implications for ongoing efforts to use JCPyV-specific T cell adoptive immunotherapy for PML.

        <tr id="Innate immune cells appear to have an important implication in the resolution and/or the aggravation of the COVID-19 pathogenesis after infection with SARS-CoV-2. To better appreciate the role of these cells during COVID-19, changes in blood eosinophil, the neutrophil and monocyte count, and levels of surface protein markers have been reported. However, analyses at several timepoints of multiple surface markers on granulocytes and monocytes over a period of one month after a SARS-CoV-2 infection are missing. Therefore, in this study, we performed blood eosinophil, neutrophil, and monocyte phenotyping using a list of surface proteins and flow cytometry during a period of 30 days after the hospitalization of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Blood cell counts were reported at seven different timepoints over the 30-day period as well as measures of multiple mediators in serum using a targeted multiplex assay approach. Our results indicate a 95% drop in the blood eosinophil count by D1, with eosinophils displaying a phenotype defined as CD69/CD63/CD125high and CCR3/CD44low during the early phases of hospitalization. Conversely, by D7 the neutrophil count increased significantly and displayed an immature, activated, and immunosuppressive phenotype (i.e., 3% of CD10/CD16low and CD10lowCD177high, 6.7% of CD11bhighCD62Llow, and 1.6% of CD16highCD62Llow), corroborated by enhanced serum proteins that are markers of neutrophil activation. Finally, our results suggest a rapid recruitment of non-classical monocytes leaving CD163/CD64high and CD32low monocytes in circulation during the very early phase. In conclusion, our study reveals potential very early roles for eosinophils and monocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with a likely reprogramming of eosinophils in the bone marrow. The exact roles of the pro-inflammatory neutrophils and the functions of the eosinophils and the monocytes, as well as these innate immune cell types, interplays need to be further investigated.">

The mechanisms by which aging negatively impacts the innate and adaptive immune system, leading to enhanced susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens, remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we utilized a mouse model of infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a virus that can infect the lungs and lead to pneumonia, a rare but serious health concern in the elderly. Following intranasal inoculation of young (6 weeks), adult (36 weeks), and aged mice (68 weeks) with HSV-1 (KOS strain) we: (i) compared the local and systemic immune responses to infection in young, adult, and aged mice, and (ii) correlated the level and type of immune responses to protection against HSV-1 infection and disease. Compared to young and adult mice, aged mice displayed: (i) increased activation of epithelial cells with a decreased expression of TLR3; (ii) increased activation of dendritic cells with increased expression of MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD80/86; (iii) decreased production of type-I interferons; (iv) delayed production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs; and (v) impairment frequencies of functional HSV-specific CD107+IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells associated with the increased incidence of viral infection and disease.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major health emergency since its emergence in late 2019. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of COVID-19, leading to severe illness, i.e. coagulopathy, multi-organ failure. FX06, a fibrin-derived peptide naturally occurring in the human body, formerly known as Bβ15-42, is a promising therapeutic candidate for endothelial complications like capillary leakage in COVID-19 and other forms of acute respiratory disorders. The aim of this project is to investigate whether FX06 can attenuate COVID-19 cytokine-triggered inflammatory processes in vitro. Methods To mimic the inflammatory status of COVID-19, a human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (ECs) – HULEC-5a, was treated with a cytokine cocktail comprised of ten different cytokines or chemokines at concentrations found in serum profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness, further referred to as the severe cytokine cocktail. ECs were treated with the severe cytokine cocktail for 24 h, in the absence or presence of FX06 for 2 h. Results The severe cytokine cocktail enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-endothelial adhesion and monolayer transmigration. This deleterious effect was significantly reduced by FX06. FX06 was also shown to mitigate the cytotoxic activity of allogeneic CD8+ T cells, which increased upon cytokine treatment. FX06 restored continuous vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/CD144 distribution on the EC surface and reversed morphological changes mediated by the severe cytokine cocktail, such as the elongation of F-actin stress fibers. FX06 reduced capillary-like structure formation of the severe cytokine cocktail treated-ECs, indicating FX06 down-regulated the pro-inflammatory angiogenic activity caused by the severe cytokine cocktail. Additionally, FX06 might assist in maintaining the normal barrier function of ECs by altering the surface expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses demonstrated that FX06 in the presence of the severe cytokine cocktail inactivated RhoGTPase, which was confirmed by western blotting that FX06 attenuated RhoA, a member of RhoGTPase, enhanced by the severe cytokine cocktail and down-regulated the expression of the phosphorylated downstream protein, ROCK1. Conclusion Overall, FX06 shows promising potential in normalizing ECs and reducing vascular leakage to protect the endothelium against the proinflammatory effect of COVID-19-triggered cytokines.">

        <tr id="The C. elegans-Orsay virus pathosystem provides a powerful model for investigating the mechanisms that govern viral infection and immunity. Here, we focus on two key aspects of this interaction: the impact of lifelong latent infections and the dynamics of superinfection. By tracking the course of a lifelong infection, we demonstrate that the infection remains latent, with animals maintaining control over viral replication for most of their lifespan. Furthermore, we show that animals previously exposed to the virus can suppress viral replication following a second inoculation, indicative of an acquired immune response. Primary infections led to changes in transcriptomic and small RNA profiles, which varied depending on the developmental stage of the host and the timing of analysis. In contrast, superinfection disrupted multiple sRNA classes. Over time, the ability to control repeated viral reactivations declined, whereas resistance to superinfection was stable, ultimately favoring the primary infecting virus. This phenomenon was dependent on a functional RNA interference pathway.">

        <tr id="Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) promote lung protection and pathogen eradication during acute lung injury. We, therefore, tested the theory that pharmacologic stabilization of HIFs dampens lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Initial studies in murine SARS-CoV-2 models showed improved outcomes after treatment with the FDA-approved HIF stabilizer vadadustat. Subsequent studies in genetic models implicated alveolus-expressed Hif1a in mediating lung protection. Therefore, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase II trial in patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection and concomitant hypoxia (SpO2 ≤ 94%). Patients (n = 448) were randomized to oral vadadustat (900 mg/day) or placebo for up to 14 days. Safety events were similar between the 2 groups. Vadadustat treatment induced surrogate HIF target genes. The primary outcome of severe lung injury requiring high oxygen support on day 14 occurred in 43 patients in the vadadustat group and 53 patients in the placebo group (estimated probability, 13.3% vs. 16.9%). Among patients with baseline fraction of inspired oxygen of 80% or higher (n = 106), the estimated probability of the primary outcome was 12.1% (vadadustat) versus 79.1% (placebo), indicating an even greater benefit in patients with more severe baseline hypoxia. HIF1A is a likely therapeutic target during SARS-CoV-2–associated lung injury. Robust clinical trials of HIF stabilizers during pathogen-associated lung injury are warranted.">

        <tr id="Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

        <tr id="Background: Circulating degranulated platelets have been described during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated with COVID-19 complications. This study investigated the relationship between the presence of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ie, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia), systemic inflammation, and platelet dysfunction in a group of patients with COVID-19. Unlike our previous publication, which focused on platelet characterization, this work explores potential determinants of platelet activation, based on a distinct subset of patients with available stored samples. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 were stratified by platelet δ-granule content using the luciferin/luciferase assay into 2 groups: normal (COVδ-norm) and low (COVδ-low). Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (RT-qPCR), cytokines, and chemokines (Cytometric Bead Array) were quantified on plasma samples. Markers of platelet activation were measured by flow cytometry in whole blood. Results: A total of 75 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled; 57 presented normal levels of platelet δ-granule content (COVδ-norm) and 18 had low levels of platelet δ-granules (COVδ-low). Groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia levels. Patients in the COVδ-low group showed significantly higher chemokine and cytokine levels compared to those in the COVδ-norm group, with strong correlations between IL-6, as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with platelet degranulation parameters. A similar trend, albeit less pronounced, was observed when patients were stratified based on their platelet activation phenotype. Conclusions: These findings suggest that peripheral inflammation, rather than SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, is associated with platelet dysfunction during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms by which Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) infection leads to acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a severe neurological condition characterized by sudden muscle weakness and paralysis, remain poorly understood. To investigate the cellular tropism and infection dynamics of EV-D68, we profiled naive and EV-D68-infected human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs). Upon infection with two EV-D68 strains, US/IL/14-18952 (a B2 strain) and US/MA/18-23089 (a B3 strain), we observed distinct viral tropism and host transcriptional responses. Notably, US/IL/14-18952 showed a significant preference for neurons, while US/MA/18-23089 exhibited higher rates of infection in cycling astrocytes and OPCs. These findings provide novel insights into the host cell tropism of EV-D68 in the spinal cord, offering insight into the potential mechanisms underlying AFM pathogenesis. Understanding the dynamics of infection at single-cell resolution will inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the neurological impact of enteroviral infections.">

Using single-cell technology, we analyzed infected pig spleens and found macrophages—a type of immune cell—to be the virus’s primary target. Infection depletes disease-fighting cells while favoring virus-supportive conditions. We identified four macrophage subtypes, including one highly susceptible to infection and another with antiviral properties that is rapidly destroyed. The viral E165R gene was essential for ASFV replication while disrupting host defense signals. By tracking cellular changes, we revealed how macrophages drive ASFV progression. Our findings offer insights for future therapies against this global threat.">

        <tr id="Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers a dynamic immune response involving macrophages, However, the functional heterogeneity of these cells and the mechanisms through which they promote repair remain unclear. Although the neuropeptide CGRP has been shown to modulate macrophage phenotypes in other pathological contexts, its role in ICH recovery and white matter repair remains unexplored. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45 + cells from ICH mice (GSE167593 and GSE230414 datasets) identified macrophage subsets. Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

        <tr id="Background Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant threat to human health. The virus causes potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS), for which no treatments are available. TBEV infected individuals display a wide spectrum of neuronal disease, the determinants of which are undefined. Changes to host metabolism and virus-induced immunity have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal damage observed in infected individuals. In this study, we evaluated the cytokine, chemokine, and metabolic alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic patients infected with TBEV presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. Our aim was to investigate the host immune and metabolic responses associated with specific TBEV infectious outcomes. Methods CSF samples of patients with meningitis (n = 27) or encephalitis (n = 25) were obtained upon consent from individuals hospitalised with confirmed TBEV infection in Brno. CSF from uninfected control patients was also collected for comparison (n = 12). A multiplex bead-based system was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Untargeted metabolomics followed by bioinformatics and integrative omics were used to profile the levels of metabolites in the CSF. Human motor neurons (hMNs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV-Hypr strain to profile the role(s) of identified metabolites during the virus lifecycle. Virus infection was quantified via plaque assay. Results Significant differences in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-α2, TSLP, IL-1α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-15, and IL-18) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL20, and CXCL11) were detected between neurological-TBEV and control patients. A total of 32 CSF metabolites differed in TBE patients with meningitis and encephalitis. CSF S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP1) and Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) levels were 2.4-fold (range ≥ 2.3-≥3.2) higher in encephalitis patients compared to the meningitis group. CSF urocanic acid levels were significantly lower in patients with encephalitis compared to those with meningitis (p = 0.012209). Follow-up analyses showed fluctuations in the levels of O-phosphoethanolamine, succinic acid, and L-proline in the encephalitis group, and pyruvic acid in the meningitis group. TBEV-infection of hMNs increased the production of SAM, FBP1 and PEP in a time-dependent manner. Depletion of the metabolites with characterised pharmacological inhibitors led to a concentration-dependent attenuation of virus growth, validating the identified changes as key mediators of TBEV infection. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the neurological disease outcome of TBEV infection is associated with specific and dynamic metabolic signatures in the cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a new in vitro model for in-depth studies of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis, in which the depletion of identified metabolites limits virus infection. Collectively, this reveals new biomarkers that can differentiate and predict TBEV-associated neurological disease. Additionally, we have identified novel therapeutic targets with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of TBEV pathogenesis.

        <tr id="While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from diverse cell types and organs are also susceptible to infection. Using the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) approach, we systematically targeted human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2, thus identifying unrecognized host factors that may facilitate viral entry. Validation experiments with replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 confirmed the role of newly identified host factors, particularly the endo-lysosomal protease legumain (LGMN) and the potassium channel KCNA6, upon exogenous overexpression. In orthogonal experiments, we show that disruption of endogenous LGMN or KCNA6 decreases viral infection and that inhibitors of candidate factors can reduce viral entry. Additionally, using clinical data, we find possible associations between expression of either LGMN or KCNA6 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in human tissues. Our results identify potentially druggable host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, and demonstrate the utility of focused, membrane-wide CRISPRa screens in uncovering tissue-specific entry factors of emerging pathogens.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="Background Myeloid cells, such as resident microglia (MG), infiltrating monocytes (Mo), macrophages (MΦ), and CNS border-associated macrophages (BAM) in the brain, participate in aged brain injury. Aged microglial replacement is protective against brain injury in aged mice; however, whether/how the molecular changes in myeloid cells are affected by this replacement in injured brains remains unclear. Methods Aged microglia in mice were eliminated by PLX3397 for 21 consecutive days and repopulated following withdrawal for 21 days; then, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) models were constructed. Then, a single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of acutely injured brains in aged mice with microglial replacement was performed. Results We observed similarities but strong divergence in the composition and molecular change features of myeloid cells between the replacement (Rep) and control (Con) groups, indicating retention of the core transcriptome and development of differential genes in myeloid cells after microglial replacement in response to brain injury. Both MG and Mo/MΦ experience modification of immune responses after microglial repopulation, with more prominent changes in MG. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that one term directly related to the “immune response” was shared between upregulated genes in Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, while the other terms related to immune functions and other biofunctions were different between Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, indicative of significantly different immune responses to brain injury between MG and MΦ. Furthermore, the trajectory analysis showed a significant transition from aged to young state in Rep-MG compared to only a modest youthful shift in Rep-Mo/MΦ, suggesting a rejuvenation process of aged microglia and macrophages toward young ones in response to brain injury after the treatment of microglial replacement. Conclusion Our data indicate that microglial replacement-induced changes in the molecular heterogeneity and state transition of myeloid cells may be neuroprotective against acute brain injury.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the world with a major public health problem, long COVID (LC), which is estimated to affect over 400 million people worldwide. Many unknowns remain regarding the mechanisms involved in LC. We investigated the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and IFN-γ responses on the development of LC and its various phenotypes. We studied a cohort of 137 convalescents following predominantly mild COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave (2020) and up to one-year post-infection. We found 45% of LC cases that were associated with a greater number and duration of acute-phase symptoms. Cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal symptoms in the acute phase were associated to protection against LC development, while pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, musculoskeletal and other symptoms were associated with increased risk of LC development. Regarding LC phenotypes, we observed risk associations and potentially deleterious effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for LC symptoms classified as general or other. In contrast, for vital organ-related LC symptoms, we found only protective associations, particularly for cardiovascular symptoms, which indeed had a low prevalence in LC (16%). Collectively, our data suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies play a protective role against vital organ-related LC symptoms, especially cardiovascular symptoms, but are insufficient in preventing or limiting other highly prevalent LC symptoms, such as neurological, psychiatric and pulmonary.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced excessive inflammatory response is a key contributor to pathology in respiratory viral infections. However, the underlying mechanisms by which viral infection provokes intense inflammatory reaction and how sustained inflammation leads to tissue damage are not fully understood. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as an example, our research demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce PANoptosis in bystander cells, contributing to the persistence of inflammatory responses. Specifically, the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in infected cells leads to the secretion of 2'3'cGMP-AMP, TNF-α, and IFN-β. These molecules activate STING-induced autophagy-mediated ADAR1 degradation, resulting in the accumulation of Z-nucleic acid, which subsequently triggers ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis in bystander cells. Additionally, inhibiting the cGAS pathway or knocking out STING effectively reduces PANoptosis and alleviates the pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus infection in mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal the unexpected role of PANoptosis in bystander cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection as a mechanism driving pathological damage and persistent inflammatory responses. Targeting this process may offer a promising strategy to mitigate tissue damage in COVID-19 as well as other viral infections and inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Aims Macrophage-mediated inflammatory response plays a pivotal role in the pathological process of myocardial infarction (MI). Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) shed light on the differentiation and function of macrophage subsets post-MI, it failed to capture protein-level changes, limiting comprehensive assessment. Methods To address this limitation, first, we analyzed the scRNA-seq data from ArrayExpress, after comprehensive quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and clustering analyses, macrophage subsets were systematically classified and annotated using established computational pipelines. Then, these computational classifications were validated through rigorous animal experiments. Finally, we integrated proteomic data from our experimental model and scRNA-seq to analyze the effect of protein modification changes in macrophage subsets on prognosis post-MI. Results A total of seven macrophage clusters were identified and annotated, including Spp1hiMac, MHCIIhiMac, Ltc4shiMac, Lyve1hiMac, DcnhiMac, Ly6c1hiMono and Stmn1hiMac. Spp1hiMac and Ltc4shiMac, linked to leukocyte migration and chemotaxis, peaked at 3 days. MHCIIhiMac and and DcnhiMac, involved in antigen processing and presentation and collagen fibril organization, peaked at 7 days. Lyve1hiMac reduced on days 3 and 7, and by day 28 returned to baseline levels. By integrating scRNA-seq and proteomics, there 78, 126, and 64 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in macrophages were obtained at 3, 7 and 28 days, respectively. At 3 days, DEPs were linked to inflammation, protein processing and maturation. At 7 days, DEPs were enriched in regulation of actin filament organization and cellular response to interferon-gamma. At 28 days, DEPs exhibited inhibitory effects on inflammation, cell apoptosis and migration. The post-translational modifications (PTMs) of DEPs involved phosphorylation, acetylation and lactylation, and these DEPs are mainly associated with inflammation, fibrosis and cytoskeletal organization, including Marcks, Anxa2, Vim, Dcn, Tpm3 and so on. Conclusion By integrating scRNAseq and proteomics data, this study provides a comprehensive overview of heterogeneity and dynamic protein level changes of macrophages post-MI, and characterizes the PTMs in macrophages, and lays the groundwork for developing targeted interventions tailored to specific cell types and time points post-MI.

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes are central mediators of neuroinflammation in several neurodegenerative diseases. Their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. This study aimed to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes were cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a microfluidic coculture platform. This platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of distinct microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 h. Glial activation and interactions were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. LPS stimulation of cocultures induced lower secretion of several inflammatory mediators, suggesting dampening of microglial inflammatory responses when cocultured with astrocytes. Notably, inflammatory interaction between glial cells was demonstrated by increased level of IL-10 after TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation in cocultures compared with monocultures. The microfluidic coculture platform enabled the parallel study of microglial migration, glial activation and phagocytic function, thereby facilitating the investigation of glial responses within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Furthermore, glial inflammatory responses and interactions were demonstrated in the controlled microenvironments of the microfluidic coculture platform. The inflammatory coculture environment was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate inflammatory interaction between iPSC-derived microglia and astrocytes via reciprocal molecular signaling. Importantly, the microfluidic coculture platform established in this study provides a more functional and advanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.

        <tr id="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), stands as one of the most severe pandemics the world has ever faced in recent times. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of symptoms, varying from severe manifestations to mild cases and even asymptomatic carriers. This diversity stems from a multitude of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral variants, and immune status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system engages pattern recognition receptors, setting off a series of intricate signalling cascades. These cascades culminate in the activation of innate immune responses, including induction of type I and type III interferons. The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose challenges to the innate immune system defense. Therefore, investigating the innate immune response is crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophoshate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, a critical innate immune mechanism, represents a promising target for intervention at multiple stages to reduce the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other immune responses critical for SARS-CoV-2 defence. As part of the therapeutic approach, we extend our review to highlight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as emerging and effective therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 by targeting different stages of the innate immune system. A diverse range of mAbs has been explored to address specific targets within the innate immune pathways. A deep understanding of innate immunity and targeted monoclonal therapeutics will be instrumental in combating viruses and their variants, laying the foundation for enhanced treatment and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Multi-specific and long-lasting T-cell immunity has been recognized to indicate long-term protection against pathogens, including the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Functional significance of peripheral memory T cells in individuals recovered from COVID-19 (COVID-19+) is beginning to be appreciated; however, the role of lung tissue-resident memory (lung TRM) T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still being investigated. This is, in part, due to the lack of preclinical tissue models available to follow the convalescence period. Methods Here, we utilize a perfused three-dimensional (3D) human lung-tissue model and show pre-existing local T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins in lung tissues. Results We report ex vivo maintenance of functional multi-specific IFN-γ-secreting lung TRM T cells in COVID-19+ and their induction in lung tissues of vaccinated COVID-19+ subjects. Importantly, we identify SARS-CoV-2 peptide-responding memory B cells and IgA+ plasma cells in ex vivo cultured lung tissues of COVID-19+. Furthermore, lung tissue IgA levels were increased in COVID-19+ and responded to peptide stimulation. Discussion In our study, we highlight the importance of utilization of human lung-tissue models to understand the local antiviral immune response in the lung to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="In the last 2 years, there has been an increasing concern that SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a marker of undiagnosed cancers. A potential connection between COVID-19/long COVID and malignant transformation/cancer progression was reported in a number of studies. It is, however, unclear if the virus itself can cause malignant transformation or if it has a potential to support malignant processes in human body. We analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs collected from individuals infected with Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and conducted in vitro studies using BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells. Here we report that Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein induce activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex in infected cells. This effect is achieved through conversion of cellular 2-oxoglutarate into 2-hydroxy-glutarate, which most likely blocks the activity of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation. As such, it leads to activation of HIF-1, which triggers production of transforming growth factor–β type 1 (TGF-β). TGF-β induces expression of immune checkpoint proteins, such as galectin-9, programmed death-ligand 1, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme, which is involved in production of immunosuppressive amino acid called L-kynurenine. These immune checkpoint pathways were capable of suppressing both helper and cytotoxic activities of T lymphocytes and, as such, could potentially support malignant processes in infected tissues.">

This retrospective study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of viral antigen and associated pathological changes in the nose, lungs, brain, and eyes of K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2. Using histology and immunohistochemistry, tissues were examined at 3, 6, and 7/8 days post-infection (dpi). In addition, lung and brain tissues were analyzed by means of RT-qPCR to determine viral RNA titers. Viral antigen was most pronounced in the nose, brain, and lung at 3, 6, and 7/8 dpi, respectively, whereas viral antigen was detected at 6 and 7/8 dpi in the retina. Quantitative PCR confirmed increasing viral RNA levels in both lung and brain, peaking at 7/8 dpi. Nasal and lung inflammation mirrored viral antigen distribution and localization. In the brain, the predominantly basal viral spread correlated with lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis, neuronal vacuolation, and altered neurofilament immunoreactivity. Retinal ganglion cells showed viral antigen expression without associated lesions. Microglial activation was evident in both the optic chiasm and the brain. These findings highlight the K18-hACE2 model’s utility for studying extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of viral spread enhances insights into SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its clinical manifestations.">

        <tr id="Background In late 2022, Beijing, China saw a large-scale BF.7 Omicron variant breakthrough infection. However, the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on elderly breakthrough-infected patients’ antibodies and immune cells response was unclear. Methods We recruited 329 inpatients over 65 with BF.7 breakthrough infections. We analyzed the link between vaccination and survival in 67 sampled patients, investigating changes in antibody levels, cytokine profiles, as well as immune phenotypes. Results Experiments revealed that while vaccination could raise antibody levels in the elderly, it showed no significant neutralizing activity against the emerging COVID-19 variant XBB. Flow cytometry showed vaccination increased the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Moreover, we found that elevated frequencies of CD4+ Tsens cells were associated with reduced antigen-specific CD4+ T cell activation, diminished IL-2 production, and lower proportions of Tfh cells, which ultimately leading to impaired neutralizing antibody production, particularly against new emerging variants. Conclusions We found the immunological efficacy of inactivated vaccines in elderly patients is influenced by the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Future elderly vaccination strategies need optimization in dose number and timing, and future vaccine design should aim to minimize the generation of CD4+ senescent T cells.

        <tr id="Severe viral infections can precipitate acute lung injury, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. While NETosis serves as an important defense mechanism against pathogens and viruses, its excessive or dysregulated activation may contribute to pulmonary damage. In this study, elevated levels of NETosis were detected in the peripheral blood of patients with viral pneumonia. To further investigate the relationship between NETosis and virus-induced acute lung injury, a murine model was established using intratracheal administration of poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA that mimics viral infection. NETosis biomarkers were assessed in both patients and poly(I:C)-stimulated mice. In addition, we examined the role of the Hippo signaling pathway and its downstream mediators, including inflammatory factors and chemokines. Enhanced NETosis and activation of the Hippo pathway were observed in the lungs of poly(I:C)-treated mice, along with elevated levels of IL-1β in isolated macrophages. These effects were mitigated by Hippo pathway inhibitors. Co-culture experiments confirmed that IL-1β promotes NETosis, while NLRP3, acting downstream of the Hippo pathway, was responsible for IL-1β secretion. Patients with viral pneumonia showed increased NLRP3 and IL-1β expression in monocyte-derived macrophages compared to healthy controls. Overall, our findings indicate that activation of the Hippo pathway in macrophages during poly(I:C) exposure upregulates NLRP3 and IL-1β expression, thereby promoting NETosis and exacerbating virus-induced lung injury. This study highlights a potential therapeutic target to reduce lung damage caused by viral infections.">

        <tr id="Different functional T lymphocytes play important roles in the progression of IAV infection, including proliferation, recruitment, and effector activity. However, the immune changes of T cells during IAV infection are unclear, and the related targets are still to be explored. In this study, we used a multi-omics approach combining transcriptome and single-cell transcriptome analysis to identify TXN as a key target gene and elucidate its close association with T-cell proliferation. From these data, we identified 10 key differential genes through a combination of differential analysis, WGCNA, and Friends analysis and further identified that only TXN and S100A6 co-existed in the highly variable genes of proliferative T cells. Because TXN exhibits highly specific high expression in proliferative T cells, we focused on its related research and ultimately identified it as a target gene for IAV infection. Reports have suggested that simultaneous inhibition of the GSH and TXN pathways can effectively trigger cell death. This proves our hypothesis about a new direction of T cell death in IAV infection. Additionally, we found that T cell development after IAV infection was regulated and altered, but this study did not clearly explain whether it was negative regulation. In summary, we have identified TXN as a target gene involved in T cell proliferation during IAV infection, and we suggest that its expression may be associated with non-apoptotic forms of T cell death.

        <tr id="The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection varies greatly, with many patients requiring intensive care due to complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome, reduced respiratory system compliance, and altered iron metabolism, which can be mistaken for worsening Influenza A infection. This highlights the need to study the humoral immune response to better understand the pathophysiology of viral respiratory infections and improve treatments and diagnostics. This study analyzed autoantibody and acute-phase reactant profiles in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A using customized protein microarrays for sensitive and reproducible results. The findings revealed a significant increase in autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients, including those targeting calcitonin-related polypeptides, hepatocyte growth factor, or interleukin 8, compared to Influenza A patients, who showed elevated levels of selectin E and surfactant protein D. Additionally, most acute-phase reactants were higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The serological profile showed that the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain induced both IgM and IgG responses to all viral proteins, while other strains triggered an IgG response only at a later stage. Multiomics factor analysis identified key factors driving variation in COVID-19's heterogeneous disease presentation. These insights offer valuable information for developing vaccines and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.">

This study systematically characterized immune responses in SARS-CoV-2-challenged hMHC mice lung tissues through comparative transcriptomic profiling, combined with functional enrichment and PPI network analyses.Key findings demonstrate that hMHC mice exhibit enhanced immunological activation relative to wild-type controls, particularly in IFN-γ signaling pathways and neutrophil mobilization dynamics that closely parallel human post-vaccination responses. Comparative analysis with human whole blood RNA-seq datasets revealed that hMHC mice exhibit both high reproducibility in transcriptomic profiles and significant similarity to human immune responses across innate and adaptive immunity. These results confirm that the hMHC murine model can serve as an effective platform for vaccine research, providing a theoretical foundation for the application of humanized MHC mice and offering new insights into viral infection mechanisms and the development of novel vaccines.">

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is not only a key structural protein but also instrumental in mediating the host immune response, contributing significantly to inflammation and viral pathogenesis. Due to its immunogenic properties, SARS-CoV-2 N protein also interacts with host factors associated with various pre-existing inflammatory conditions and may possibly contribute to the long-term symptoms suffered by some COVID-19 patients after recovery—known as long COVID. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in elucidating the biological functions of the N protein.

        <tr id="Chronic migraine (CM) is a debilitating neurological disorder, yet the glial-specific mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC)—a critical hub for craniofacial pain processing—remain poorly understood. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to resolve cell-type-specific transcriptional landscapes in a nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced CM rat model, with a particular focus on microglia and astrocytes. We identified 19 transcriptional clusters representing nine major cell types, among which reactive microglia (NTG-Mic) and astrocytes (NTG-Asts) were markedly expanded. The NTG-Mic displayed a glycolysis-dominant, complement-enriched state, whereas the NTG-Asts exhibited concurrent activation of amino acid transport and cytokine signaling pathways. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed bifurcated glial activation paths, with NTG driving both cell types toward terminal reactive states. Intercellular communication inference uncovered suppressed homeostatic interactions (e.g., CSF1-CSF1R) alongside enhanced proinflammatory signaling (e.g., FGF1-FGFR2, PTN-SDC4), particularly affecting neuron–glia and glia–glia crosstalk. Together, these findings define a high-resolution atlas of glial reprogramming in CM, implicating state-specific metabolic–immune transitions and dysregulated glial communication as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Objectives: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019. It is unclear whether anti-viral cellular and humoral immunity is impacted in patients with ILD in the presence of immune disorders and immunosuppressive therapy. This results in poor control of viral infections following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to highlight the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We compared viral clearance, antibody levels, and T-cell immune response between healthy controls and patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Results: Patients with ILD exhibited a higher viral load than the control group (1.58 × 106 vs. 2.37 × 103 copies/mL, p = 0.018), as well as a significantly lower level of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (WT) virus (7.01 vs. 625.6, p < 0.0001) and Omicron BA.5 (7.19 vs. 128.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, a lower virus-specific T-cell (VST) immune response was observed 14 days post-symptom onset in the ILD group (CD4+ VSTs: 0.018 vs. 0.082, p = 0.005; CD8+ VSTs: 0.0008 vs. 0.047, p = 0.004). The ILD group had no other heightened inflammatory biomarkers compared with the control group. Conclusions: Our study provides novel evidence of the underlying interaction between virus clearance and host immune status and sheds light on the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous virus with a global prevalence of 90%, but infection typically has minimal clinical impact in immunocompetent individuals. Consequently, most people are neither tested nor treated for HCMV. However, HCMV seropositivity is associated with higher hospitalization rates following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to seronegative individuals, suggesting that viral reactivation may exacerbate severity of clinical symptoms. To investigate this, rhesus macaques naturally infected with rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and monitored. Following inoculation, RhCMV viral loads in plasma increased from baseline, indicating reactivation. Within tissues, the lungs and ileum expressed immediate early protein-1 (IE1), a marker of active RhCMV infection. Additionally, elevated frequencies of circulating activated CD69+ memory T cells at day 3 suggested a recall response to a previously encountered pathogen. These findings demonstrate RhCMV reactivation and associated immune activation following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the rhesus macaque/RhCMV model as a valuable tool to elucidate the role of HCMV in SARS-CoV2 disease in immunocompetent hosts.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological alterations, ranging from headache and dizziness to severe encephalopathy and inflammatory neurological diseases (IND), and neuropathological findings suggest immune-mediated processes. Therefore, we sought to characterize profiles of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and markers of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis in COVID-19 patients with neurological alterations to identify key factors and mechanisms underlying CNS disturbances in COVID-19. The study included a case series of 52 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations, which were categorized into three groups: isolated refractory headache (n = 14), encephalopathy (n = 24), and IND (n = 14). Individuals with non-inflammatory, non-infectious neurological conditions (n = 9) were included as negative controls. Paired CSF and serum samples were assessed for 56 biomarkers. Regardless of the neurological condition, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated CSF levels of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, IL-25, IFN-α2, CCL7, CCL11, and GM-CSF. Patients with encephalopathy and IND also showed increased IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, neopterin, IL-7, CXCL8, CXCL9, TGF-α, EGF, sTREM-2, and HMGB1, consistent with a CNS cytokine storm. In contrast, individuals with isolated refractory headache showed a modest inflammatory profile, compatible with the limited CNS involvement. COVID-19 patients showed elevated serum IL-13, IL-18, TNF-α, VILIP-1, TGF-α, and VEGF levels, indicating systemic inflammation and potential blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. β-NGF was increased in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, suggesting the activation of neuroprotective responses during patient recovery. Functional protein network analysis showed a significant enrichment of interactions between factors altered in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, many of them related to processes of neuroinflammation and microglial functions, and leukocyte chemotaxis, activation and proliferation. These findings support a model in which both systemic immune activation and localized neuroinflammation contribute to the diversity of neurological outcomes observed in COVID-19, and dysregulated cytokine production, glial activation, inflammasome activity and BBB disturbances represent key factors in neuro-COVID-19 pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the world in 2025. The rapid mutation of SARS-CoV-2 results in breakthrough infections and diminishes the efficacy of vaccines and anti-viral drugs. The severity of the disease varies across different variants, and the underlying mechanisms driving these differences remain unclear. This study explores the relationship between different Spike variants and cytotoxicity, aiming to determine whether the humanized decoy receptor ACE2-Fc can neutralize spikes from diverse variants, offering a solution to overcome rapid mutating SARS-CoV-2 induced immune escape. Methods We co-cultured 293 T-ACE2 cells with 293 T cells transfected with various Spike protein variants or used H1650-ACE2 cells transfected with these Spike variants. This allowed us to observe the effects of different Spike mutations, specifically focusing on cell fusion, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry is employed to determine if ACE2-Fc can recognize different Spike variants. We also assess the ability of ACE2-Fc to inhibit infection, cell fusion, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release through pseudovirus infections or Spike protein transfections. Additionally, we use actual viruses from SARS-CoV-2 patients to validate the impacts of Spike mutations and the effectiveness of ACE2-Fc. Furthermore, human plasma is utilized to evaluate ACE2-Fc’s capability to inhibit Spike-induced clot formation. Results We found that different Spike variants, particularly those with enhancements at the S2' site, increased cell–cell fusion capability, which correlated positively with cytotoxicity and cytokine IL-6 and TNF-α released from PBMCs. ACE2-Fc recognized spikes from wide-range of variants, including wild type, Alpha, Delta, Delta plus, Lambda, BA.2, BA.2.75, BA.5, BF.7, BQ.1, XBB.1, JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3, and effectively prevented these spike-expressing pseudo-viruses from entering host cells. Crucially, ACE2-Fc can prevent spike-induced cell fusion, thereby reducing subsequent cytotoxicity and the release of IL-6 and TNF-α from PBMCs. ACE2-Fc also effectively reduces plasma clot formation induced by trimeric spike proteins. Conclusions These findings demonstrated that ACE2-Fc could effectively combat the infection of rapidly mutating SARS-CoV-2, providing a potential solution to overcome immune evasion.

        <tr id="In 2022, consecutive sweeps of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-derived lineages (B.1.1.529*) maintained viral transmission despite extensive antigen exposure from both vaccinations and infections. To better understand Omicron variant emergence in the context of the dynamic fitness landscape of 2022, we aimed to explore putative drivers behind SARS-CoV-2 lineage replacements. Variant fitness is determined through its ability to either outrun previously dominant lineages or more efficiently circumvent host immune responses to previous infections and vaccinations. By analyzing data collected through our local genomic surveillance program from Connecticut, USA, we compared emerging Omicron lineages’ growth rates, estimated infections, effective reproductive rates, average viral copy numbers, and likelihood for causing infections in recently vaccinated individuals. We find that newly emerging Omicron lineages outcompeted dominant lineages through a combination of enhanced viral shedding or advanced immune escape depending on the population-level exposure state. This analysis integrates individual-level sequencing data with demographic, vaccination, laboratory, and epidemiological data and provides further insights into host–pathogen dynamics beyond public aggregate data.">

        <tr id="Microglia play a fundamental role in maintaining central nervous system homeostasis by monitoring brain tissue for physical, structural, and biochemical alterations. Its involvement in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders is well documented. However, the role of microglia in cerebral malaria, a disease associated with high mortality and long-term neurological sequelae, remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized the classical model of experimental cerebral malaria (Plasmodium berghei ANKA-infected C57BL/6 mice) to investigate the dynamics and response of resident brain cell populations, particularly microglia, and the influx of other leukocytes during the development of experimental cerebral malaria. By employing flow cytometry and established markers for different leukocyte populations, we were able to discern and document an increase in the number of Ly6C+ T cells (CD45hiCD11b-CD3+ cells), inflammatory monocytes (CD45hiCD11b+TMEM119-CD206- cells), resident macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+TMEM119-CD206+ cells), and microglia (CD45lowCD11b+ TMEM119+CD206- cells) following infection. Moreover, our ex vivo analysis demonstrated an increment in the overall number of inflammatory monocytes, resident macrophages and microglia expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in addition to those producing interleukin-1β or TNF. These findings highlight the pronounced reactivity of microglia in experimental cerebral malaria and provide valuable information on cell dynamics and immune responses in the brain.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a critical global health threat, with DENV-2 being the most virulent serotype capable of causing lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a severe complication characterized by plasma leakage and hemorrhagic manifestations. While the search for viral receptors and immunocompetent animal models has persisted since the first recorded outbreak in 1779, significant gaps remain. Here, we establish the first immunocompetent murine model of DHF with intact innate/adaptive immunity by generating hTim4-transgenic C57BL/6J mice. This model recapitulates fatal DHF complications seen in humans, including systemic hemorrhage, dengue encephalitis and intestinal ischemia/gangrene. Integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analysis of hemorrhagic gut lesions demonstrated that DENV-2 infection induces Syk protein overexpression, leading to enhanced Th2 cytokine secretion and impaired hemostatic regulation. This cascade enhances vascular permeability, promotes plasma leakage, and drives multiorgan hemorrhage, a mechanism corroborated by parallel analyses of human DHF tissues. Critically, Th2-biased cytokine storm mirrors clinical findings in severe human dengue cases. Our work not only identifies hTim4 as a functional DENV-2 receptor but also provides a mechanistically grounded platform for DHF pathogenesis studies, bridging critical gaps between preclinical models and human immunopathology.">

NK cell activity, including cytokine secretion, cytotoxic activity, and the coordination of inhibitory and activating receptors, linking innate and adaptive immunity, among others, has been examined for numerous pathogens, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 health crisis has exposed a deficiency in understanding the previously elucidated mechanisms; the rationale for the reported variability in symptomatology among COVID-19 patients is extensive and intricate. It is evident that NK cells exert a significant influence on symptom severity, and their absence, with the presence or absence of their surface receptors, elicits a tailored response to the virus.

SARS-CoV-2-negative hamsters were placed in close proximity to infected dogs, and viral infection in hamsters was confirmed by infection-associated histopathological changes. SARS-CoV-2 exposure led to notable neurological effects in hamsters, including blood-brain barrier damage, activated immune response, and neurodegenerative changes. This study is the first one to confirm that dogs can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other species and demonstrates that cross-species viral transmission can contribute to central nervous system pathology and promote neurodegenerative processes. These findings underscore the importance of further investigating dog-to-other species transmission pathways and early-stage neuropathological impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background Respiratory microbiome alterations, coinfections, and virus intrahost evolution are of great interest in persistently viable SARS-CoV-2 infections in the context of antiviral treatment and immune response. However, samples before, during, and after infection are seldom available to researchers. Therefore, there has been a significant lack of opportunities to comprehensively study microbiota homeostasis, coinfections, and virus intra-host evolution on the consensus and minor variants scale in response to antiviral treatments and patient immune response. Case presentation A 63-year-old female patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received multiple treatments for SARS-CoV-2 that remained active 169 days. Together, 32 respiratory and 19 serum samples were collected before, during, and after (− 398 to 233 days) COVID-19. Subsets were selected for virus viability testing by culture (20) and subgenomic (sg) RNA (20) measurement, intra-host evolution assessment (18), microbiome composition analysis (28), and coinfection identification (11). IgA/IgG and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured 19 times throughout the infection. SARSCoV-2 lineage XBB.1.16.11 persisted and remained viable until 116 days post infection (PI) regardless of treatments. No sgRNA marker tested was suitable for virus viability prediction. IgG/IgA antibodies first appeared after 38 days, but the virus persisted regardless of multiple plasma treatments before neutralizing antibodies appeared (100 days PI) and finally cleared the virus 116 days PI. Consensus-level mutations fluctuated around 102.7 ± 4.0, and minor variants increased from six to 61 with a mutation rate of 4.9 × 10−3 per site per year, with the highest average number of mutations per gene length in S and E (0.013) with surges after every antiviral treatment. The transversion/transition ratio increased from 0.50 (day 0) to 0.57 (day 24) with a steady decrease to 0.48 (day 147). Mutational signature analysis showed dominance of C > T substitutions consistent with APOBEC antiviral enzyme activity. Upper respiratory microbiota showed three distinct profiles with varying α-/β-diversity and an association of Staphylococcus spp. with COVID-19. Conclusions These findings further elucidate the dynamics of intra-host viral evolution and complexities of virus clearance in individuals with hematological malignancies and highlight the impact of antiviral treatments on the potential of virus variants emergence in longitudinally infectious patients due to delayed immune response.

Neurological symptoms associated with long COVID include anxiety, depression, and memory impairment. However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Using golden hamsters as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persistently infect the brain, as viral RNA and replicative virus are detected in the brainstem 80 days after the initial infection. Infected hamsters exhibit a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, characterized by overexpression of innate immunity genes, and altered expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, in energy metabolism, and in proteostasis. These infected animals exhibit persistent depression-like behavior, impaired short-term memory, and late-onset signs of anxiety. Finally, we provide evidence that viral and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, contributing to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.">

        <tr id="The focal “hot spot” neuropathologies in COVID-19 infection are revealing footprints of a hidden underlying collapse of a novel ultrafast ultradian Piezo2 signaling system within the nervous system. Paradoxically, the same initiating pathophysiology may underpin the systemic findings in COVID-19 infection, namely the multiorgan SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular pathologies and brain–body-wide systemic pro-inflammatory signaling, depending on the concentration and exposure to infecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This common initiating microdamage is suggested to be the primary damage or the acquired channelopathy of the Piezo2 ion channel, leading to a principal gateway to pathophysiology. This Piezo2 channelopathy-induced neural switch could not only explain the initiation of disrupted cell–cell interactions, metabolic failure, microglial dysfunction, mitochondrial injury, glutamatergic synapse loss, inflammation and neurological states with the central involvement of the hippocampus and the medulla, but also the initiating pathophysiology without SARS-CoV-2 viral intracellular entry into neurons as well. Therefore, the impairment of the proposed Piezo2-induced quantum mechanical free-energy-stimulated ultrafast proton-coupled tunneling seems to be the principal and critical underlying COVID-19 infection-induced primary damage along the brain axes, depending on the loci of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and intracellular entry. Moreover, this initiating Piezo2 channelopathy may also explain resultant autonomic dysregulation involving the medulla, hippocampus and heart rate regulation, not to mention sleep disturbance with altered rapid eye movement sleep and cognitive deficit in the short term, and even as a consequence of long COVID. The current opinion piece aims to promote future angles of science and research in order to further elucidate the not entirely known initiating pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Multiple studies have reported dysregulated myeloid cell states in patients with bacterial sepsis or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their relevance to viral infections other than COVID-19, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a multi-cohort analysis of single cell and bulk transcriptomic data from 1845 patients across 25 studies. Our meta-analysis revealed a conserved severity-associated gene signature pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM) and increased IL1R2 expression in monocytes and neutrophils from patients with bacterial sepsis, COVID-19, and influenza. Analysis of tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients showed that IL-6 signaling blockade partially reduces this signature and results in a compensatory increase in G-CSF. To validate the role of these cytokines in vivo, we used a mouse model of influenza infection that recapitulates severity-associated increases in IL1R2+ monocytes and IL1R2hi neutrophils, and demonstrate that combined IL-6 and G-CSF blockade inhibits their production. Our study demonstrates the cooperative role of G-CSF and IL-6 in driving the production of severity-associated IL1R2+ myeloid cells and highlights the link between myeloid dysregulation and tissue injury during severe infection.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) can infect a wide range of animal species, including swine and rodents. Infection in pigs is associated with significant economic losses in the global pork industry and is characterized by acute, often fatal disease, as well as central nervous system (CNS) invasion, which leads to neurological manifestations. Although PRV replication has been extensively characterized in certain murine neuronal cell lines such as Neuro-2a, the mechanisms underlying PRV-induced neuroinflammatory injury and necroptosis remain largely unclear. In this study, Kunming mice and mouse astrocytes (C8-D1A) were infected with PRV-GXLB-2013 at different doses to evaluate neurological injury and inflammatory responses. Given that the NF-κB/MLKL signaling pathway was found to be activated during PRV infection, a selective MLKL inhibitor, necrosulfonamide (NSA), was applied to investigate the role of necroptosis in PRV-induced neuroinflammatory damage. Mice infected with higher viral doses showed increased mortality, severe neurological symptoms, elevated brain inflammation, and pathological changes. In C8-D1A cells, PRV infection significantly upregulated inflammatory cytokines and key components of the NF-κB/MLKL pathway. Importantly, NSA treatment markedly reduced these inflammatory responses, mitochondrial damage, and cellular necrosis.

        <tr id="Background: In just twenty years, three dangerous human coronaviruses—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed critical gaps in early detection of emerging viral threats. Current diagnostics remain pathogen-focused, often missing the earliest phase of infection. A virus-agnostic, host-based diagnostic capable of detecting responses to viral intrusion is urgently needed. Methods: We hypothesized that the lungs act as biomechanical instruments, with infection altering tissue tension, wave propagation, and flow dynamics in ways detectable through subaudible vibroacoustic signals. In a matched case–control study, we enrolled 19 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls across two Johns Hopkins hospitals. Multimodal data were collected, including passive vibroacoustic auscultation, lung ultrasound, peak expiratory flow, and laboratory markers. Machine learning models were trained to identify host-response biosignatures from anterior chest recordings. Results: 19 COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls (mean BMI 32.4 kg/m2, mean age 48.6 years) were successfully enrolled to the study. The top-performing, unoptimized, vibroacoustic-only model achieved an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67–0.92). The host-covariate optimized model achieved an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.94–1.0), with 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 82–100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI: 85–100%). Vibroacoustic data from the anterior chest alone reliably distinguished COVID-19 cases from controls. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that passive, noninvasive vibroacoustic biosignatures can detect host response to viral infection in a hospitalized population and supports further testing of this modality in broader populations. These findings support the development of scalable, host-based diagnostics to enable early, agnostic detection of future pandemic threats (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04556149).">

        <tr id="Machupo virus (MACV), a member of the Arenaviridae family and causative agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, results in lethality rates of 25–35% in humans. Mice lacking the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1−/−) have previously been shown to succumb to MACV infection within 7–8 days via the intraperitoneal route. Despite these reports, we observed partial lethality in STAT-1−/− mice following challenge with wild-type MACV. Serial sampling studies to evaluate the temporal progression of infection and pathologic changes after challenge revealed a two-phase disease course. The first phase was characterized by viral load and pathological lesions in the spleen, liver, and kidney followed by a second, lethal phase, defined by high viral titers and inflammation in the brain and spinal cord resulting in neurological manifestations and subsequent mortality. Tissue adaptation in the brains of challenged STAT-1−/− mice resulted in a fully lethal model in STAT-1−/− mice (mouse-adapted; maMACV). A similar two-phase disease course was observed following maMACV challenge, but more rapid dissemination of the virus to the brain and overall pathology in this region was observed. The outcome of these studies is a lethal small rodent model of MACV that recapitulates many aspects of human disease.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) poses a significant threat to human health. The outcome of IAV results from the viral-host interaction, with the underlying molecular mechanisms largely unknown. By integrating the plasma proteomics data of the IAV-infected patients into the viral-inflammation protein-protein interaction (VI-PPI) network created in this study, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), the critical enzyme in purine salvage, was identified as a potential hub gene that connected the different stages of IAV infection. Extended survival rates and reduced pulmonary inflammatory lesions were observed in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-specific PNP conditional knockout mice upon H1N1 infection. Mechanistically, PB1-F2 of IAV was revealed as a novel viral transcriptional factor to bind to the TATA box of PNP promoter, leading to enhanced purine salvage in H1N1-challenged AECs. The activation of PNP-mediated purine salvage was verified in IAV-infected patients and A549 cells. PNP knockdown elicited a purine metabolic shift from augmented salvage pathway to de novo synthesis, constraining both viral infection and pro-inflammatory signaling through APRT-AICAR-AMPK activation. Moreover, durdihydroartemisinin (DHA), predicted by VI-PPI as a novel PNP inhibitor, exerted beneficial effects on the survival and weight gain of H1N1-challenged mice via its direct binding to PNP. To reveal for the first time, we found that PNP, activated by IAV, plays a hub role within H1N1-host interaction, simultaneously modulating viral replication and hyperinflammation through purine salvage. Our study sheds new light on a “two-for-one” strategy by targeting purine salvage in combating IAV-related pathology, suggesting PNP as a potential novel anti-influenza host target.">

        <tr id="Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affects millions globally, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying acute COVID-19 and its chronic sequelae remain poorly understood. Methods We performed an integrative transcriptomic analysis of three independent RNA-seq datasets, capturing the complete COVID-19 pathophysiology from health through acute severe infection to post-acute sequelae and mortality (n=142 total samples). We implemented a containerized analytical pipeline from data download, quantification, differential gene expression to uniformly process these three RNA-seq datasets. Results Our analysis reveals striking molecular dichotomies contrasting disease phases with profound clinical implications. Acute severe/critical COVID-19 reveals predominant enrichment of TNF-α signaling via NF-κB pathways (normalized enrichment score >2.5, FDR <0.001), reflecting a cytokine storm pathophysiology characterized by rapid inflammatory developments involving IL-6, TNF-α, and anti-apoptotic responses. In contrast, PASC patients exhibit dominant enrichment of Myc Targets V1 and Oxidative Phosphorylation pathways (NES >2.2, FDR <0.005), indicating important shifts toward cellular adaptation. Pathway signature analysis identifies core differentially expressed genes that reliably distinguish disease phases, thereby offering objective biomarkers for precision diagnosis and monitoring. Conclusions These findings establish a comprehensive molecular framework distinguishing acute inflammatory from chronic metabolic COVID-19 phases, with potential clinical applicability. TNF-α/NF-κB pathway signatures identify patients at risk for severe disease progression, while Myc/OXPHOS signatures allow objective PASC diagnosis, addressing current reliance on subjective and eliminative diagnosis. This integrative analytical framework has utility beyond COVID-19, offering an applicable approach for precision medicine implementation across other diseases processes. Clinical Significance This study transforms COVID-19 from a symptom-based to a molecularly-defined disease spectrum, enabling precision diagnosis, prognostic monitoring, classification, and targeted therapeutic possibilities based on pathway-specific biomarkers rather than subjective clinical assessments.">

        <tr id="Severe sepsis can escalate to acute lung injury (ALI), a critical condition with limited treatment options. Emerging research highlights the role of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), in regulating epithelial and immune cell responses in sepsis-induced ALI. This study delves into the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis to elucidate its potential in this context. The conducted experiments using Th17 cells differentiated from CD4+ T cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood, co-cultured with transfected Calu-3 cells. The assessed cell viability, RNA, and protein expression levels under inflammatory stimuli. In addition, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues from a cecal ligation and puncture mouse model. Quantification of RNA and protein expression of inflammatory and survival markers provided insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved. Peripheral blood samples from sepsis/ALI patients and healthy controls revealed that circAGFG1 expression is significantly downregulated, while miR-195-5p expression is upregulated in patients compared to healthy individuals. In both Calu-3 cells and induced Th17 cells, as well as in sepsis-induced ALI mouse models, the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis was shown to regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines, Th17 cell differentiation, and markers of epithelial cell survival. Results show the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. Targeting this axis could present a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing ALI in sepsis and other conditions characterized by heightened lung inflammation. This research paves the way for new treatment approaches, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients suffering from severe sepsis and ALI.

        <tr id="Abstract Infection with SARS-CoV-2 continues to be a threat to human health. Despite successful immunization campaigns, effective treatment of COVID-19 remains an essential need to help patients and prevent the spread of new virus strains. Viroporins are intracellular ion channels that are essential for virus replication and release, thus presenting promising pharmaceutical targets. Mutations found in variants of concern (VOC) are expected to increase the virulence of the new virus strains. Recognizing the effects of these mutations at the molecular level is essential for the development of improved therapies. Here, we characterized the putative viroporin ORF3a found in VOCs of SARS-CoV-2, using expression constructs containing a myc-tag for identification, and an optional membrane-directing signal peptide. Additionally, constructs containing N-terminal fluorescence protein tags were prepared. Expression and cell surface transport in HEK-293 cells were studied using Western blot and dot blot assays, and the cellular distribution of fluorescent-marked ORF3a was studied using subcellular organelle markers and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Viroporin activity of all ORF3a constructs was assessed using cell viability and metabolic assays, as well as patch-clamp recordings of recombinant ORF3a. All ORF3a mutants were expressed well in the recombinant system, and the presence of a signal peptide increased expression on the cellular surface. Intracellular distribution was similar for all variants. The VOC mutants ORF3a-S171L and ORF3a-Q57H showed reduced cytotoxic activity and sensitivity to the viroporin inhibitor rimantadine, respectively, suggesting these positions to be relevant for ORF3a function and a starting point for the search of novel antiviral drugs.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections. This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. Methods This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. Results Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Discussion Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and systemic immune responses, particularly through the gut–lung axis. Disruptions in gut microbial diversity and function—commonly referred to as dysbiosis—have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed the gut bacteriome and permeability in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using 16S sequencing and ELISA assays, respectively. We also measured blood inflammatory cytokines and fecal secretory IgA to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Significant alterations in both alpha and beta diversity metrics were observed in patients with COVID-19 (n = 79) and those with post-COVID-19 condition (n = 141) compared to the controls (n = 97). Differential abundance and taxonomic analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles in the infected groups. Increased plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and zonulin were detected in patient samples. Some genera were elevated during acute infection, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia-Shigella were associated with increased zonulin levels, indicating compromised intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the gut–lung axis and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota could support immune regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Viral and bacterial lung infections place a significant burden on public health. Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican’s potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host’s immune response to lung infection. However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

        <tr id="Vasculitis and vascular injury are induced in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, suggesting an association between multi-organ failure and sequelae. Vascular endothelial dysfunction induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disrupts vascular barrier function, activates coagulation pathways, and induces extravasation of inflammatory cells. In addition to employing standard anti-inflammatory and antiviral agents, using treatments that stabilize and protect blood vessels following SARS-CoV-2 infection is a potentially effective strategy to relieve COVID-19 severity. Here, we focused on the vasoprotective effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid mediator with diverse activities, and investigated whether it could be a novel therapeutic for COVID-19. Three-dimensional cultures of various human vascular endothelial cells that form luminal structures showed increased expression of LPA4 and entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, mimicking blood vessels in vivo. Validation using this culture system showed that LPA attenuated SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced vascular destruction and the activation of inflammatory signaling. In experiments with infected animals, LPA administration protected blood vessels and suppressed inflammation and vascular damage in lung tissue. The activation of LPA signaling in vascular endothelial cells may be an effective therapeutic approach for mitigating vascular injury in COVID-19.

        <tr id="Background The global circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an increasing number of reinfections, raising concerns about their clinical and immune consequences. Understanding the differences in disease severity, vaccination impact, and immune response between primary infections and reinfections is essential for guiding public health strategies. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 2023 to June 2024. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection cases were matched 1:2 with primary infection cases using nearest neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) to balance age, sex, and comorbidities between the groups. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, serum antibody levels, lymphocyte subsets, and the impact of vaccination on disease severity were analyzed. Results A total of 907 patients were included, comprising 821 with primary infection and 86 with reinfection. After matching, 131 cases remained in the primary infection group and 75 in the reinfection group. No significant differences were observed in disease severity, mortality, or most clinical symptoms. Trend analysis revealed that an increasing number of vaccine doses was significantly associated with a decreasing trend in severe disease in both the primary infection group (P = 0.0221) and the reinfection group (P = 0.0449). IgG levels were significantly higher in reinfected patients (P < 0.001), whereas IgM levels showed no significant difference (P = 0.474). Among patients with primary infection, severe cases exhibited lower T cell counts than non-severe cases (P < 0.001), but no significant differences in T cell subsets were observed between non-severe and severe reinfections. Conclusions The higher IgG levels in reinfected individuals suggest a robust immune memory response, while T cell depletion plays a crucial role in severe primary infections. Vaccination provided a protective effect against severe disease in both primary and reinfected individuals, with a significant decreasing trend in severe/critical cases as the number of vaccine doses increased.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with platelet hyperreactivity and increased rates of arterial and venous thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2 mutations have resulted in several variants with differences in transmissibility, infectivity, and patient outcomes. This study investigates the effects of the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 (WA1) and two variants of concern, Delta and Omicron, on the human megakaryocyte (MK) phenotype and transcriptome. Human CD34+-derived MKs were incubated with WA1, Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants for 24 hours. MK activation markers were measured under resting and thrombin-stimulated conditions. RNA-seq and cytokine release in response to the viruses were assessed. Plasma cytokines were measured in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Treatment of MKs with WA1, Delta or Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in similar increases in classical activation markers. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants mediated distinct transcriptomic changes. Across variants, 60 genes overlapped, including CXCL8. Consistent with transcriptomic changes, SARS-CoV-2-incubated MKs secreted significantly elevated levels of IL-8. Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, plasma IL-8 levels were highest in COVID-19 patients who subsequently experienced thrombotic events or died. In conclusion, WA1, Delta, and Omicron similarly induce classical MK activation responses while mediating distinct transcriptomic changes. Increased IL-8 levels may serve as a biomarker to inform platelet hyperreactivity and thrombotic events associated with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes millions of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths per year globally. Early-life RSV infection is also associated with the subsequent development of wheezing and asthma, which exhibits sex-related disparities in incidence, epidemiology, and morbidity. The mechanisms that underlie these sex-specific effects are not clear. We have developed a combined infection-allergy model in which 10-day old mice are infected with RSV and subsequently exposed to a common allergen, house dust mite (HDM). We show that early-life exposure to RSV enhanced allergic lung inflammation upon HDM exposure 10 days after viral infection. Early-life RSV infection increased levels of the innate cytokine, IL-33, in the lung 6h following HDM exposure. Accumulation of CD11cmed eosinophils and group 2 innate lymphoid cells was more prominent in the lungs of female mice exposed to both RSV and HDM. Moreover, the numbers of IL-13+ T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) in the lung were significantly increased in mice exposed to both RSV infection and HDM, although the expression of ST2 (the cognate receptor for IL-33) was not linked to T cell cytokine production. Inflammatory responses were maintained when the interval between RSV infection and HDM exposure was extended to one month. Thus, our results show that early exposure to RSV increased numbers of innate cells as well as T cells in response to a common allergen, whether delivered within days or after several weeks of viral infection and that most responses were enhanced in female mice. Our work highlights sex-specific impact of early-life viral infection on the developing lung, and suggests possible mechanisms to explain the subsequent predisposition to enhanced allergic responses long after viral clearance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT NK cells are critical for immunosurveillance, yet become dysfunctional when chronically stimulated by virally infected or cancerous cells. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less characterized, limiting therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, with remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3‐expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating, and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a wide range of acute and chronic disease manifestations. While most infections are mild, a significant number of patients develop severe illness marked by respiratory failure, thromboinflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction. In addition, post-acute sequelae—commonly known as long-COVID—can persist for months. Recent studies have identified the emergence of diverse autoantibodies in COVID-19, including those targeting nuclear antigens, phospholipids, type I interferons, cytokines, endothelial components, and G-protein-coupled receptors. These autoantibodies are more frequently detected in patients with moderate to severe disease and have been implicated in immune dysregulation, vascular injury, and persistent symptoms. This review examines the underlying immunological mechanisms driving autoantibody production during SARS-CoV-2 infection—including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, and bystander activation—and discusses their functional roles in acute and post-acute disease. We further explore the relevance of autoantibodies in maternal–fetal immunity and comorbid conditions such as autoimmunity and cancer, and we summarize current and emerging therapeutic strategies. A comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced autoantibodies may improve risk stratification, inform clinical management, and guide the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies.">

        <tr id="Although COVID-19 was originally considered a respiratory illness, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have far-reaching impacts on the nervous system. Neurological symptoms such as chemosensory dysfunction are frequently observed during acute infection and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases will go on to develop new or persistent long-term symptoms, a condition known in the literature as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) or by the patient-coined term Long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The emergence of Long COVID has prompted renewed interest in the study of post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly in the area of neuroimmune interactions. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of literature on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, with an emphasis on neuroimmune mechanisms drawn largely from autopsy studies and animal models. A more complete understanding of neuroimmune crosstalk in Long COVID will not only guide the development of therapies for this highly disabling condition but will also contribute to our general understanding of neuroimmune interactions in health and disease.">

Objective: This review synthesizes global and regional COVID-19 prevalence data and examines the neurological manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and long-term implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the nervous system. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, clinical studies, and epidemiological data from 2019 to 2025 was conducted, focusing on neurological outcomes, prevalence, and rehabilitation strategies. Results: Neurological manifestations range from mild symptoms (e.g., headache, anosmia) to severe conditions (e.g., stroke, encephalopathy). Mechanisms include direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Long COVID is associated with persistent cognitive, psychiatric, and autonomic dysfunction. Conclusion: The neurological impact of COVID-19 is significant and multifaceted, necessitating early diagnosis, targeted interventions, and further research to address long-term sequelae.">

        <tr id="Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules present intracellular peptides on the cell surface to enable CD8+ T cells to effectively control viral infections. Many viruses disrupt this antigen presentation pathway to evade immune detection. In this study, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 impairs both the constitutive and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced upregulation of HLA-I. Moreover, Nsp1 also blocks IFN-γ-induced expression of HLA-II. We found that, contrary to previously published work, the early SARS-CoV-2 B 1.1.7 Alpha variant lacking the accessory protein ORF8 retained full capacity to downregulate HLA-I, comparable to an ORF8-expressing wild-type isolate. While ectopic overexpression of ORF8 could reduce HLA-I surface levels, this effect was only observed at high expression levels. In contrast, moderate expression of the viral protein Nsp1 was sufficient to potently suppress both basal and IFN-γ-induced HLA-I, as well as HLA-II expression. To probe the underlying mechanism, we analyzed HLA-I-associated genes in previously published RNA-sequencing datasets and confirmed that Nsp1 reduces expression of components required for HLA-I biosynthesis and antigen processing. These findings identify Nsp1 as a key factor that impairs antigen presentation pathways, potentially contributing to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate immune recognition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Inflammation, and particularly microglial cells, has become a central feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a calcium‐permeable nonselective channel involved in the pathological mechanism of several inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of TRPM2 in inflammation and microglial activation in the context of PD remains unclear. Here, we combined both in vivo and in vitro PD models to investigate that question. Male and female TRPM2 partial and complete knockout mice were submitted to the 6‐hydroxidopamine mouse model of PD. We assessed microglia and lysosome‐associated protein (CD68) density levels, microglial morphology and cluster classification, CD68 area in individual microglial cells, and the protein levels of six different cytokines in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the striatum. Our results indicate that TRPM2 deletion reduced microglial density, rescued its morphology, decreased CD68 staining area within microglia, and lowered pro‐inflammatory cytokines levels in both male and female mice. To better understand TRPM2 involvement in PD pathology, we selectively knocked‐down TRPM2 in neurons, microglia, or both cells in a human neuron–microglia co‐culture PD model. An improvement in cell viability and a decrease in cell death were observed across the different experimental approaches. Lastly, TRPM2 deletion revealed reduced microglial phagocytosis and decreased expression of inflammation‐related molecules. For the first time, we demonstrated that TRPM2 is a critical mediator of microglial function in the context of PD. Thus, this study suggests that TRPM2 inhibition may offer a novel therapeutic target for PD modification.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are marked by systemic inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, lymphopenia, and chronic immune dysfunction, with limited therapeutic options for recovery. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection, mirrors these immune pathologies, providing a valuable translational model. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy combined with antiviral treatment in cats with effusive FIP. Hematologic, virologic, and immunologic analyses were conducted over 12 weeks. Antiviral therapy reduced cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by downregulating inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. MSC-treated cats demonstrated enhanced immune recovery, evidenced by reduced expression of exhaustion-related transcription factors (IKZF2, ZEB2, PRDM1) and increased regulatory T-cell populations, promoting immune homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes revealed transcriptomic shifts indicative of immune rejuvenation, including elevated memory T-cell markers (IKZF1, GZMK, IL7R) and reduced hyperproliferative lymphocyte subsets. Serum cytokine analysis revealed 3 distinct inflammatory mediator patterns using principal component analysis. Both treatment groups showed transitions toward cytokine profiles resembling those of healthy controls. Notably, residual cytokine elevations persisted at the study’s end, mirroring features of chronic immune dysregulation. PDGF-bb, a marker of tissue repair, was uniquely associated with higher lymphocyte counts, suggesting its role in lymphoid recovery. This study highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction and support durable immune recovery. The findings underscore its translational relevance for addressing severe viral diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, advancing both veterinary and human medicine.">

Various cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and peripheral immune cells, interact in the pathological process of AIS, profoundly influencing the disease's prognosis. This review, for the first time, summarizes the biological functions and interaction mechanisms of microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, their subgroups, and infiltrating peripheral immune cells at different time points and spatial distributions following AIS, from the perspective of spatial single-cell omics. Spatial transcriptomics technology combines high-resolution gene expression information with tissue spatial architecture, enabling researchers to precisely identify the spatial distribution and dynamic crosstalk between CNS-resident cells and peripheral immune cell subsets. Intervening in the interactions between cell subgroups or different cell types and effectively targeting specific subgroups in the target area, may help minimize the negative effects of harmful subsets while enhancing the functions of beneficial ones. The application of spatial single-cell transcriptomics provides an unprecedented perspective for understanding the complex intercellular interactions following stroke, laying the foundation for precision interventions and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Background Recent findings indicate that hyperinflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 are major contributors to the severity and fatality of COVID-19. Pattern recognition receptors, particularly Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4), have been implicated in detecting SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially the spike protein. However, the role of viral structural components in triggering innate immune responses remains poorly understood. Methods and results HEK293 reporter cells, engineered to stably express TLR2 or TLR4, and THP-1 differentiated macrophages were exposed to various spike protein components and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Protein levels of cytokines were detected by ELISA and mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrate that the S1 subunit and full-length spike protein elicit TLR4-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. TLR4 activation was triggered by the monomeric, but not the homotrimeric, form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Conclusions These findings suggest that distinct elements of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein differentially activate TLR4 signaling pathways, driving innate immune and inflammatory responses.

        <tr id="Bibliographic Review: Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19) presents a clinical spectrum from oligosymptomatic to severe and multisystemic inflammation, which may be followed by death. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has as its main human receptor the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is also crucial in the control of the inflammatory response, through the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System ( RAAS). Objective:  Due to the controversial roles of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the aim of this literature review was to address its distribution in the human body, associating it with the severity of COVID-19. Thus, using the terms ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus, a search was performed on the SciELO, PubMed and Scopus platforms. The research revealed that the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 is related to its ability to interact with the host and, consequently, with ACE2 - widely distributed in organs and tissues. Final Considerations: However, since COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease, and ACE2 is critical in controlling inflammation, especially in RAAS, the data compiled in this review infers that ACE2 is more likely to act as a protective factor, against the severity of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Polytrauma with significant bone and volumetric muscle loss presents substantial clinical challenges. Although immune responses significantly influence fracture healing post-polytrauma, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation require further investigation. While previous studies examined either injury site tissue or systemic tissue (peripheral blood), our study uniquely investigated both systemic and local immune cells at the same time to better understand polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation and associated impaired bone healing. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a rat polytrauma model, we analyzed blood, bone marrow, and the local defect soft tissue to identify potential cellular and molecular targets involved in immune dysregulation. We identified a trauma-associated immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cell population that drives systemic immune dysregulation, immunosuppression, and potentially impaired bone healing. We found CD1d as a global marker for TIM cells in polytrauma. In the local defect tissue, we observed Spp1+ monocytes/macrophages mediating inflammatory, fibrotic, and impaired adaptive immune responses. Finally, our findings highlighted increased signaling via Anxa1-Fpr2 and Spp1-Cd44 axes. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of immune dysregulation-mediated nonunion following traumatic injury and provides biomarkers that could function as treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes play pivotal roles in maintaining neural architecture and function. However, their pronounced heterogeneity, especially in reactive states where distinct subtypes can adopt potentially opposing functions (e.g., neuroprotective vs. neuroinflammatory), complicates our understanding of their net contributions to neurological disorders. A critical challenge arises because these functionally distinct subpopulations often coexist, and the lack of precise tools to separately monitor or manipulate them has significantly hindered efforts to dissect their specific roles in disease progression. Here, we address this gap by developing and optimizing fluorescent RNA sensors mediated by endogenous adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) for application in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes. We employed a streamlined screening methodology to enhance sensor specificity and functionality for complement component 3 (C3), a key marker predominantly associated with neuroinflammatory astrocytes, thus enabling subtype-specific tracking and providing a crucial tool for distinguishing these cells within heterogeneous populations. By integrating the biological complexity of astrocytes with the technological precision of ADAR-mediated sensing, this study establishes a robust framework for investigating astrocyte dynamics.">

IHC revealed reduced expression of ACE2, TLR7, and IL-6, and elevated expression of IFN-β by epidermal cells. In the dermis, there was decreased expression of STING, IFN-β, and TNF-α and increased expression of IL-6 in sweat glands.

        <tr id="Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection is known to cause hand-foot-mouth disease, which may develop severe symptoms such as encephalitis, herpangina, and paralysis, leading to pulmonary edema and even death in children under five years old. Existing animal models for EV-A71 pathogenesis have limitations, necessitating novel models to study human-relevant disease mechanisms. Using glycoproteomic profiling to identify EV-A71-interacting proteins, we previously discovered human nucleolin (hNCL) as an attachment molecule that enhances viral binding and infection in vitro. Here, we developed human nucleolin transgenic (hNCL-Tg) mice to investigate EV-A71 pathogenesis in vivo. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, EV-A71-infected hNCL-Tg mice exhibited higher clinical scores, progressive limb paralysis, and increased mortality. Six days post-infection, hNCL-Tg mice showed elevated viral loads in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle, with pronounced EV-A71 VP1 expression in these tissues and the brainstem. Histopathology revealed severe skeletal muscle damage and significant pulmonary edema, characterized by lung congestion, hemorrhage, and erythrocyte infiltration into alveoli. Infected hNCL-Tg mice also displayed elevated levels of encephalitis- and pulmonary edema-associated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13). These findings establish the hNCL-Tg mouse as a robust model for studying EV-A71 pathogenesis and evaluating preclinical therapeutics.

        <tr id="Introduction Cerebral cytokinopathies are key examples of dysregulated cytokine responses. While mouse models with targeted production of individual cytokines have been pivotal in establishing a causal link between cytokines and disease— especially in the central nervous system—they often fail to replicate the complex inflammatory environments seen in various neuropathological conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, where multiple cytokines are upregulated. Methods To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice, by combining transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 (GFAP-IL6 mice) and IFN-α (GFAP-IFNlo mice). Results Our findings reveal that chronic, low-level production of IFN-α, below the typical disease-inducing threshold, significantly accelerates disease progression in GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice compared to GFAP-IL6 mice. The double transgenic mice exhibited progressive ataxia, persistent seizure-like episodes, and reduced survival. Remarkably, the clinical and pathological symptoms remained predominantly IL-6-driven and required the presence of adaptive immune cells. Conclusion In summary, we demonstrate that subclinical levels of IFN-α can markedly exacerbate IL-6-mediated neurological disease, suggesting that future studies, should consider the combined effects of IL-6 and IFN-α.">

        <tr id="Background The spread of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and its subvariants, highly transmissible but responsible of milder disease, has increased unreported infection cases. Identifying unaware infected individuals is crucial for estimating the true prevalence of infection and evaluating the breadth of hybrid immunity. In this study, this challenge was addressed by applying several Machine Learning approaches. Methods A group of 116 participants, vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, was enrolled in the IMMUNO_COV study at Siena University Hospital, Italy. Blood samples were collected before and six months after third vaccine dose. Machine Learning analysis, involving dimensionality reduction techniques, unsupervised clustering methods and classification models, were applied to serological data including antibody responses specific for wild type SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.2 variants. Spike- and nucleocapsid-specific B cells were also assessed in each participant. Results Using dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering, participants are grouped into high- and low-responders, with infected participants mainly distributed within the high-responders. Implementation of a consensus-based approach, including k-NN, RF, and SVM models, identifies 14 participants unaware of previous infection. Their immunological profile, characterized by strong spike- and nucleocapsid-specific humoral and B cell responses, significantly differs from that of non-infected participants. Conclusions Machine Learning approaches are applied to identify participants unaware of prior infection and to dissect their hybrid immunity profiles. Based on serological data, this cost-effective method can be a valuable tool for estimating the true prevalence of infection, improving comprehension of immune responses elicited by vaccination alone or combined with infection, and tailoring public health interventions.">

Co-infection rates with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were high, particularly in the nasopharynx (35.4% and 64.4%, respectively), highlighting the risk of secondary bacterial infections. Diagnostic evaluation showed that RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values and serological markers (IgG, IgM) had high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing infection status. Lower Ct values correlated with higher viral loads and acute infection, while antibody levels reflected immune response dynamics. Significant correlations were observed between bacterial presence and immune parameters such as ACE-2, FASL, and RBD. These findings underscore the importance of integrated diagnostic approaches that consider microbiota, molecular, and immunological markers for effective management of COVID-19 and its complications.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory route. Following intranasal instillation, VSV moves along the axons of olfactory sensory neurons to the olfactory bulb. While within the olfactory bulb the spread of the virus is controlled by microglia activation and the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes, some of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we used mice with conditional deletions of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an adaptor for RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling. By selectively deleting MAVS in neurons, astrocytes, or long-lived myeloid cells, we discovered that RLR signaling specifically within brain-resident myeloid cells is crucial for protection against the virus. Infected mice with a MAVS deletion in these myeloid cells showed normal myeloid cell and leukocyte infiltration into the brain. However, the P2RY12+ microglia showed aberrant expression of genes involved in antigen cross-presentation. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments revealed diminished MHC class I expression on MAVS deficient microglia. Moreover, CNS infiltrating CD8+ T cells had dysfunctional transcriptional profiles. Therefore, our findings indicate that during viral CNS infection, MAVS signaling in brain-resident myeloid cells, presumably microglia, is essential for antigen cross-presentation and the relicensing of protective, infiltrating CD8+ T cells.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and associated with systemic inflammation. Inflammation is an important process that follows infection and facilitates the body's innate immune response and repair of damaged tissue. Polyunsaturated fatty acids play an important role in the inflammatory process. These lipids can target transcription factors to modulate gene expression and protein function. Methods Here, we performed a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis and immunoassays to evaluate whether differences in basal levels of different types of biomarkers can be detected in freshly frozen plasma samples from patients with and without COVID‐19. Results FAME analysis showed a decrease in arachidic acid and myristic acid, but an increase in caprylic acid, palmitic acid, and eicosenoic acid in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Multiple chemokines including IP‐10, MCP‐1, and MIP‐1 beta were increased in the COVID‐19 group compared to the non‐COVID‐19 group. Similarly, cytokines including IL‐1 alpha and IL‐8, and cell adhesion and inflammatory response markers including ICAM‐1 and E‐selectin were greater in the plasma of COVID‐19 patients compared to non‐COVID‐19 patients. Conclusions A baseline signature of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids, cytokines, and chemokines present in the plasma after COVID‐19 viral infection may serve as biomarkers that can be useful in various applications including determination of severity of infection, indication of disease prognosis, and consideration for therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Abstract Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infections pose a significant threat to public health, underscoring the need for deeper insights into host cellular defenses. This study explores the critical role of autophagy‐related protein 5 (ATG5) in lung epithelial cells during P. aeruginosa infection. Single‐cell RNA transcriptomics revealed a pronounced enrichment of autophagy pathways in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2). Using a conditional Atg5 knockout murine model, we demonstrated that ATG5 deficiency in AEC2 compromises survival, hampers bacterial clearance, and increases pathogen dissemination. Additionally, the loss of ATG5 exacerbated inflammatory responses, notably through the activation of the AKT/PI3K/NF‐κB axis and pyroptosis, which culminated in severe lung injury and epithelial barrier disruption. Mechanistically, the absence of ATG5 disrupted mitophagy, leading to intensified mitochondrial damage. This exacerbated condition coupled with the activation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) by the noncanonical caspase‐11, enhancing the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which in turn activated cGAS–STING–NLRP3 signaling in macrophages. These findings highlight the essential role of ATG5 in modulating immune responses and suggest potential therapeutic targets for managing P. aeruginosa‐induced pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. Its high mortality rate reflects limited therapeutic options and a poor understanding of disease-causing signaling. We show that the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for increased mortality in a model of secondary HLH (sHLH). Unexpectedly, neither deletion of the NLRP3-activated pyroptotic effector GSDMD nor combined deletion of the inflammasome-activated cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 conferred strong protection from sHLH. Instead, co-deletion of GSDMD and caspase-8–activated GSDME limited sHLH-driven lethality, demonstrating redundancy in the pyroptotic machinery required to induce sHLH. We also found that bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors prevent NLRP3-driven pyroptosis, which acted by blocking inflammasome priming. BET inhibitors prevented increased NLRP3 levels in diseased tissue, limited the production of sHLH-associated IL-1β, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor, and protected from sHLH pathogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting NLRP3 could limit sHLH and identify clinically relevant bromodomain-selective BET inhibitors capable of eliminating NLRP3-driven pyroptosis and the sHLH cytokine storm.">

        <tr id="The transmembrane protein Tim-3 has received significant attention in recent years as a possible immunotherapy target. This is due to its robust expression on dysfunctional, exhausted, T cells found in the settings of cancer and chronic infection and biochemical evidence suggesting an inhibitory function of Tim-3. However, numerous clinical trials of putative Tim-3 blocking antibodies have yielded modest benefits, at best, in clinical trials for various cancers. Thus, there is a need to more fully understand the function of Tim-3 in vivo. Here we have studied the function of Tim-3 early during a T cell response to LCMV Armstrong, which causes an acute viral infection in mice. We show that Tim-3 is rapidly expressed after infection and that the expression of Tim-3 is associated with acquisition of a type I effector phenotype, including expression of T-bet and downregulation of Tcf-1, by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, we demonstrate that knockout or cytoplasmic truncation of Tim-3 attenuates the acquisition of the effector program by T cells after LCMV Armstrong infection. Together, these data help to clarify the role of Tim-3 during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Immune cell activation is a feature of COVID-19, that leads to cytokine storm which causes neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, related to psychiatric symptoms due to the depletion of neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate which play a major role in adult neurogenesis. ACE2 receptors are expressed in the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in this region is a major factor behind the neuropsychiatric disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain indirectly through neuroinflammation and altered neurochemical signaling and even mild COVID-19 infections can lead to sustained microglial activation, which disrupts neural networks and impairs cognitive function. The long COVID-19 may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in those who recovered and immunological response may affect synaptic pruning and reduced anterior cingulate cortex volume at one year after COVID-19. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC, commonly known as Long COVID is a significant public health concern and "brain fog" is one of the most debilitating cognitive impairments, affecting memory, concentration, and executive function occurring in 88% of cases. Brain fog may be linked to persistent changes in neurotransmitter levels, particularly involving dopamine and serotonin which play an essential role in cognition, attention, and emotional regulation. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the chemokine CCL11, is linked to cognitive impairments in patients with persistent symptoms. Neuroprotective agents that support neuronal health, such as antioxidants and mitochondrial enhancers and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic and direct current enhance cortical excitability are investigated in cognitive recovery. Evaluation of the currently predominant VUM (a Variant Under Monitoring), LP.8.1, and the most recently designated NB.1.8.1, is increasing as 10.7% of global sequences reported recently due to minor mutations in spike protein. In May 2025, TAG-CO-VAC (Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine) advised that the monovalent vaccines targeting against JN.1 or KP.2 lineages are highly appropriate.">

        <tr id="Arthritogenic alphaviruses including chikungunya, Mayaro, and Ross River viruses cause long-lasting musculoskeletal pain and inflammation. However, mechanisms driving chronic disease remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated joint-associated tissues in alphavirus-infected mice at a late stage of infection. Utilizing scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and flow cytometry we identified an accumulation of inflammatory macrophages in joint-associated tissues with elevated Tnf, Nlrp3, Il1b, and H2-Aa expression, and these cells harbored CHIKV RNA. Moreover, we identified an accumulation of CD4+ T cells in joint-associated tissues, which express Ifng. Depletion of CD4+ T cells diminished MHC-II expression on joint macrophages, highlighting their potential role in inflammation. In addition, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of CHIKV replication during chronic disease reduced viral RNA and joint inflammation, suggesting that viral RNA replication promotes chronic joint disease. Our data suggest that macrophages harbor replicating viral RNA and contribute to the sustained joint inflammation associated with chronic alphavirus disease.">

Data We infected human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and human monocytic (THP-1) cells with H3N2 influenza virus A virus and performed transcriptome analysis using next generation RNA sequencing at various times post infection. We report raw sequence data and normalized log2 transformed gene expression values. This data will allow researchers in the field to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways between the two cell types and over times post infection.

        <tr id="The interleukin-2 receptor γ (IL-2Rγ, or γc) is a crucial component of several cytokine receptor complexes. Deficiencies in γc lead to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), characterized by recurrent infections due to the absence or dysfunction of T and NK cells, and nonfunctional B cells. Missense variants in the γc extracellular region are linked to atypical X-SCID with normal counts of T, B, and NK cells and less severe symptoms, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not well understood. This study describes a case of atypical X-SCID with a missense variant (c.420 A > T, p.R140S) in the γc extracellular domain, associated with recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. We found that the R140S variant leads to reduced surface expression and variably affects cytokine receptor signaling. Specifically, STAT5 phosphorylation and proliferation in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells are impaired in response to IL-7, a cytokine essential for T cell survival, proliferation and function. Notably, γcR140S predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to WT γc, which is found in acidic compartments. Despite this mislocalization, γcR140S does not trigger unfolded protein responses, and its protein stability and degradation pathways remain unaffected. Nevertheless, cells expressing high levels of γcR140S exhibited a competitive disadvantage in culture compared to those expressing WT γc, resulting in the enrichment of cells expressing lower levels of γcR140S. These findings extend our understanding of how mutations in the extracellular domain of γc can lead to reduced protein expression and influence the pathophysiology of atypical X-SCID.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes hemorrhagic, severe infectious diseases and serious economic losses to the pig industry. ASFV multigene family 505 can antagonize the host’s innate immunity through multiple signaling pathways and is considered an important target for vaccine development. However, the mechanism by which it induces host cell damage remains unclear. In this study, we observed that ASFV infection, similar to RSL3, can induce ferroptosis with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron, decrease glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression, and restrain the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor E2-related factor (Keap1-Nrf2) pathway. Moreover, the expression of ferroptosis biomarkers (LOX and PTGS2) has been moderately upregulated. Some proteins related to ASFV replication, invasion, and infection were evaluated for evidence of ferroptosis. MGF505-3R interacts with GPX4 to undergo ferroptosis, resulting in ROS accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential destruction, and NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy elevation. In addition, MGF505-3R suppressed the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, while GPX4 activation counteracted its stimulatory effect on TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-IRF3 phosphorylation. Importantly, the transcription levels of interferon beta (IFN-β), ISG15, and ISG54 were elevated after GPX4 activation, suggesting that ferroptosis resistance could reverse the inhibition of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway and IFN-β levels induced by MGF505-3R. These findings provide new ideas and directions for elucidating the mechanism of ASFV-induced oxidative damage and lay a significant foundation for revealing the pathogenic mechanism of the virus by targeting ferroptosis. IMPORTANCE We revealed that ASFV infection and MGF505-3R transfection induced the accumulation of iron and ROS, resulting in NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and ferroptosis, as well as restricted GPX4 expression and the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. GPX4 activation promotes the TBK1-IRF3-IFN-β pathway and exerts antiviral activity. These findings indicate that ASFV facilitates ferroptosis, providing a proof of principle that may be applicable to oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation manipulation-based therapy for ASFV infection. Given the GPX4 downregulation in ASFV infection, GPX4 activation and ferroptosis resistance highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for viral infection.

Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one such comorbidity that significantly elevates the risk of severe viral infection from coronaviruses, namely, SARS-CoV-2.

Hyperglycemia significantly promotes chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, which put diabetics at an elevated risk of critical health outcomes. Additionally, diabetes is hypothesized to amplify viral titers during infection by promoting the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2 and providing a favorable cellular energy environment for viral replication. This review focuses on explaining the mechanisms that link diabetics with more severe COVID-19 disease and exploring some of the mechanisms that contribute to the phenomenon where COVID-19 can promote new-onset diabetes.

        <tr id="While viral pathogens are often subdivided into neurotropic and non-neurotropic categories, systemic inflammation caused by non-neurotropic viruses still possesses the ability to alter the central nervous system (CNS). Studies of CNS disease induced by viral infection, whether neurotropic or not, are presented with a unique set of challenges. First, because brain biopsies are rarely necessary to diagnose viral-associated neurological disorders, antemortem tissue samples are not readily available for study and human pathological studies must rely on end-stage, postmortem evaluations. Second, in vitro models fail to fully capture the nuances of an intact immune system, necessitating the use of animal models to fully characterize pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic approaches. Non-human primates (NHP) represent a particularly attractive animal model in that they overcome many of the limits posed by more distant species and most closely mirror human disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. Here, we review NHP infection models of viruses known to infect and/or replicate within cells of the CNS, including West Nile virus, the equine encephalitis viruses, Zika virus, and herpesviruses, as well as those known to alter the immune status of the brain in the absence of significant CNS penetrance, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the current era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV−2. This review focuses on viruses with an established role in causing CNS disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, and myelitis and NHP models of viral infection that are directly translatable to the human condition through relevant routes of infection, comparable disease pathogenesis, and responses to therapeutic intervention.">

This study investigated the potential of sEVs as biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant patients, focusing on their role in organ transplants. Plasma samples from five lung transplant recipients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and five healthy controls were analyzed. The sEVs were isolated using an Invitrogen Exosome Isolation Kit, characterized by Nanosight NS300 for particle size (< 200 nm), and quantified for protein concentration using the BCA assay. Extracted protein from the sEVs was subjected to SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and western blotting to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. The results showed that the isolated sEVs from infected lung transplant patients contained significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins compared to those from the control group. Western blot analysis revealed strong bands corresponding to the spike and nucleocapsid proteins in infected patients, with statistical significance (p < 0.0001 for spike protein and p < 0.05 for nucleocapsid protein). These findings indicate that sEVs may serve as biomarkers for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these results and explore the broader therapeutic applications of sEVs in disease contexts. This study supports the potential utility of sEVs in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and monitoring transplant status, warranting additional investigation into their diagnostic value.">

        <tr id="Introduction Azithromycin improves symptomology in various chronic airway diseases exacerbated by viral infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the apparent antiviral effects of azithromycin remain unclear. Methods Airway epithelial cells from healthy children were cultured, expanded and differentiated into air-liquid interface cultures. Submerged and differentiated primary cultures were treated with 10 µM of AZM for 24 h and subsequently infected with human rhinovirus (HRV)-1b for 24 h. Virus receptor expression, replication, progeny release and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, −6, −8 and IP-10) were then measured. Barrier integrity was determined via qPCR, in-cell western (ICW), immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, confocal microscopy, transepithelial electrical resistance (RT) measurement and an apparent permeability (P app ) assay. Results Treatment with AZM for 24 h at the concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 µM did not have any significant impact on either cellular viability or cytotoxicity in un-infected cells. No significant effect on viral receptor, cytokine expression was observed in non-infected cells treated with 10 µM AZM. Similarly, there was no significant change in both occludin and ZO-1 expression in non-infected cells. However, claudin-1 gene expression was significantly reduced but corresponding protein expression was significantly increased following 10 µM AZM. Although RT was significantly lower, this was not corroborated by any significant change in epithelial permeability after 10 µM AZM treatment. Subsequent to HRV-1b infection, 10 µM AZM treatment significantly reduced cytotoxicity induced by infection. Viral receptor expression were not affected with AZM pre-treatment but a significant decrease in viral replication was observed. Except for IP-10, expression of IL-1β, −6, and −8 was significantly reduced. Gene and protein expression of key epithelial junctions were significantly higher in treated, infected cells, which were concomitant with epithelial barrier function. Discussions This study identified that AZM can protect against HRV-1b-induced epithelial damage. Our data, demonstrating the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and barrier-protective effects in vitro are strongly indicative of pleiotropic mechanisms of AZM for mitigating viral infection and its consequences. These effects are likely to contribute to the benefits observed in clinical trials of AZM in a number of chronic respiratory diseases.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke ranks among the top global causes of disability and mortality, with a highly dynamic pathological process. Post-stroke neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia, demonstrates a dual role in both injury and repair. The CX3CR1/CX3CL1 signaling axis, highly expressed in microglia, acts as a key regulator. This review examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of the axis across the stroke process and its involvement in neural repair. Crucially, this signaling pathway demonstrates stage-dependent functional duality: its cellular sources, receptor expression profiles, and functional consequences undergo temporally orchestrated shifts, manifesting coexisting or interconverting protective and damaging properties. Ignoring this dynamism compromises the therapeutic efficacy of targeted interventions. Thus, we propose a triple precision strategy of “stroke phase—biomarker—targeted intervention”. It uses specific biomarkers for precise staging and designs interventions based on each phase’s signaling characteristics. Despite challenges like biomarker validation, mechanistic exploration, and cross-species differences, integrating cutting-edge technologies such as spatial metabolomics and AI-driven dynamic modeling promises to shift stroke therapy toward personalized spatiotemporal programming. Temporally targeting CX3CR1 signaling may offer a key basis for developing next-generation precision neural repair strategies for stroke.">

It is further developed immuno-lung organoids comprising hPSC-derived alveolar and airway organoids co-cultured with macrophages to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of macrophage-mediated lung damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        <tr id="COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in providing strong immunity within a relatively short time frame, significantly reducing both the severity of the disease and associated mortality. However, post-vaccination complications, particularly neurological disorders, have been reported. Among the more frequently documented neurological complications are acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis (TM), optic neuritis (ON), Bell's palsy (BP), and Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). The precise role of COVID-19 vaccines in triggering the onset or relapse of these conditions remains uncertain. Immunological processes involving cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, and immune cells are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of these neurological side effects. This review examines the immune responses triggered by COVID-19 vaccines and their potential role in the development of such complications. Despite reports of neurological side effects, these cases remain rare, and the overall benefits of vaccination in curbing the pandemic and preventing severe illness far exceed the risks. It is vital to sustain the progress of global vaccination efforts while continuously evaluating the risk-benefit ratio, particularly for individuals with underlying conditions. Ongoing research and surveillance are crucial for creating safer vaccines and identifying individuals who may be more susceptible to adverse reactions, ensuring broader protection against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Introduction Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, and neuroinflammation are common features present in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and glial cells are essential mediators of the inflammatory reaction. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor engaged in regulation of immune function, may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, through modulation of neuroinflammation. This study explores how AhR affects astrocyte function in response to inflammatory stimuli, with emphasis on Aβ. Methods and Results In primary hippocampal astrocyte cultures from wild type (WT, C57BL6/J) or AhR germline knockout (AhRKO) mice, pretreatment with the AhR agonist, 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ), attenuated Aβ-induction of reactive astrocyte development, characterized by decreased astrocyte complement C3 expression and decreased proinflammatory cytokine release. In addition, Aβ exposure exacerbated TNF-a cytokine release and increased GFAP immunoreactivity in astrocytes derived from AhRKO mice. In response to Aβ injection into the mouse hippocampus in vivo, AhRKO mice demonstrated increased astrocyte hypertrophy, reinforcing AhR function in regulating astrocyte responses to neuroinflammation. Discussion These findings suggest that AhR activation in astrocytes attenuates development of the neuroinflammatory state, and identifies AhR as an interesting therapeutic target to mitigate neuroinflammation and the progression of AD.">

        <tr id="Background Pathological inflammation with a loss of synaptic integrity and function has been implicated in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although therapeutics exist to increase the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH), they are not effective at preventing neuroinflammation and HIV induced neuronal damage persists. In this study, we investigate the ephrin-B/EphB axis, which regulates inflammation, in post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and experimental models in order to assess its potential role in HIV induced neuroinflammation. Methods We analyze mRNA samples of post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and uninfected controls obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) and, for comparison, of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Follow-up experiments employ mouse brain tissue and in vitro models, including immortalized human microglia, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mixed neuroglial cell cultures, cellular and molecular interference, functional and multiplex assays, immunofluorescence and mRNA sequencing to examine the role of the ephrin-B/EphB axis in neuroinflammation and the associated neurotoxicity. Results Using qRT-PCR we find increased expression of EphB2 in post-mortem brain of PLWH, and detect a correlation with pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and an inverse correlation with abstract executive function and verbal fluency. Increased expression of ephrin-B/EphB at mRNA and protein level is also observed in brains of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV suggesting the upregulation can be driven, at least in part, by expression of viral gp120 envelope protein and a type I interferon, IFNβ. Additionally, we find induction of ephrin-B1 expression in microglia following activation by IFNβ. Given the previously reported impact of EphB2 on inflammation in the periphery, the functional role of EphB2-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling on microglia is assessed for a pro-inflammatory and anti-viral signature. We find that EphB2 treated microglia secrete inflammatory and anti-viral factors but also exert contact-independent neurotoxicity. Finally, knockdown of microglial ephrin-B1, an EphB2 binding partner, shows a partial alleviation of the microglial pro-inflammatory signature and neurotoxicity. Conclusion Our study suggests that elevated EphB2, and its reverse signaling through ephrin-B1 in microglia contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in neuroHIV.

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

        <tr id="Complement dysregulation and immune hyperactivation are pivotal factors contributing to the mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Engineered Antibody-like proteins (ALPs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are engineered to address immune dysregulation in COVID-19. In this study, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41, two such ALPs, are developed using cDNA display technology. These ALPs demonstrate strong binding affinity for the spike protein and effectively inhibit its interaction with ACE2 and several C-type lectins, including MBL, DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 suppress complement activation via the lectin pathway, reduce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and attenuate hyper-inflammatory responses. In mouse models, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 significantly mitigate inflammation, NETosis, and lung tissue damage induced by the spike protein. These results suggest that these ALPs hold promise as therapeutic candidates for alleviating SARS-CoV-2-induced immune dysfunction, with the potential to reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes and long-term sequelae. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting spike protein-mediated immune modulation as an innovative approach to combat COVID-19.">

Despite established interactions between muscularis macrophages and neurons, the presence and function of other immune cell types remains poorly characterized. Here, we mapped the muscularis immune cell landscape, revealing that diverse cell types are present within distinct locations of the GI tract, and they lie in proximity to neuronal cell bodies and their axons. Using a hypothesis-free computational approach, we identify putative ligand–receptor interactions from publicly available single-cell RNA datasets and further validate one of these (App-CD74). This study provides a valuable reference to encourage new avenues of research underpinning enteric neuroimmune interactions as key contributors to GI homeostasis and diseases.">

        <tr id="Objective: Various cellular pathologies in leukocytes contribute to the pathology of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we
aimed to determine the prognostic significance of netotic and pyroptotic cell deaths in relation to disease severity in COVID-19 pathophysiology.
Materials and Methods: Serum samples were collected from a total of 150 patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, as defined by
the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines, along with 89 healthy individuals. Circulating markers of netosis and pyroptosis, including
neutrophil elastase (NE), citrullinated histone H3 (CitH-H3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18, and
IL-8, were analyzed using the ELISA method. The effects of netosis and pyroptosis markers on disease severity and clinical parameters were
comparatively evaluated, and their associations with inflammation, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis were also investigated.
Results: NE, GSDMD, IL-18, MPO, CITH3, D-dimer, leukocyte and lymphocyte levels, as well as inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin), showed
a significantly elevated in severe COVİD-19 patients compare to the other groups.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that circulating netosis and pyroptosis markers in SARS-CoV-2 infections correlate with inflammation,
dysregulated hemostasis, and fibrinolysis markers, playing a role in disease prognosis. These associations may provide potential therapeutic
targets for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with demyelination and microglial activation. Significant progress has recently been made in the development of strategies to treat MS with a focus on microglial cells. In response to injury, microglia, a population of mononuclear phagocytic cells, change from quiescent to activated. M1 microglia produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause additional injury, thus they are considered neurotoxic microglia. M2 microglia release anti-inflammatory factors that lead to the suppression of inflammatory responses; therefore, they have a neurotrophic phenotype. The balance between M1 and M2 phenotypes is important for nerve recovery. In neurodegenerative diseases, activated microglia are excessively shifted toward M1 or neurotoxic phenotype due to microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. The miRNA as a class of non-coding RNAs, control the neuroinflammatory process by activation of microglia. The miR-124 is partly responsible for suppressing the neuroprotective and inflammatory processes by preventing microglia activation. Meanwhile, the microRNA 155, which is induced by pro-inflammatory agents in microglia, promotes the inflammatory process. Several studies have shown that in MS pathogenesis, miR-124 as an anti-inflammatory marker is significantly downregulated, while miR-155 shows an increase. In this study, we will investigate the role of miR-124 and miR-155 in the activation and alteration of microglial phenotype. Finding the relationship between microRNAs and glial cells and inflammation in MS may be used as a therapeutic method to reduce the symptoms in MS patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes play a crucial role in mediating neuroinflammation, particularly under pathological conditions where they can enter into senescent or gliotic states. This study explored the induction of these two astrocytic states using the same stressor, palmitate, in primary cortical astrocytes. A transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct expression profiles both astrocytes phenotypes. Senescent astrocytes upregulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest and the Senescence‐Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), including IGFBP5, CDKN1A, and p53. In contrast, reactive astrocytes upregulated genes related to immune response, complement activation, and inflammation, such as C3, LCN2, and pro‐inflammatory cytokines like IL‐11 and CXCL12. Despite these differences, both astrocytic states shared pro‐inflammatory characteristics, contributing to neuroinflammation. The secretory profiles further distinguished the two states: senescent astrocytes produced higher levels of interleukins, including IL‐6 and IL‐18, indicative of sustained inflammatory responses. Gliotic astrocytes, on the other hand, secreted higher levels of chemokines, such as MCP‐1 and GRO‐α, involved in immune cell recruitment and tissue repair. Senescent astrocytes were more active in cytokine production, while gliotic astrocytes promoted immune responses and tissue repair through chemokine production. Understanding these distinct roles provides valuable insights for developing therapeutic interventions to mitigate neuroinflammation and support healthy brain aging.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has affected at least 989 dairy herds across 17 states in the United States (U.S.) and resulted in 70 confirmed human infections, underscoring the urgent need to understand the pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions of emerging H5N1 viruses. In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections.">

Using SARS-CoV-derived ssRNA sequences, we modeled age-dependent immune responses in mice. Aged mice exhibited higher mortality and severe lung inflammation upon viral ssRNA challenge, mirroring clinical observations. We uncovered a pre-existing inflammatory state in aged mice, characterized by elevated baseline levels of specific immune cells and cytokines correlating with poor outcomes. Age-related immune dysfunction stemmed from impaired IRF7 signaling and defective SNARE-mediated cytokine secretion in CD11b+ cells. Notably, the adoptive transfer of young CD11b+ cells to aged mice exposed to SARS-CoV2 ssRNA reduced mortality, alleviated lung inflammation, and normalized cytokine profiles. These findings provide insights into age-related immune dysregulation during viral challenges and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19 in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Increased iron levels, common in neurodegenerative diseases, correlate with disease severity, suggesting a role in the pathological process. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the role of iron in cerebral inflammatory processes. Employing astrocyte cell models of genetic neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by iron imbalance, such as the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders, can provide valuable insights into astrocytes reactivity, a pivotal process in brain inflammation. Specifically, we employed human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes from Neuroferritinopathy, where iron accumulation is primary. After confirming iron accumulation and the deregulation of proteins involved in iron management, we observed that at 35 days since the beginning of differentiation, the elevated iron levels not only trigger ferroptosis but also place the astrocytes in a reactive state. This is evident in the higher extracellular concentrations of IL-6, IL-1β, and glutamate, along with changes in morphology, genes, and proteins involved in astrocyte reactivity. Interestingly, by day 60, IL-6 and IL-1β levels drop below those of the controls, and we observe a reversal in most of the factors considered. Moreover, at day 60, it is possible to observe not only increased senescence but also ferroptosis. These findings demonstrate that iron plays a primary role in inducing astrocyte reactivity.">

However, its high infectivity makes comprehensive research with the active virus challenging. Here, we use virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type mice and in mice that express the human tau protein. VLP exposure elicits changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings in primary somatosensory and motor cortices reveal substantial short-term increases in cortical activity in VLP-injected mice, with increased stimulus-evoked activity in both genotypes and elevated spontaneous activity in the human tau genotype only. Vehicle-injected human tau mice also show increases in cortical activity patterns. Over the following weeks, activity metrics partially subside but do not completely return to baseline levels. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. Middle-aged human tau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background and overexpression of the tau protein, exhibit more severe pathobiology and may be at risk for more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGluR4, encoded by Grm4), is a neurotransmitter receptor, known to play roles in tumor progression and immune modulation through the nervous system. Here we show that mGluR4 may regulate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME) also via non-neuronal mechanisms. We observe that dendritic cells (DC) from mGluR4-deficient mice display enhanced migration, maturation and antigen-presentation capacity, which promote T cell and NK cell responses against tumor cells. Tumor growth and metastases are suppressed in Grm4-/- mice in different preclinical tumor models, including orthotopic liver cancer, subcutaneous melanoma, colorectal tumors, and fibrosarcoma. We show that the tumor suppressive effect of Grm4-deficiency requires host immunity, in particular CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and IFNγ, but independent of the nervous system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and ex vivo assays show changes in the composition and functional state of the immune TME. Mechanistically, mGluR4 suppresses the adenyl cyclase/PKA signaling pathway, leading to metabolic reprogramming of DCs. Importantly, adoptive transfer of DCs pretreated with the AC agonist forskolin therapeutically suppressed tumor growth in an orthotopic liver cancer model. Our study thus demonstrates that mGluR4 is a checkpoint for DC maturation and that mGluR4 may serve as an immunotherapeutic target.">

As a newly identified type of cell death, its involvement in poxvirus infection and pathogenesis remains unclear. Since MPXV shares biological and pathogenic similarities with other poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus (VACV), we used VACV-infected cell and mouse models to demonstrate that VACV infection induces ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of ferroptosis significantly reduce virus replication and alleviates the inflammatory response. Additionally, we observed that VACV infection upregulates prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which contributes to virus-triggered ferroptosis and inflammation. This study identifies a novel form of cell death triggered by poxvirus infection, shedding light on host–pathogen interactions and offering a potential therapeutic target for MPXV and other Orthopoxviruses.">

While essential for controlling viral replication, their infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS)—an immune-privileged site—raises potential concerns regarding immunopathology. This review explores the dual roles of CD8 T cells during ZIKV infection, emphasizing both their antiviral functions and their potential to drive neuroinflammation. We examine how ZIKV infection and chemokine-mediated signals facilitate immune cell trafficking across the blood–brain barrier, drawing parallels with other neurotropic flaviviruses. We also explore how therapeutic agents, such as the S1P receptor modulator FTY720, influence lymphocyte trafficking and CNS immune regulation. Finally, we review emerging interventions—including vaccines, antivirals, immunomodulators, and passive immunotherapies—that aim to achieve effective viral control while minimizing neural damage. A balanced understanding of immune cell responses in flavivirus infections is essential for guiding future therapeutic strategies against ZIKV and related neurotropic viruses.">

Current treatments rely on symptomatic treatment and glucocorticoids without a standardized guideline. This study investigated the mechanism of abnormal lymphocyte function in acute-phase SFTS and glucocorticoid-induced alterations in lymphoid cells using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis. Three healthy volunteers and 13 patients in the acute phase of SFTS were enrolled in the experiment and divided into four groups. We performed scRNA-seq from the 3' end of mRNA on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples from the 16 participants. Bioinformatics analysis was used to profile patient immunograms and elucidate subpopulation compositions, developmental trajectories, and lymphoid cell interactions. We obtained 120,886 lymphoid cells that were then divided into 23 functionally heterogeneous subsets. The result shows that severe SFTS patients had a stronger inflammatory and acquired immune response. Glucocorticoid treatment can suppress inflammation and interferon response but inhibit the production of virus-specific antibodies. These findings suggest that proper glucocorticoid administration could mitigate the hyperinflammatory state in severe SFTS cases at the acute disease stage, though it is not recommended as a conventional treatment due to potential antiviral immune suppression. This study provides insights into SFTS immunopathology and guides optimized glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="The global dissemination and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become a worldwide crisis with staggering confirmed cases and death tolls. Although prophylactic vaccines are widely applied to curb the spread of the virus, these protections are greatly weakened by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Non-structural protein 12 (NSP12) of SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays an essential role in viral replication and transcription, representing a promising target for drug development. Currently, extensive drugs are designed to specifically target and inhibit NSP12 activity, while highly infectious and drug-resistant variants have significantly compromised their efficacy. Here, we identified that arsenic trioxide (ATO) could specifically reduce not only WT SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 but also mutant NSP12 levels, along with low toxicity. Moreover, the reduction of NSP12 was caused by its robust ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after ATO treatment. Of note, STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 was found to be the E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of NSP12 by ATO. In short, our findings provide a potential intervention to restrict virus replication and may broaden the scope of therapeutic application for ATO.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been widely recognized as a respiratory illness, yet growing evidence highlights its significant neurological and psychiatric impact. Neuropsychiatric manifestations range from mild symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, to severe conditions including delirium, stroke, and psychosis. These symptoms may occur during the acute phase or persist long after recovery, contributing to what is known as long COVID. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial, involving direct viral invasion, immune response, and psychosocial stressors. Understanding these effects is essential for comprehensive patient care and for developing long-term strategies in neuropsychiatric evaluation and treatment. This literature review was conducted using scientific publications found in the following databases: Virtual Health Library (BVS), Public Medline (PubMed), CAPES Periodical Portal, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), with no time restriction. The official websites of the Ministry of Health and gray literature were also consulted. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the extensive neuropsychiatric impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting individuals across all age groups and clinical profiles. Both acute and long-term manifestations—ranging from cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders to severe neurological complications—underscore the virus’s capacity to disrupt central and peripheral nervous system function, as well as mental health. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, early identification of symptoms, and a multidisciplinary approach to treatment are essential to mitigate these outcomes. Given the ongoing burden of long COVID, continued clinical vigilance, mental health integration into routine care, and investment in longitudinal research are crucial. As we transition from pandemic to endemic phases, addressing the neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 must remain a global public health priority.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and function in the central nervous system, including their involvement in reparative processes. Here, we examined how a common mutation in the homeostatic iron regulatory gene, H67D HFE, impacts the antioxidant mechanism of astrocytes and migration under normal and reparative conditions. Previous data from our group suggested that this mutation may modify disease progression through an antioxidant mechanism involving nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferritin. In this study, we used primary murine astrocytes with either the H67D or wild‐type HFE genotype to determine whether astrocytes contribute to the antioxidant protective mechanism previously observed. We analyzed their antioxidant profile and migration both at baseline and after a scratch wound injury. We found that H67D HFE astrocytes expressed the HFE protein and exhibited an enhanced antioxidant profile, marked by increased glutathione and GPX4 at baseline, and a reduced migration length into three‐dimensional granular hydrogel scaffolds. However, following scratch wound injury, these astrocytes exhibited a shift in migratory behavior, leading to faster wound infiltration. Moreover, their antioxidant response became even more pronounced after injury, with increased expression of Nrf2, GPX4, and H‐ferritin (FTH1). These results suggest that the mechanism underlying HFE mutation neuroprotection in disease processes involves an antioxidant profile in astrocytes, which is increased upon insult to activate the astrocytic reparative mechanism.">

        <tr id="Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a spectrum of disease outcomes in infected humans, ranging from asymptomatic or tolerant to lethal. While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the host’s response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.">

        <tr id="Orthoflaviviruses, a group of arthropod-borne viruses, represent a significant global health threat, with hundreds of millions of infections each year, often leading to severe clinical outcomes. This Review elucidates the complexities of immune imprinting, also known as original antigenic sin (OAS), and its influence on immune responses to repeated, heterologous orthoflavivirus infections. We examine how initial exposure to a virus can shape subsequent immune responses, potentially resulting in sub-optimal binding of pre-existing antibodies to related but distinct viruses. Although OAS is often linked with adverse outcomes, such as enhanced disease severity in dengue due to antibody-dependent enhancement, we re-introduce the concept of “antigenic seniority,” which highlights the potential advantages of prior exposures by promoting cross-protection against related variants. This perspective underscores the dual nature of immune imprinting and its implications for vaccine development and therapeutic strategies against orthoflavivirus infections. By exploring the delicate balance between protective and maladaptive immune responses, we emphasize critical considerations for developing effective vaccines and interventions in the context of evolving viral threats.">

        <tr id="Despite targeting mainly the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 disrupts T cell homeostasis in ways that may explain both acute lethality and long-term immunological consequences. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the T-cell-mediated chain of immunity and formation of TCR via TREC assessment in COVID-19 and long COVID (LC). For this study, we collected 231 blood samples taken from patients with acute COVID-19 (n = 71), convalescents (n = 51), people diagnosed with LC (n = 63), and healthy volunteers (n = 46). With flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (i.e., naïve, central and effector memory cells (CM and EM), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1, and subpopulations of effector cells (pE1, pE2, effector cells)). Additionally, we measured TREC levels. We found distinct changes in immune cell distribution—whilst distribution of major subpopulations of T cells was similar between cohorts, we noted that COVID-19 was associated with a decrease in naïve Th and CTLs, an increase in Th2/Tc2 lymphocyte polarization, an increase in CM cells, and a decrease in effector memory cells 1,3, and TEMRA cells. LC was associated with naïve CTL increase, polarization towards Th2 population, and a decrease in Tc1, Tc2, Em2, 3, 4 cells. We also noted TREC correlating with naïve cells subpopulations. Our findings suggest ongoing immune dysregulation, possibly driven by persistent antigen exposure or tissue migration of effector cells. The positive correlation between TREC levels and naïve T cells in LC patients points to residual thymic activity. The observed Th2/Th17 bias supports the hypothesis that LC involves autoimmune mechanisms, potentially driven by molecular mimicry or loss of immune tolerance.">

        <tr id="Acute thymic involution (ATI) is frequently observed during sepsis, however the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in sepsis-associated ATI. We found that pediatric sepsis patients showed significantly elevated kynurenine (Kyn)/tryptophan (Trp) ratios, indicating increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) activity, along with higher Kyn levels compared to controls. Moreover, Kyn levels were negatively correlated with thymus-to-thorax ratio. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that the enhanced expression of IDO1, induced by inflammatory signals, drives the accumulation of Kyn and subsequent activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), triggering lipid oxidation-related gene transcription and ferroptosis in thymocytes during sepsis. Treatment with 1-methyltryptophan (IDO1 inhibitor) effectively restore thymic function and improve survival in septic mice. Our findings reveal a novel role for the IDO1/Kyn/AhR pathway in ferroptosis, suggesting that targeting this pathway may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for sepsis.

        <tr id="The 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic has largely subsided, but a key question remains. How did ZIKV evolve to become a virulent human pathogen compared to the virus of its original discovery? What specific virologic and pathologic changes contributed to increased pathogenicity in humans? Phylogenetic studies have identified two genetically distinct ZIKV, the African and Asian lineages, which differ in their pathogenicity. Previous studies including ours suggest that the envelope (E) protein plays a key role in viral entry, immune activation, and neuropathogenesis. This study aimed to further elucidate virologic and pathogenic differences between these lineages by assessing their ability to bind and replicate in host cells, induce apoptotic cell death, trigger inflammatory responses, and influence human neural progenitor cell (hNPC)-derived neurosphere formation. We compared a historic African ZIKV strain (MR766) with an epidemic Brazilian strain (BR15) and evaluated the effects of the E protein inhibitor quercetin-3-β-O-D-glucoside (Q3G) and an E protein-neutralizing antibody (AbII). Our results revealed distinct virologic properties and that MR766 exhibited stronger inhibition of neurosphere formation due to enhanced viral binding to neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, while BR15 infection triggered a heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine response with reduced viral binding. Chimeric virus studies suggested that the E protein likely influences viral binding, replication efficiency, immune activation, and neuropathogenesis. Notably, Q3G exhibited antiviral activities against both MR766 and BR15, whereas AbII preferentially inhibited MR766. These findings highlight the virological differences between ancestral and epidemic viral strains, as well as the critical role of E protein in viral permissiveness, immune response, and neuropathogenesis, providing insights for developing targeted antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Infection with salmon gill poxvirus (SGPV) can lead to acute disease outbreaks with high mortalities caused by extensive gill pathology. In some cases, additional signs of severe red blood cell breakdown (erythrophagocytosis) are present in the spleen and kidney. This can indicate a broader systemic effect of the infection, extending beyond the gills. In a previous study, we investigated the gill histopathology and transcriptome response of salmon sampled from such an outbreak. Here, we further investigate these responses in the same fish, focusing on the haematopoietic organs. Results Results show that extensive accumulation of red blood cell breakdown products and phagocytosis of red blood cells were seen in the salmon suffering from salmon gill poxvirus disease. Moreover, differentially expressed genes exhibited an apparent organ-specific pattern, with a primary function involved in immune response, which was predominantly observed in the spleen and kidney. Additional antiviral responses, as well as coagulation and vascular function, apoptosis, and stress responses, were also detected in haematopoietic organs. Conclusions In conclusion, salmon gill poxvirus disease (SGPVD) affects haematopoietic organs, causing red blood cell breakdown and organ-specific immune responses. Gene expression patterns highlight immune activation, antiviral defence, coagulation, and stress pathways in the spleen and kidney of salmon suffering from SGPVD.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce the severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to prolonged phenotypic and functional changes.


METHODS
Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I cell proliferation after antigen presentation.


RESULTS
We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days after RSV infection, especially impacting genes associated with MHC. Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data demonstrate that RSV can induce prolonged upregulation of antigen presentation by LECs, with the potential to facilitate local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens and to enhance immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Background Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium caused by a variety of reasons, with myocardial cell necrosis and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration as the main manifestations. Pedunculoside (PE) plays a protective role in inflammatory diseases; however, it’s effect and mechanism on myocarditis remains unexplored. Methods In this study, we evaluated the cardioprotective effects of PE in vivo and in vitro using the LPS + ATP-induced cardiomyocyte injury model and the LPS-induced rat myocarditis model, and elucidated its potential mechanism. Results We found that PE demonstrated inhibition of H9c2 cell death and decreased ROS, Ca2+ levels, and MMP loss induced by LPS + ATP. Moreover, PE improved cardiac function in LPS-induced myocarditis rats. Mechanistically, PE suppressed the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, PIP2, and MAPK signaling pathways, which are associated with P2X7R. Additionally, PE interfered with and attenuated the interaction between P2X7R and PIP2, displaying strong docking activity with P2X7R. Conclusion Taken together, PE exhibited significant anti-myocarditis activity by interacting with P2X7R and inhibiting the NLRP3, PIP2, and MAPK pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for clinical myocarditis treatment.">

        <tr id="We recently developed an original HCV-permissive cell culture model based on both partial differentiation and physiological oxygen pressure (Hypo-Diff cells) that produces highly infectious lipid-rich and native-like HCV-lipoviroparticles (LVPs). Here, we explored the precise role of physiological hypoxia and related specific transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) to better understand the mechanism governing viral morphogenesis. Knocking-down HIF-2α specifically reduced both the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets in Huh7.5 Hypo-Diff cells, suggesting a central role for HIF-2 in controlling lipid metabolism under physiological hypoxia. In HCV-infected siHIF-2α Hypo-Diff cells, both HCV replication and the specific infectious viral efficacy of progeny viruses were significantly impaired. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of a mutated form of the HIF-2α protein, stabilized in normoxia, both increased the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets and restored the production of highly infectious HCV viruses in the absence of cell differentiation. Finally, by iodixanol fractionation of supernatants to determine the mean buoyant density of infectious HCV LVPs, we established that HIF-2α is exclusively responsible for producing highly lipidated and broadly infectious HCV-LVPs by Hypo-Diff cells. These findings thus clearly establish the central role of physiological hypoxia, and notably HIF-2, in the production of highly infectious lipid-rich native-like HCV particles. Since physiological hypoxia is a shared characteristic in mammalian tissues, we propose to reconsider the role of natural oxygen tension and especially the role of HIF-2 in the life cycle of other lipid-associated viruses, whether hepatotropic or not.

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, remarkable progress has been made in the development of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Several direct-acting antivirals, such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, offer clinical benefits. These agents have significantly contributed to reducing the viral loads and duration of the illness, as well as the disease’s severity and mortality. However, despite these advances, important limitations remain. The continued emergence of resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants highlights the urgent need for adaptable and durable therapeutic strategies. Therefore, this review aims to provide an updated overview of the main antiviral strategies that are used and the discovery of new drugs against SARS-CoV-2, as well as the therapeutic limitations that have shaped clinical management in recent years. The major challenges include resistance associated with viral mutations, limited treatment windows, and unequal access to treatment. Moreover, there is an ongoing need to identify novel compounds with broad-spectrum activity, improved pharmacokinetics, and suitable safety profiles. Combination treatment regimens represent a promising strategy to increase the efficacy of treating COVID-19 while minimizing the potential for resistance. Ideally, these interventions should be safe, affordable, and easy to administer, which would ensure broad global access and equitable treatment and enable control of COVID-19 cases and preparedness for future threats.">

        <tr id="Brain atrophy is a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and more recently SARS‐CoV‐2 infection for which the neuroinflammatory mechanism is not fully understood. Nevertheless, neuroinflammation and CD8 T cell accumulation is frequently observed in postmortem brain tissue of patients with neurodegeneration. We therefore developed a murine model of brain atrophy using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection model of multiple sclerosis. We employ single major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule conditional knockout mice generated by our program to analyze the contribution of immune cell infiltration and onset of atrophy. TMEV infected C57BL/6 mice that singularly express H‐2Kb or H‐2Db were evaluated. TMEV infection of these mice resulted in ventricular atrophy at 14 d.p.i. However, H‐2Db expressing mice presented with significantly greater and continuous ventricular atrophy compared to H‐2Kb expressing mice and MHC class I knockout control mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed H‐2Db expressing mice had greater brain infiltrating CD8 T cell responses at 7 and 28 dpi which correlated with the extent of ventricular atrophy. Meanwhile, H‐2Kb and MHC class I knockout mice also had distinct positive correlations with ventricular atrophy and global neuroinflammation in general. These findings support the role of immune cell infiltration into the CNS as a putative mechanism of ventricular atrophy following TMEV infection, with the progressive enlargement of ventricular atrophy observed in H‐2Db mice being associated with the presence of long‐lived memory CD8 T cells residing in the brain.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
This review highlights recent advances in single cell "-omics" technologies that have transformed our understanding of the HIV reservoir in the central nervous system (CNS) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).


RECENT FINDINGS
Recent studies have applied single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CITE-seq, AIRR-seq, multiomic platforms, and spatial transcriptomics to postmortem brain tissues and CSF. These analyses have revealed that HIV persists in rare subsets of CNS-resident microglia and trafficking CD4+ T cells despite ART. Infected microglia often display inflammatory transcriptional states, while clonal T cell populations harboring HIV can migrate between blood and CSF. Spatial and multimodal approaches are uncovering both the tissue localization and epigenetic regulation of infected cells, offering unprecedented insight into reservoir biology and neuropathogenesis.


SUMMARY
Single cell studies have established the CNS as a transcriptionally active and clonally maintained reservoir of HIV during ART. These findings underscore the need for cure strategies that penetrate the brain, target both lymphoid and myeloid reservoirs, and consider the transcriptional, epigenetic and spatial context of HIV-infected cells. Ongoing technological advances will further illuminate the dynamics of the CNS reservoir and guide the design of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers and CNS-penetrant therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The immunoregulatory functions and clinical implications of APOE+ macrophages within the tumour microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma remain incompletely defined. In this study, single‐cell transcriptome analysis revealed distinct subsets of APOE+ macrophages, and subsequent CellChat analyses highlighted that these cells predominantly interact with other components of the tumour microenvironment via MIF‐(CD74+CXCR4) and MIF‐(CD74+CD44) signalling pathways, thereby contributing to the establishment of an immunosuppressive milieu. Integrating mutation profiles with multiple machine learning techniques, we developed an APOE+ Macrophage‐related Risk Model (ARM) through a combination of RSF and Ridge approaches, achieving the highest prognostic accuracy (C‐index) among all tested algorithms. The robustness and predictive value of the ARM model were validated across seven public cohorts and three prospective immunotherapy cohorts. Patients classified in the low‐ARM group consistently exhibited better prognoses, as demonstrated by survival analyses, ROC curves and PCA discrimination. Additionally, multiplex immunofluorescence analysis in the in‐house cohort confirmed significantly decreased infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ and CD20+ immune cells in the high‐ARM group, further supporting a more pronounced immunosuppressive microenvironment in these patients. Collectively, our findings not only clarify the critical role of APOE+ macrophages in shaping the immune landscape and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, but also provide a validated, practical risk model for individualised patient prognostication and clinical management.">

        <tr id="Stroke significantly alters microglial immune status beyond the traditional M1/M2 classification. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from the striatum of hemorrhagic, ischemic, and control mice, revealing activation of mitochondrial autophagy and assembly processes after stroke. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis indicated that stroke-associated genes predominantly regulate mitochondrial maintenance, with leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (Lars2) markedly upregulated in post-stroke microglia. A distinct microglial subset (Mc) was identified with notably low Lars2 expression. In vitro, Lars2 overexpression enhanced mitochondrial function, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and suppressed Mc marker gene expression. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed Mc as the most interactive microglial subset following stroke, particularly engaging with neurons. Among neuron-Mc signaling pairs, the neurotrophic factor pleiotrophin-syndecan-4 (PTN-SDC4) ligand-receptor pair emerged as a key mediator. Conditioned media from stressed microglia upregulated neuronal Ptn expression, likely recruiting microglia, as exogenous PTN promoted microglial migration. These findings identify Mc as a stroke-induced microglial population with low Lars2 expression and pro-inflammatory features. The lack of compensatory mitochondrial repair in Mc contributes to pro-inflammatory polarization, positioning Lars2 as a mitochondrial checkpoint linking stroke-induced microglial reprogramming to neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="At least 10% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a variety of multisystem symptoms lasting more than 12 wk known as postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or “long COVID.” While the precise pathogenesis of PASC remains unclear, immune dysregulation is widely recognized as a key factor. Moreover, PASC disproportionately affects older individuals who are prone to age-related immune system decline, which further exacerbates the risk and severity of PASC. The oral cavity, a primary site for initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, may contribute to the development and persistence of PASC. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in age-related oral health, such as periodontitis, salivary gland (SG) dysfunction, and gustatory and olfactory impairments, may create an environment conducive to forming an oral reservoir of intact virus or viral antigens, which may contribute to the chronicity of PASC. Alternatively, the pathogenesis of PASC may increase the risk of a wide range of oral health issues, such as dental diseases, dry mouth, and sensory dysfunction (e.g., taste and smell) that are frequently reported by patients with PASC. This review highlights how aging facilitates oral SARS-CoV-2 infection, co-infection with other viruses may drive PASC in aging patients, aging and PASC dysregulate the oral microbiome, SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes molecular mechanisms involved in oral tissue aging, aging oral health affects susceptibility to developing PASC, and inflammation associated with PASC exacerbates dysregulation of metabolic/enzymatic pathways of aging oral mucosa and diseases of the periodontal apparatus, SGs, and taste. It underscores the urgent need to comprehensively address the interplay between aging oral health and PASC, which will help mitigate long-term complications and improve overall health outcomes for affected individuals.">

Patients infected with this virus have shown pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms. The golden Syrian hamster is the ideal animal model miming SARS-CoV-2-induced systematic lesions in humans. 
Materials and Methods: In this study, three groups of four Syrian hamsters were intranasally inoculated with a titer of SARS-CoV-2 at 105.5 TCID50. Groups of inoculated and mock-inoculated uninfected control animals were ethically euthanized at three, six, and ten days post-inoculation to examine the presence of the virus in lung, kidney, liver, and heart tissues using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in order to study the histopathological outcomes. 
Results: In the gross examination, where tissues are under macroscopic examination and given a value from 0 to 4 based on the intensity of involvement, the lung tissues showed significant involvement with SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR results were reported using the Cycle Threshold (CT), and any CT value below 35 indicated a positive result. Histopathologic examinations of the lungs of most hamsters showed pneumonia, while those of the liver and kidneys demonstrated partial involvement with the virus. However, histopathologic examinations of the heart showed no pathological effects. 
Conclusion: This study revealed some clues regarding the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on various organs in the body. It may assist scientists and clinicians in combating the virus by providing a broader and more detailed understanding of its behavior.">

        <tr id="Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a globally prevalent pathogen that can infect a variety of animal species as well as humans. However, existing antiviral therapies are constrained in their capacity to effectively target viral latency and prevent recurrent infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), particularly cathelicidins, as part of innate immune system have demonstrated broad-spectrum efficacy against viral pathogens. In this study, four peptides derived from Elephas maximus cathelicidin EM were designed and optimized (EM-1 to EM-4). We identified low toxicity peptide derivatives through hemolytic and cytotoxicity assays, quantified their anti-HSV-1 activity by determining IC50. Antiviral mechanisms were investigated using RT-qPCR and antiviral efficacy was ultimately validated in C57BL/6J mice through viral load quantification in brain, lung, and heart tissues. Our findings revealed that EM-1 significantly inhibited HSV-1 replication in U251 cells. In a murine footpad inoculation model, EM-1 administration substantially reduced viral loads and alleviated inflammatory responses. Histological assessment demonstrated that EM-1 treatment mitigated HSV-1 induced tissue damage in infected mice. We also found that EM-1 exerted its antiviral effects by upregulating the expression of interferon-gamma and its downstream genes, such as ISG15 and MX1. These findings indicated that EM-1 is a dual function peptide that inhibits replication of HSV-1 as well as enhances host antiviral immunity. Collectively, this study highlights the therapeutic potential of elephant cathelicidin derived peptides in antiviral development.">

In an effort to adapt the virus to grow more rapidly in these cells through the serial passaging of viral progeny, we were unsuccessful. Here, we found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by BoAHV-1-infected A549 cells (referred to as EDVs) contain 59 viral proteins, including both viral structure proteins (such as gC and gD) and viral regulatory proteins (such as bICP4 and bICP22), as identified via a proteomic analysis. These EDVs can bind to and enter target cells, inhibit viral particles binding to cells, and stimulate the production of IFN-α and IFN-β in A549 cells. When EDVs are inoculated into rabbits via either the conjunctival sacs or intravenously, they can be readily detected in neurons within the trigeminal ganglia (TG), where they reduce viral replication and promote the transcription of IFN-γ. Furthermore, incorporation of the known anti-herpesvirus drug Acyclovir (ACY) into the EDVs leads to synergistically enhanced antiviral efficacy. Collectively, the EDVs exhibit antiviral effects by blocking viral binding to target cells and stimulating the innate immune response, thereby leading to the failure of the serial passaging of viral progeny in these cells, and these EDVs may serve as a promising vector for delivering drugs targeting TG tissues for antiviral purposes.">

        <tr id="Abstract In rare individuals with a severely immunocompromised system, chronic infections of SARS-CoV-2 may develop, where the virus replicates in the body for months. Sequencing of some chronic infections has uncovered dramatic adaptive evolution and fixation of mutations reminiscent of lineage-defining mutations of variants of concern (VOCs). This has led to the prevailing hypothesis that VOCs emerged from chronic infections. To examine the mutation dynamics and intra-host genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during chronic infections, we focused on a cohort of nine immunocompromised individuals with chronic infections and performed longitudinal sequencing of viral genomes. We showed that sequencing errors may cause erroneous inference of genetic variation, and to overcome this, we used duplicate sequencing across patients and time points, allowing us to distinguish errors from low-frequency mutations. We further found recurrent low-frequency mutations that we flagged as most likely sequencing errors. This stringent approach allowed us to reliably infer low-frequency mutations and their dynamics across time. We applied a generalized linear model that accounts for gradual mutation accumulation and episodic divergence shifts to infer a synonymous mutation rate of 1.9 × 10−6 mutations/site/day. Using the same framework, we inferred patient-specific non-synonymous divergence rates that exhibited marked heterogeneity across individuals. This framework also uncovered episodes of high non-synonymous rates consistent with selective sweeps or subpopulation replacement. Overall, we observed diverse evolutionary dynamics across chronic infections, highlighting variation in patient-specific selection pressures and within-host demographic histories that shape intra-host viral evolution.">

        <tr id="Objectives Platelet–neutrophil aggregates (PNA) bridge inflammatory processes with the hemostatic system. The goal of this study was the comparative evaluation of PNAs in healthy individuals vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), septic patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and a pre-pandemic control group from 2019. Methods This observational study involved prospective blood sample collection from vaccinated individuals at separate times after immunization with Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, together with the retrospective analysis of laboratory data from COVID-19, sepsis, and control subjects. PNA ratios and anti-S-protein antibody levels were also measured. Results Following primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, PNA levels increased significantly, showing a gradual decline over six months while remaining elevated. Booster vaccinations did not elevate PNA levels. In COVID-19 patients PNA ratios were the highest, while in the patients with sepsis remained comparable to those of the control group. A moderate correlation was found between PNA and anti-S-protein levels after primary immunization (rho = 0.31, p = 0.0071), but no correlation was observed post-booster. Strong associations between PNA and platelet counts occurred in COVID-19 and sepsis groups, while leukocyte and neutrophil counts showed no significant correlations with PNA. Conclusions The results of this study may support the possibility of using PNA ratio assessment for the evaluation of the immune response.">

        <tr id="Abstract Much progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a devastating disease that has impacted North American hibernating bats for nearly two decades. Growth of the causative fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, on exposed epidermal tissue of bats creates an immune reaction that disrupts natural hibernation physiology and leads to premature expenditure of energy reserves and often death. Past work has highlighted the similarities between WNS and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, but other conditions that have not been considered yet may also be relevant. We performed a transcriptomic analysis of wing tissue from naïve and exposed bats to further investigate the implications of observed differential gene expression patterns. For this analysis, we collected wing biopsy samples from 41 individuals prior to WNS emergence and 58 individuals 2–5 years after WNS emergence. We generated poly-A enriched tag-Seq libraries to compare gene expression between these groups. We then linked our findings and those of past studies to other disease systems to build hypotheses regarding mechanisms of WNS pathophysiology. We found an overrepresentation of functions related to programmed cell death and cytokine activity among upregulated genes. Importantly, we also identified upregulation of three S100 damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in exposed populations. Taken together, our findings and those of past studies suggest that infected bats experience a feedback loop of cell death among immune cells, the release of DAMPs and the stimulation of cytokine release that may act to maintain pathological immune activity. This feedback loop likely relates to cytokine storms in individuals with severe infection and possibly deteriorates into sepsis over time. Given the pathophysiology of sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction potentially contributes to the physiological disruption associated with WNS.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a significant pathogen responsible for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which poses a substantial public health concern, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The virus is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route and via respiratory droplets, entering the host via the gastrointestinal tract where it replicates before spreading to the central nervous system. The virus predominantly affects children under five years of age, often resulting in severe neurological complications, including aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and, in some cases, death. Despite the development of vaccines, global control of EV71 remains challenging due to its high genetic variability. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating various cellular processes, such as cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. This pathway is frequently exploited by viruses to facilitate infection and replication. Consequently, therapeutic interventions that target the PI3K/Akt pathway emerge as a promising strategy to combat viral infections, including EV71. Notably, the PI3K inhibitor Pilaralisib has demonstrated efficacy in reducing EV71-induced mortality by 50–80% in animal models. However, its low cellular safety profile poses limitations to its therapeutic potential. This study sought to investigate the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in EV71 infection and the potential of its inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy. We examined the effects of PI3K inhibition on EV71 replication both in vitro and in vivo, exploring the underlying mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the replication of EV71 and that its inhibition could offer a promising approach to preventing or alleviating the severity of HFMD.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bacterial and fungal pathogens are major causes of infectious endophthalmitis following eye surgery or trauma, often leading to vision impairment or blindness. The distinct clinical outcomes observed in bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis suggest differences in host immune responses. To investigate these differences, we utilized cytokine arrays and murine models of bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus) and fungal (Aspergillus fumigatus) endophthalmitis. Our analysis revealed that cytokine responses peaked in bacterial infections at 12–24 h, whereas fungal infections exhibited a delayed peak at 48 h. Several inflammatory mediators, including MMP9, MMP3, CD14, LIX, LCN2, retinol-binding protein 4, ICAM1, and VCAM1, were differentially elevated. Notably, interleukin-33 (IL-33) levels peaked early in bacterial infections but continued to rise throughout all time points in fungal endophthalmitis. Analysis of patient vitreous samples further confirmed higher levels of IL-33 in bacterial (n=40) and fungal (n=20) endophthalmitis cases. Functional studies in IL-33-deficient mice revealed an increased fungal burden and elevated TNF-α and IL-6 levels, but bacterial endophthalmitis severity remains largely unaffected. Additionally, bone marrow-derived macrophages from IL-33−/− mice exhibited increased cell death in response to fungal and bacterial infection. Our findings reveal divergent innate immune responses between bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis and emphasize the immunomodulatory function of IL-33 in ocular infections.">

        <tr id="Microglia, resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play an essential role in responding to pathological conditions by adopting diverse activation states and morphologies. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed that microglial subtypes were heterogeneous based on their gene expression profiles. However, the mechanism on how morphological changes in microglia are correlated with their gene expression profiles remains unclear. The current study aimed to identify a distinct population of rod-shaped microglia, characterized by an elongated morphology, in glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCLC)-deficient mice, a model of glutathione deficiency-induced oxidative stress. In the process of brain atrophy accompanied by neuronal cell death, which was observed in GCLC-KO mice, the rod-shaped microglia emerged in early stages of neurodegeneration and subsequently decreased in number over time. C1q-mediated synaptic pruning has been implicated in microglial activation under pathological conditions. Thus, whether C1q contributes to the formation of rod-shaped microglia was investigated. Notably, the genetic deletion of C1q did not affect the number or distribution of rod-shaped microglia in GCLC-KO mice. These findings suggest that their formation occurs via a C1q-independent mechanism. According to morphological and molecular analyses, the gene expression profile of the rod-shaped microglia was similar to that of the disease-associated microglia (DAM). To investigate the mechanisms underlying their formation, single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on cortical tissues collected from GCLC-KO mice. DAM-like microglial clusters were consistently identified. Further, pathway enrichment analysis suggested the potential involvement of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA, encoded by Plau) signaling. Considering the role of uPA in extracellular matrix degradation and cell migration, it may contribute to the morphological changes in rod-shaped microglia. In addition, the phosphorylation of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a modification linked to structural plasticity, increased in rod-shaped microglia. Based on these findings, uPA signaling and phosphorylated GAP43 may be involved in microglial elongation and alignment along neuronal fibers, which potentially facilitate their migration during early neurodegenerative responses. Taken together, the rod-shaped microglia are a previously unrecognized activated population that emerges early in neurodegeneration and may be involved in disease-related processes. Understanding their molecular regulation can provide insights into early microglial responses and potential therapeutic targets.

Additionally, we identified a common pathogenesis in B-cell subsets of COVID-19 and HIV patients, which showed abnormal activation states of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway.

        <tr id="Background Viral pneumonia is the most common and lethal pandemic disease, but there are no broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with high genetic barriers to resistance. To elucidate the mechanisms of viral pneumonia progression and potential targets for its treatment. Methods Viral pneumonia models were induced by the PR8 virus strain in wild-type (WT) and STING knockout (STING-KO) mice. Series of molecular biology techniques were used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia and cytokine levels. Results In this study, STING (stimulator of interferon genes) was activated in the lungs of virus-infected mice, leading to cytokine production and amplification of the immune response, thereby causing rapid deterioration of symptoms. Furthermore, excessive activation of innate immune response via STING was prevented by a STING inhibitor (C-176), which significantly reduced viral lung inflammation. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was similarly suppressed during viral pneumonia treatment with STING inhibitors (C-176), and NETs formation and STING expression were positively correlated, indicating that STING plays an important role in NETs formation. Symptoms of pneumonia in STING-KO mice infected with PR8 were significantly milder than those in WT mice, and NETs were less likely to form in the lung tissue of STING-KO mice. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed that STING-mediated regulation of NETs may be associated with gasdermin D (GSDMD), and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that STING, GSDMD, and NETs-related proteins interact with each other. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that in neutrophils from WT mice, STING and GSDMD were colocalized on the membrane after viral infection, whereas in neutrophils from STING-KO mice, GSDMD expression was decreased after exposure to the virus. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that targeted intervention with STING alleviated pneumonia by inhibiting inflammation and NETs formation. The study also revealed that blocking STING could inhibit the activation of GSDMD to inhibit NETs formation, slowing the progression of viral pneumonia.">

        <tr id="Cortical injury results in inflammation and cell death that can cause disability, especially in the aged population. Previous studies from our group have demonstrated the efficacy of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) as a therapeutic to mitigate damage and enhance recovery in our aged monkey model of cortical injury. In the first 3–5 weeks following injury to the hand representation of the primary motor cortex, monkeys treated intravenously with MSC-EVs exhibited a more rapid and complete recovery of fine motor grasp compared to vehicle-treated monkeys. However, whether recovery and treatment are associated with temporal changes in peripheral or central biomarkers of inflammation remain unknown. The current study used the highly sensitive Olink® Proximity Extension Assay to assess inflammatory protein biomarkers in blood and CSF across a 6-week recovery period in aged female monkeys. MSC-EV treatment promoted a sustained downregulation of pro-inflammatory proteins in plasma across the entire recovery period, and a transient downregulation of anti-inflammatory proteins at 2 weeks post-injury. Functional annotation and pathway analyses showed that the plasma proteins downregulated with MSC-EV treatment were associated with the suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling. Further, immunolabeling of perilesional brain tissue harvested 6-weeks post injury showed an increase in homeostatic microglial phenotypes with MSC-EV treatment. Downregulation of inflammatory markers in plasma and brain tissue were positively correlated with improved functional recovery. These data suggest that MSC-EVs facilitate recovery of function after brain injury, in part, via sustained suppression of both peripheral and central pro-inflammatory signaling across recovery.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is a growing public health challenge. Neuroinflammation has been proposed as a prominent pathological feature of AD and has traditionally been attributed to the innate immune system. However, emerging evidence highlights the involvement of adaptive immunity, particularly T and B lymphocytes, in the neuroinflammatory processes of AD. It remains unclear how adaptive immune responses, originally intended to protect the body, contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in AD. Here, we review the roles of adaptive immunity, cellular composition, and niches and their contribution to AD development and progression. Notably, we synthesize the crosstalk between adaptive immunity and the innate immune system of the central nervous system (CNS), which is mainly mediated by glial cells and myeloid cells, and their interrelationships with amyloid-β (Aβ)/Tau pathology. We hypothesized that the alterations observed in innate immunity in AD mirror age-related immune alterations, whereas the dysregulation of adaptive immunity contributes more accurately to disease-specific immune responses. Targeting adaptive immunity in the context of neuroinflammation may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies designed to modulate immune responses, thereby facilitating the diagnosis, intervention, and treatment of AD.">

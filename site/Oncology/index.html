        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells play an important role in mediating long-lasting adaptive immune responses to viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2. In the context of the latter, much of our current knowledge stems from studies in vaccinated individuals or repeatedly infected individuals. However, limited knowledge is available on these responses in fully naive individuals in German communities. We performed immunophenotyping of a previously naive SARS-CoV-2 cohort in convalescent individuals after asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19. The samples were collected median 250 days post infection during the first wave of the COVID pandemic in Germany (March – May 2020). In this cohort of 174 individuals, we phenotyped different leukocyte cell populations in peripheral blood (B, T and Natural Killer cells). We then assessed the serostatus against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike subunit (S1) with its receptor binding domain (RBD), as these are important correlates of protection, by testing for presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We also measured IgG antibody responses against the N antigen of the common cold coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, to determine possible cross-reactivity. In a subset of the cohort (n = 76), we performed intracellular staining assays (ICS) after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens. Key findings are significant differences in frequency of CD4+ memory T cell populations, notably CD4+ TEM and CD4+ TEMRA cells, between the group of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and the control group. These differences correlated with cytokine production (TNFα, IFNγ) after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides, indicating a specific T cell immune response. In conclusion, a clear memory T cell and humoral response can be detected up to 250 days post mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Our results underline findings reported by others indicating a lasting cellular immune response even in a population which previously had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Introduction During gestation the immune system undergoes dramatic remodelling to protect the maternal-fetal dyad from infections whilst also preventing fetal rejection. We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 modifies the immune landscape during infection and in recovered pregnant women. Methods We immunophenotyped our two independent geographical cohorts using a 14-colour flow cytometry panel (surface and intracellular staining). We estimated cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in validation cohort using a multiplexd flow cytometry panel. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed using a Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead Chip and Library Kit from 10x Genomics (Drop-seq method). Furthermore, we estimated the cytotoxic functions of natural killer (NK) cells by flow cytometry using surface and intracellular staining. Results Using two independent geographical cohorts, we identified that NK cells had a sustained reduction during active infection and after recovery. Further, scRNA-seq data revealed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 rewired the gene expression profile of NK, monocytes, CD4+, CD8+ effector T cells and antibody producing B cells in convalescent pregnant women. Several gene pathways associated with cytotoxic function, interferon signalling type I & II, and pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in NK and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were attenuated in recovered pregnant patients compared with healthy pregnancies. We validated our scRNA-seq of NK cells from convalescent pregnant women and confirmed that NK cells had diminished levels of cytotoxic proteins; perforin, CD122 and granzyme B. Discussion Overall, our study uncovers that SARS-CoV-2 infection deranges the adaptive immune response in pregnant women even after recovery and may contribute to post-COVID19 sequalae of symptoms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic (‘phase’) markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1) and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1 and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signalling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69 and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells towards persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells. Spectral flow cytometry in an independent MS cohort revealed distinct memory and effector T cell subsets, indicating unique CSF signatures in MS. This study underscores the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of CD4+ T cells detectable by spectral flow cytometry, enhancing diagnostic resolution of CSF cells and informing more precise therapeutic strategies for MS.">

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on public health continue to demand attention as the virus continues to evolve, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures including immune responses, therapeutic treatments, and prophylactic interventions. The SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape remains dynamic, with new subvariants continuously emerging, many harboring spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. In this study, we characterized a panel of live SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those key subvariants implicated in recent waves of infection. Our findings revealed a significant variability in mutation patterns in the spike protein across the strains analyzed. Commercial antibodies and human convalescent plasma (HCoP) samples from unvaccinated donors were ineffective in neutralizing the most recent Omicron subvariants, particularly after the emergence of JN.1 subvariant. Using human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy bronchiolar tissue (hBAEC), we established both monoinfections and coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus H1N1 (IFAV_H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Assessments were conducted to compare viral infectivity and the production and release of immune mediators in the apical and basolateral compartments. Notably, Omicron KP.3.1.1 subvariant induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect in hBAEC compared to its parental strain JN.1 and even surpassed the impact observed with the ancestral wild-type virus (WA1/2020, Washington strain). Furthermore, the coinfection of KP.3.1.1 subvariant with IFAV_H1N1 or RSV did not attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; instead, it significantly exacerbated the pathogenic synergy in the lung epithelium. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-10 were upregulated in hBAEC following SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection with recent Omicron subvariants as well as during coinfection with IFAV_H1N1 and RSV. Taken together, our findings offer new insights into the immune evasion strategies and pathogenic potential of evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their interactions with other respiratory viruses, carrying important implications for therapeutic development and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations have been increasingly reported in COVID-19 patients. Here, we use the Drosophila melanogaster midgut model to investigate SARS-CoV-2-induced GI pathogenesis. The fly midgut exhibits susceptibility to orally administered virus, resulting in disrupted epithelial architecture, reduced organ size, and altered visceral muscle dynamics. These effects are accompanied by sustained proliferation of intestinal stem cells alongside decreased replenishment and viability of differentiated cells. Transcriptomic profiling reveals biphasic perturbations in midgut gene expression, particularly in pathways related to lipid metabolism. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a dichotomous effect on lipid homeostasis, with lipid droplet accumulation in the posterior midgut and depletion in anterior segments. Treatment with Plitidepsin, a COVID-19 drug candidate, mitigates most SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic features in both the Drosophila midgut and human pulmonary cells, while modulating basal lipid droplet homeostasis in uninfected conditions. These findings establish the Drosophila midgut as a potent model for studying SARS-CoV-2 GI pathogenesis and evaluating antiviral compounds.">

        <tr id="Viral infection triggers both cellular and systemic responses in vivo. These are sometimes difficult to study since the immune system is subject to constant challenge from multiple pathogens. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique opportunity arose to measure the body’s immune response during lockdown, when exposure to pathogens from the environment was substantially lower. This allowed measurement of COVID-naïve patients, as well as those who had recovered from COVID-19. The effects of subsequent vaccination and boosters could also be assessed. This offers two advantages; an insight into the humoral response to novel pathogens, and the opportunity to measure the ability of the body to respond to challenge from both new pathogens and those to which exposure had already occurred. In this paper, we used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to analyze the electrophysiological fingerprint of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors who had never had COVID-19, those who had recovered from COVID-19, and those who received first, second, or third vaccine doses. This was performed before and after incubation with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to determine whether differential changes in the electrical properties of PBMCs could be detected and evaluated. Clear trends in response over time were observed, suggesting that DEP could pave the way towards a new correlate of protection (CoP) to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, since the test measures immune response to challenge, it may be widely applicable to other diseases.

        <tr id="Introduction Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the TEC family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, including B lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Selective BTK inhibitors (BTKi) have shown efficacy in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated the role of BTK in human and mouse myeloid cells in in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods We evaluated i) the impact of the BTK inhibitor (BTKi) evobrutinib on monocyte markers for activation, costimulation, adhesion and phagocytosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from healthy and MS subjects; ii) the therapeutic effects and the action of evobrutinib on myeloid cell phenotype in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS; iii) the contribution of BTK in short-lived vs. long-lived myeloid cells to EAE expression via experiments with double transgenic mice allowing inducible inactivation of BTK in CX3CR1 expressing cells. Results We report that BTKi supported monocyte expression of VLA4/CD49d, an integrin directing immune cell migration towards the central nervous system, and CD163, a well-known scavenger receptor involved in removal of myelin debris, in samples from healthy subjects. This effect was maintained under distinct inflammatory settings and replicated with PBMC of MS subjects. Therapeutic intervention with evobrutinib ameliorated EAE severity and was associated with a significant modest decrease in the frequency of CNS-infiltrating proinflammatory macrophages. However, conditional BTK deletion in short-lived or long-lived CX3CR1-positive cells did not reduce EAE severity. Discussion This functional evidence questions the real contribution of BTK expressing myeloid cells to experimental MS.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Analyzing the antiviral response of natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes is essential to understanding vaccine protection in an immunized population facing SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections (BTIs). In this study, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections, we observed an increase in adaptive CD57+NKG2C+ NK cells and classical monocytes (CMs). Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that the transcriptomic profiles of IFN-induced IFIT3 and other IFN-stimulated genes exhibited marked upregulation in NK cells, defined as CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+IFIT3+ NK cells. Additionally, CM in the blood showed characteristics indicative of differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which further evidenced their potential antiviral functions. Our study indicates that a vaccinated population rapidly activates an antiviral innate immune response following a BTI, thus revealing a link to the control of viral replication during SARS-CoV-2 BTIs.">

        <tr id="Identification of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection typically relies on serology, yet T-cells play a key role in the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated in parallel the SARS-CoV-2-specific as well as endemic human coronavirus-specific humoral and cross-reactive cellular responses in children and adults. We analyzed clinical data and blood samples from a family cohort of 96 children and 144 adults at 3–4 and 11–12 months after their first contact with SARS-CoV-2. Humoral response was assessed by a multiplex immunoassay with high sensitivity and specificity (MULTICOV-AB). Cellular responses were analyzed by IFN-γ ELISPOT using four different established epitope compositions (ECs) to discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 specific and HCoV cross-reactive T-cell responses. While the majority of adults had a combined serological and T-cell response, relatively more children had a T-cell response alone rather than a combined response. The magnitude of the T-cell response correlated with symptoms and the humoral response. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly boosted the endemic coronavirus-specific cellular response. Overall, our data suggest discordant humoral and cellular responses, reflecting either abortive infection, cellular sensitization with rapid viral clearance or rapid antibody waning or a combination of these phenomena. Restricting epidemiologic analysis to SARS-CoV-2 serological data may underestimate rates of infection with or at least exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in children.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to global consequences since its emergence in late 2019, impacting health, economies, and societies worldwide. Understanding the early responses following infection will provide crucial insights into the immune mechanisms governing disease progression and protection. We employed the single-cell RNA-sequencing approach using bronchoalveolar lavage cells of rhesus macaques at 0-3 days post-infection (dpi) in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show the increased abundance of two subsets of macrophages that express IFN-responsive gene signatures, inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and conventional DCs at 3 dpi, coinciding with peak viremia. Moreover, our investigation underscores the enrichment of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-1 signaling pathways within myeloid populations at 2-3 dpi in comparison to baseline. These findings substantially deepen our comprehension, elucidating the transcriptional landscape at the single-cell level during the early phases of COVID-19 within a highly relevant model.


IMPORTANCE
Understanding the immune response in the early stages of COVID-19 is crucial for developing better treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the first few days after infection. We identify key immune cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that are activated early on and produce important signals to fight the virus. These findings help clarify how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights that could guide future therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a heterogeneous infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The distinctive features of COVID-19 infection encompass a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe illness involving diverse underlying pathophysiological processes such as hyperinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, thrombotic microangiopathies, and multiple organ failure. However, the host responses to COVID-19, including systemic inflammation and immunity against SARS-CoV-2, remain largely undefined across different disease states. Here, we performed global transcriptome profiling of 228 peripheral blood samples of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations and subsequent clustering using an unsupervised algorithm. We identified various transcriptomic clusters and globally dysregulated immune-related pathways, leading to distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles in severe and critical SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This underscores the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release. Additionally, our results reveal variances in circulating cell populations and the activation of apoptosis and the p53 signaling pathway in lymphocytes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients with diverse clinical presentations offers valuable insights into molecular mechanisms and may inform clinical decisions on anti-inflammatory therapies.

        <tr id="Environmental stress contributes to several disease conditions – including cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and autoimmune disorders – through immune dysregulation. Stress operates through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathoadrenal axes, leading to peripheral secretion of cortisol and norepinephrine, respectively. While stress profoundly influences immune function, the underlying single-cell and cell-type-specific mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed an ex vivo model investigating the transcriptomic responses of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils to physiological stress levels (i.e., levels reached during in vivo stress) of cortisol and norepinephrine at single-cell resolution. We identified novel stress-hormone-dependent and cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes, including uniquely regulated genes and inflammation-related signatures within distinct innate (e.g., CD163+ monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) and other immune cell types. The single-cell-derived signatures, applied to two independent human cohorts, effectively distinguished stress-related diseases. Our findings provide cell-type-level insights into how stress hormones modulate immune function relevant to stress-related conditions.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections involve prolonged viral replication and immune system interactions, potentially driving viral evolution and immune escape. This study examines viral characteristics and host gene expression changes in persistent infections. The nasopharyngeal samples from four patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections at Tottori University Hospital, Japan, were analyzed. Viral isolates were cultured, and infectivity was assessed using TCID50 assays. To investigate host responses, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis mapped affected biological pathways. Viral genome sequencing detected mutations associated with prolonged infection. The results showed significant infectivity differences between early- and late-phase infection. Gene expression analysis revealed a strong early phase of pro-inflammatory response (IL6, TNF, IL1B, CXCL10) followed by immune suppression. GO enrichment analysis highlighted inflammation and cytokine-mediated immune pathways. Genomic sequencing identified mutations in ORF1ab and the spike (S) protein, potentially aiding immune escape. The findings underscore that SARS-CoV-2 adapts during persistent infections, altering infectivity and immune responses. These highlight the need for continued monitoring of prolonged infections to mitigate immune escape and viral evolution.">

        <tr id="Purpose Cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significant variability, yet the role of innate immune responses in the skin of COVID-19 patients remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic profile of skin samples from patients who succumbed to COVID-19. Patients and Methods Skin autopsies from COVID-19 patients with post-mortem time of less than 20 hours were obtained from University of São Paulo Medical School Hospital and healthy skin samples, were submitted to RNA sequencing analysis. Validation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by real-Time PCR. Results Our analysis revealed markedly elevated expression of type I interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral factors, antioxidant enzymes, and components of several cytokine-signaling pathways in COVID-19 skin samples compared to healthy controls. SARS-CoV-2 infection robustly induced numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFITs, IRF, S100 family with a notable enrichment of those associated with antiviral and inflammatory responses. Moreover, the presence of counter-regulatory factors such as SOCS3 and NFKBIA indicate the involvement of anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the skin. Furthermore, deconvolution data indicated increased presence of macrophages other nucleated cells in vessels in the skin of COVID-19 patients, highlighting the involvement of innate immune mechanisms. Conclusion The results revealed cutaneous alterations in the expression of genes associated with innate immunity and inflammation factors. This suggests that, unlike tissues with viral tropism, the skin is enriched with antiviral factors to defend against SARS-CoV-2. This information could be useful for developing specific antiviral therapies.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic pathogen linked to neuropathogenesis in adults, causing conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and fatal encephalitis. Intracranial injection of virus in immunocompromised mice have shown neuroinflammation and subsequent brain damage. However, the mechanisms underlying ZIKV-induced neuroinflammation in immunocompetent adult mice via peripheral infection remain unclear. To investigate this, we utilized a murine model of ZIKV infection via footpad injection. Our findings reveal that acute ZIKV infection at 4 days post-infection (4 dpi) induces significant apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the adult brain, persisting up to 28 dpi. Notably, ZIKV infection triggers apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex—key regions involved in memory—and induces early immune cell infiltration. Additionally, microglial activation occurs following infection at 7 dpi, with viral RNA detected in the brain. Bulk RNA sequencing of the hippocampus at 28 dpi further reveals the activation of inflammatory pathways, underscoring the prolonged neuroinflammatory response in the infected brain. Microglial activation is likely driven by infiltrating monocytes, as inhibiting monocyte recruitment reduced the expression of microglial activation genes. These results suggest that targeting monocyte-induced inflammatory mediators could be potential therapeutic interventions for ZIKV.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has underscored the need to understand the virus’s evolution due to its global health impact. This study employed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to analyze gene expression differences across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. We used publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with IDs GSE157103, GSE171110, GSE189039, and GSE201530, which contain RNA-Seq data extracted from white blood cells, whole blood, or PBMCs of individuals infected with the Original Wuhan variant (both hospitalized and non-hospitalized), the French variant (hospitalized), the Beta variant (hospitalized), and the Omicron variant (moderate and mild cases), along with COVID-negative controls. Our first objective was to examine differences in gene expression dynamics using Generalized Linear Models with Quasi-Likelihood F-tests and the Magnitude-Altitude Scoring (GLMQL-MAS) technique, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses. Our second objective was to employ Cross-MAS to identify a robust set of genes indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the variant and to assess their classification performance. GO and pathway analyses revealed a significant evolutionary shift in how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host. Early variants such as the Original Wuhan and French cases primarily affected pathways related to viral replication, including Eukaryotic Translation Elongation and Viral mRNA Translation. In contrast, later variants like Beta and Omicron showed a strategic shift toward modulating and evading the host immune response, engaging immune-related pathways such as Interferon Alpha/Beta signaling and Cytokine signaling in the immune system. To evaluate the classification potential of the identified genes, we tested them on held-out datasets GSE152418, PMC8202013, GSE161731, and GSE166190, which contain RNA-Seq data from whole blood or PBMCs of COVID-positive and healthy individuals. Using top-ranked genes such as IFI27, CDC20, RRM2, HJURP, and CDC45 in linear models including logistic regression and linear SVM, we achieved 97.31% accuracy, with precision and recall rates of 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. These signatures also achieved perfect classification (100% accuracy, precision, and recall) in two additional datasets: GSE294888, which includes blood-derived plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (DC2s) stimulated with Delta or Omicron variants, and GSE239595, which features Omicron-infected nasopharyngeal tissue. These findings demonstrate the potential of transcriptomic signatures for variant-agnostic COVID-19 detection and provide a foundation for flexible diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in response to SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of autoreactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ antineural T cells in the neurodegeneration that underlies irreversible clinical progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell–mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer–based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell–mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

        <tr id="T cell responses are vital for controlling viral infection in the central nervous system (CNS), but must be tightly regulated to limit tissue-damaging inflammation. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) CNS infection, an in vivo model for JCPyV-induced Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), we investigated sites of early infection, immune responses, and recruitment of T cells to the brain. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) single-cell spatial transcriptomics was applied to assess the regionality of virus infection and brain-resident cell and infiltrating leukocyte responses. MERFISH, immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry demonstrate that the ependyma is the predominant region of MuPyV CNS infection and localization of T cells, and implicated CXCR4 and CXCR6 in T cell migration to the ependyma and subventricular zone. Using CXCR6 knockout mice and a specific CXCR4 small molecule antagonist, we found that the combined impairment of CXCR6 and CXCR4 signaling resulted in elevated infiltration of T cells in the MuPyV-infected brain. This work demonstrates that CXCR4 and CXCR6 act in a nonredundant fashion to restrict T cell accumulation to the polyomavirus-infected ependyma, with important implications for ongoing efforts to use JCPyV-specific T cell adoptive immunotherapy for PML.

        <tr id="Innate immune cells appear to have an important implication in the resolution and/or the aggravation of the COVID-19 pathogenesis after infection with SARS-CoV-2. To better appreciate the role of these cells during COVID-19, changes in blood eosinophil, the neutrophil and monocyte count, and levels of surface protein markers have been reported. However, analyses at several timepoints of multiple surface markers on granulocytes and monocytes over a period of one month after a SARS-CoV-2 infection are missing. Therefore, in this study, we performed blood eosinophil, neutrophil, and monocyte phenotyping using a list of surface proteins and flow cytometry during a period of 30 days after the hospitalization of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Blood cell counts were reported at seven different timepoints over the 30-day period as well as measures of multiple mediators in serum using a targeted multiplex assay approach. Our results indicate a 95% drop in the blood eosinophil count by D1, with eosinophils displaying a phenotype defined as CD69/CD63/CD125high and CCR3/CD44low during the early phases of hospitalization. Conversely, by D7 the neutrophil count increased significantly and displayed an immature, activated, and immunosuppressive phenotype (i.e., 3% of CD10/CD16low and CD10lowCD177high, 6.7% of CD11bhighCD62Llow, and 1.6% of CD16highCD62Llow), corroborated by enhanced serum proteins that are markers of neutrophil activation. Finally, our results suggest a rapid recruitment of non-classical monocytes leaving CD163/CD64high and CD32low monocytes in circulation during the very early phase. In conclusion, our study reveals potential very early roles for eosinophils and monocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 with a likely reprogramming of eosinophils in the bone marrow. The exact roles of the pro-inflammatory neutrophils and the functions of the eosinophils and the monocytes, as well as these innate immune cell types, interplays need to be further investigated.">

Compared to young mice, Integrinβ3 (ITGB3) expression levels were higher in ECs of mid-aged mice which showed thrombosis in lungs. SARS-CoV-2 exposure increased the number of adhered platelets on the EC monolayer in vitro. Knockdown of ITGB3 in ECs decreased platelet adhesion to them. Among the molecules known as SARS-CoV-2 receptors, Kringle-containing transmembrane protein 1 contributed to ITGB3 upregulation in ECs by SARS-CoV-2. Histological analysis showed that ITGB3-positive blood vessels were frequently detected not only in infected-mid-aged mouse lungs but also in COVID-19-affected human autopsy lungs. This study suggests that the induction of ITGB3 expression in ECs is one of the mechanisms of thrombosis in severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

        <tr id="Immune evasion and suppression lead to unchecked tumor growth in glioblastoma. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been implicated in tumor progression and modulation in glioblastoma. To investigate this potential connection, CMV-associated changes in the glioblastoma immune landscape were characterized in vitro and in a murine glioblastoma model. Infection of mouse glioblastoma cells (GL261Luc2) with mCMV resulted in a short period of viral replication. MHC-I cell surface expression was reduced after mCMV infection by approximately 40% compared with non-infected tumor cells (p < 0.0001). Viral regulators of antigen presentation (vRAP) were shown to be responsible for MHC-I downregulation using a recombinant mCMV (ΔvRAP) lacking the known immune evasion genes. RNA sequencing of mCMV infected GL261Luc cells revealed 2711 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.005). Of particular interest was the downregulation of MHC-I-associated genes H2-Q1-10 and Tap1 fter CMV infection. In vivo, the mCMV immediate early gene (IE1) was detected in brains of mCMV + animals after tumor implantation and increased during tumor growth. mCMV + mice had significantly shorter survival than controls, depending on initial tumor size (P < 0.001). Tumor immune infiltrates in mCMV infection were characterized by B cell infiltrates and low levels of NK cell infiltration. Here, the landscape of immune cell infiltrates is shifted toward B cell infiltration and reduced numbers of NK cells. CMV leads to immune evasion mediated MHC-I downregulation in murine glioblastoma. Thus, CMV infection in glioblastoma may contribute to unchecked tumor growth in glioblastoma by increasing immune evasion.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a major health emergency since its emergence in late 2019. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of COVID-19, leading to severe illness, i.e. coagulopathy, multi-organ failure. FX06, a fibrin-derived peptide naturally occurring in the human body, formerly known as Bβ15-42, is a promising therapeutic candidate for endothelial complications like capillary leakage in COVID-19 and other forms of acute respiratory disorders. The aim of this project is to investigate whether FX06 can attenuate COVID-19 cytokine-triggered inflammatory processes in vitro. Methods To mimic the inflammatory status of COVID-19, a human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell line (ECs) – HULEC-5a, was treated with a cytokine cocktail comprised of ten different cytokines or chemokines at concentrations found in serum profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness, further referred to as the severe cytokine cocktail. ECs were treated with the severe cytokine cocktail for 24 h, in the absence or presence of FX06 for 2 h. Results The severe cytokine cocktail enhanced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-endothelial adhesion and monolayer transmigration. This deleterious effect was significantly reduced by FX06. FX06 was also shown to mitigate the cytotoxic activity of allogeneic CD8+ T cells, which increased upon cytokine treatment. FX06 restored continuous vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin/CD144 distribution on the EC surface and reversed morphological changes mediated by the severe cytokine cocktail, such as the elongation of F-actin stress fibers. FX06 reduced capillary-like structure formation of the severe cytokine cocktail treated-ECs, indicating FX06 down-regulated the pro-inflammatory angiogenic activity caused by the severe cytokine cocktail. Additionally, FX06 might assist in maintaining the normal barrier function of ECs by altering the surface expression of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses demonstrated that FX06 in the presence of the severe cytokine cocktail inactivated RhoGTPase, which was confirmed by western blotting that FX06 attenuated RhoA, a member of RhoGTPase, enhanced by the severe cytokine cocktail and down-regulated the expression of the phosphorylated downstream protein, ROCK1. Conclusion Overall, FX06 shows promising potential in normalizing ECs and reducing vascular leakage to protect the endothelium against the proinflammatory effect of COVID-19-triggered cytokines.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is defined by granulomas— immune aggregates that either contain or support bacterial replication. Macrophages, fundamental components of these lesions, are crucial to TB pathogenesis, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity is incompletely understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence to profile macrophages in lung tissue and granulomas from a nonhuman primate model of early TB. We identified distinct subsets, including embryonic-origin tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived alveolar and interstitial macrophages, with distinct spatial localization in granulomas. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and a subset undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accounted for the highest frequency of Mtb-infected cells. Infected cells exhibited differential expression of immune- and migration-associated genes compared to uninfected counterparts, suggesting Mtb either induces or exploits these pathways as a survival strategy. These findings highlight macrophage heterogeneity as a major driver of differential susceptibility to Mtb and provide insights relevant to future immunomodulatory strategies.">

        <tr id="Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) promote lung protection and pathogen eradication during acute lung injury. We, therefore, tested the theory that pharmacologic stabilization of HIFs dampens lung injury during SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Initial studies in murine SARS-CoV-2 models showed improved outcomes after treatment with the FDA-approved HIF stabilizer vadadustat. Subsequent studies in genetic models implicated alveolus-expressed Hif1a in mediating lung protection. Therefore, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase II trial in patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection and concomitant hypoxia (SpO2 ≤ 94%). Patients (n = 448) were randomized to oral vadadustat (900 mg/day) or placebo for up to 14 days. Safety events were similar between the 2 groups. Vadadustat treatment induced surrogate HIF target genes. The primary outcome of severe lung injury requiring high oxygen support on day 14 occurred in 43 patients in the vadadustat group and 53 patients in the placebo group (estimated probability, 13.3% vs. 16.9%). Among patients with baseline fraction of inspired oxygen of 80% or higher (n = 106), the estimated probability of the primary outcome was 12.1% (vadadustat) versus 79.1% (placebo), indicating an even greater benefit in patients with more severe baseline hypoxia. HIF1A is a likely therapeutic target during SARS-CoV-2–associated lung injury. Robust clinical trials of HIF stabilizers during pathogen-associated lung injury are warranted.">

        <tr id="Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

        <tr id="Background: Circulating degranulated platelets have been described during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated with COVID-19 complications. This study investigated the relationship between the presence of plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA (ie, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia), systemic inflammation, and platelet dysfunction in a group of patients with COVID-19. Unlike our previous publication, which focused on platelet characterization, this work explores potential determinants of platelet activation, based on a distinct subset of patients with available stored samples. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 were stratified by platelet δ-granule content using the luciferin/luciferase assay into 2 groups: normal (COVδ-norm) and low (COVδ-low). Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia (RT-qPCR), cytokines, and chemokines (Cytometric Bead Array) were quantified on plasma samples. Markers of platelet activation were measured by flow cytometry in whole blood. Results: A total of 75 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled; 57 presented normal levels of platelet δ-granule content (COVδ-norm) and 18 had low levels of platelet δ-granules (COVδ-low). Groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, comorbidities, and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia levels. Patients in the COVδ-low group showed significantly higher chemokine and cytokine levels compared to those in the COVδ-norm group, with strong correlations between IL-6, as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with platelet degranulation parameters. A similar trend, albeit less pronounced, was observed when patients were stratified based on their platelet activation phenotype. Conclusions: These findings suggest that peripheral inflammation, rather than SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, is associated with platelet dysfunction during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

To investigate the cellular tropism and infection dynamics of EV-D68, we profiled naive and EV-D68-infected human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs). Upon infection with two EV-D68 strains, US/IL/14-18952 (a B2 strain) and US/MA/18-23089 (a B3 strain), we observed distinct viral tropism and host transcriptional responses. Notably, US/IL/14-18952 showed a significant preference for neurons, while US/MA/18-23089 exhibited higher rates of infection in cycling astrocytes and OPCs. These findings provide novel insights into the host cell tropism of EV-D68 in the spinal cord, offering insight into the potential mechanisms underlying AFM pathogenesis. Understanding the dynamics of infection at single-cell resolution will inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the neurological impact of enteroviral infections.">

Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

        <tr id="Background Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a significant threat to human health. The virus causes potentially fatal disease of the central nervous system (CNS), for which no treatments are available. TBEV infected individuals display a wide spectrum of neuronal disease, the determinants of which are undefined. Changes to host metabolism and virus-induced immunity have been postulated to contribute to the neuronal damage observed in infected individuals. In this study, we evaluated the cytokine, chemokine, and metabolic alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic patients infected with TBEV presenting with meningitis or encephalitis. Our aim was to investigate the host immune and metabolic responses associated with specific TBEV infectious outcomes. Methods CSF samples of patients with meningitis (n = 27) or encephalitis (n = 25) were obtained upon consent from individuals hospitalised with confirmed TBEV infection in Brno. CSF from uninfected control patients was also collected for comparison (n = 12). A multiplex bead-based system was used to measure the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Untargeted metabolomics followed by bioinformatics and integrative omics were used to profile the levels of metabolites in the CSF. Human motor neurons (hMNs) were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV-Hypr strain to profile the role(s) of identified metabolites during the virus lifecycle. Virus infection was quantified via plaque assay. Results Significant differences in proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-α2, TSLP, IL-1α, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-15, and IL-18) and chemokines (IL-8, CCL20, and CXCL11) were detected between neurological-TBEV and control patients. A total of 32 CSF metabolites differed in TBE patients with meningitis and encephalitis. CSF S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP1) and Phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) levels were 2.4-fold (range ≥ 2.3-≥3.2) higher in encephalitis patients compared to the meningitis group. CSF urocanic acid levels were significantly lower in patients with encephalitis compared to those with meningitis (p = 0.012209). Follow-up analyses showed fluctuations in the levels of O-phosphoethanolamine, succinic acid, and L-proline in the encephalitis group, and pyruvic acid in the meningitis group. TBEV-infection of hMNs increased the production of SAM, FBP1 and PEP in a time-dependent manner. Depletion of the metabolites with characterised pharmacological inhibitors led to a concentration-dependent attenuation of virus growth, validating the identified changes as key mediators of TBEV infection. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the neurological disease outcome of TBEV infection is associated with specific and dynamic metabolic signatures in the cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a new in vitro model for in-depth studies of TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis, in which the depletion of identified metabolites limits virus infection. Collectively, this reveals new biomarkers that can differentiate and predict TBEV-associated neurological disease. Additionally, we have identified novel therapeutic targets with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and deepen our understanding of TBEV pathogenesis.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Growing evidence links immune dysfunction, notably impaired IFNγ production, to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but understanding of the immune phenotype in CPA patients remains limited. Methods To investigate this, we recruited 25 CPA patients and 25 controls with bronchiectasis, isolating immune cells from peripheral blood for detailed flow cytometric phenotyping at resting state and after ex vivo stimulation with the TLR2/Dectin-1 agonist Zymosan. Results CPA patients exhibited pronounced neutrophilia and a reduced frequency of conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets at baseline compared to bronchiectasis controls. Post-stimulation, DC and monocyte subsets in CPA patients showed significantly lower expression of activation markers. Notably, cDC1s displayed reduced IL-12p40, TNFα, and CD86 expression. CPA patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had significantly higher frequencies of activated cDC1s. Machine learning analysis validated these immunological parameters as predictive of CPA status. Conclusion Our findings suggest that immune dysfunction in CPA involves DC and monocyte impairments, potentially contributing to IFNγ deficiency through reduced IL-12 production and co-stimulatory capacity in cDC1s. These results also hint at the presence of innate immune memory in CPA patients with prior TB. Our study advances understanding of the immune dysfunction underlying CPA.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge the world with a major public health problem, long COVID (LC), which is estimated to affect over 400 million people worldwide. Many unknowns remain regarding the mechanisms involved in LC. We investigated the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and IFN-γ responses on the development of LC and its various phenotypes. We studied a cohort of 137 convalescents following predominantly mild COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave (2020) and up to one-year post-infection. We found 45% of LC cases that were associated with a greater number and duration of acute-phase symptoms. Cardiovascular and/or gastrointestinal symptoms in the acute phase were associated to protection against LC development, while pulmonary, otorhinolaryngological, musculoskeletal and other symptoms were associated with increased risk of LC development. Regarding LC phenotypes, we observed risk associations and potentially deleterious effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for LC symptoms classified as general or other. In contrast, for vital organ-related LC symptoms, we found only protective associations, particularly for cardiovascular symptoms, which indeed had a low prevalence in LC (16%). Collectively, our data suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies play a protective role against vital organ-related LC symptoms, especially cardiovascular symptoms, but are insufficient in preventing or limiting other highly prevalent LC symptoms, such as neurological, psychiatric and pulmonary.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced excessive inflammatory response is a key contributor to pathology in respiratory viral infections. However, the underlying mechanisms by which viral infection provokes intense inflammatory reaction and how sustained inflammation leads to tissue damage are not fully understood. Using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as an example, our research demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce PANoptosis in bystander cells, contributing to the persistence of inflammatory responses. Specifically, the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in infected cells leads to the secretion of 2'3'cGMP-AMP, TNF-α, and IFN-β. These molecules activate STING-induced autophagy-mediated ADAR1 degradation, resulting in the accumulation of Z-nucleic acid, which subsequently triggers ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis in bystander cells. Additionally, inhibiting the cGAS pathway or knocking out STING effectively reduces PANoptosis and alleviates the pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus infection in mouse models. Overall, our findings reveal the unexpected role of PANoptosis in bystander cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection as a mechanism driving pathological damage and persistent inflammatory responses. Targeting this process may offer a promising strategy to mitigate tissue damage in COVID-19 as well as other viral infections and inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes are central mediators of neuroinflammation in several neurodegenerative diseases. Their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. This study aimed to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes were cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a microfluidic coculture platform. This platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of distinct microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 h. Glial activation and interactions were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. LPS stimulation of cocultures induced lower secretion of several inflammatory mediators, suggesting dampening of microglial inflammatory responses when cocultured with astrocytes. Notably, inflammatory interaction between glial cells was demonstrated by increased level of IL-10 after TNF-α/IL-1β stimulation in cocultures compared with monocultures. The microfluidic coculture platform enabled the parallel study of microglial migration, glial activation and phagocytic function, thereby facilitating the investigation of glial responses within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Furthermore, glial inflammatory responses and interactions were demonstrated in the controlled microenvironments of the microfluidic coculture platform. The inflammatory coculture environment was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate inflammatory interaction between iPSC-derived microglia and astrocytes via reciprocal molecular signaling. Importantly, the microfluidic coculture platform established in this study provides a more functional and advanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.

        <tr id="COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), stands as one of the most severe pandemics the world has ever faced in recent times. SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of symptoms, varying from severe manifestations to mild cases and even asymptomatic carriers. This diversity stems from a multitude of factors, including genetic predisposition, viral variants, and immune status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system engages pattern recognition receptors, setting off a series of intricate signalling cascades. These cascades culminate in the activation of innate immune responses, including induction of type I and type III interferons. The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose challenges to the innate immune system defense. Therefore, investigating the innate immune response is crucial for effectively combating SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophoshate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, a critical innate immune mechanism, represents a promising target for intervention at multiple stages to reduce the severity and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review explores innate immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and other immune responses critical for SARS-CoV-2 defence. As part of the therapeutic approach, we extend our review to highlight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as emerging and effective therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 by targeting different stages of the innate immune system. A diverse range of mAbs has been explored to address specific targets within the innate immune pathways. A deep understanding of innate immunity and targeted monoclonal therapeutics will be instrumental in combating viruses and their variants, laying the foundation for enhanced treatment and therapeutic strategies.">

Functional significance of peripheral memory T cells in individuals recovered from COVID-19 (COVID-19+) is beginning to be appreciated; however, the role of lung tissue-resident memory (lung TRM) T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still being investigated. This is, in part, due to the lack of preclinical tissue models available to follow the convalescence period. Methods Here, we utilize a perfused three-dimensional (3D) human lung-tissue model and show pre-existing local T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 proteins in lung tissues. Results We report ex vivo maintenance of functional multi-specific IFN-γ-secreting lung TRM T cells in COVID-19+ and their induction in lung tissues of vaccinated COVID-19+ subjects. Importantly, we identify SARS-CoV-2 peptide-responding memory B cells and IgA+ plasma cells in ex vivo cultured lung tissues of COVID-19+. Furthermore, lung tissue IgA levels were increased in COVID-19+ and responded to peptide stimulation.

        <tr id="In the last 2 years, there has been an increasing concern that SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a marker of undiagnosed cancers. A potential connection between COVID-19/long COVID and malignant transformation/cancer progression was reported in a number of studies. It is, however, unclear if the virus itself can cause malignant transformation or if it has a potential to support malignant processes in human body. We analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs collected from individuals infected with Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and conducted in vitro studies using BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells. Here we report that Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein induce activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex in infected cells. This effect is achieved through conversion of cellular 2-oxoglutarate into 2-hydroxy-glutarate, which most likely blocks the activity of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylation. As such, it leads to activation of HIF-1, which triggers production of transforming growth factor–β type 1 (TGF-β). TGF-β induces expression of immune checkpoint proteins, such as galectin-9, programmed death-ligand 1, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme, which is involved in production of immunosuppressive amino acid called L-kynurenine. These immune checkpoint pathways were capable of suppressing both helper and cytotoxic activities of T lymphocytes and, as such, could potentially support malignant processes in infected tissues.">

        <tr id="The autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc) presents with multiple organ manifestations that often complicate management strategies. To explore variations in immune cell subsets and their link to clinical heterogeneity, here we perform single-cell profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 SSc patients who never received immunosuppressive therapy. We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression. Thus, our single-cell analysis reveals distinct immune cell abnormalities associated with clinical organ manifestations, providing insights into tailored treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background In late 2022, Beijing, China saw a large-scale BF.7 Omicron variant breakthrough infection. However, the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on elderly breakthrough-infected patients’ antibodies and immune cells response was unclear. Methods We recruited 329 inpatients over 65 with BF.7 breakthrough infections. We analyzed the link between vaccination and survival in 67 sampled patients, investigating changes in antibody levels, cytokine profiles, as well as immune phenotypes. Results Experiments revealed that while vaccination could raise antibody levels in the elderly, it showed no significant neutralizing activity against the emerging COVID-19 variant XBB. Flow cytometry showed vaccination increased the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Moreover, we found that elevated frequencies of CD4+ Tsens cells were associated with reduced antigen-specific CD4+ T cell activation, diminished IL-2 production, and lower proportions of Tfh cells, which ultimately leading to impaired neutralizing antibody production, particularly against new emerging variants. Conclusions We found the immunological efficacy of inactivated vaccines in elderly patients is influenced by the proportion of CD4+ senescent T cells. Future elderly vaccination strategies need optimization in dose number and timing, and future vaccine design should aim to minimize the generation of CD4+ senescent T cells.

        <tr id="Severe viral infections can precipitate acute lung injury, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. While NETosis serves as an important defense mechanism against pathogens and viruses, its excessive or dysregulated activation may contribute to pulmonary damage. In this study, elevated levels of NETosis were detected in the peripheral blood of patients with viral pneumonia. To further investigate the relationship between NETosis and virus-induced acute lung injury, a murine model was established using intratracheal administration of poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA that mimics viral infection. NETosis biomarkers were assessed in both patients and poly(I:C)-stimulated mice. In addition, we examined the role of the Hippo signaling pathway and its downstream mediators, including inflammatory factors and chemokines. Enhanced NETosis and activation of the Hippo pathway were observed in the lungs of poly(I:C)-treated mice, along with elevated levels of IL-1β in isolated macrophages. These effects were mitigated by Hippo pathway inhibitors. Co-culture experiments confirmed that IL-1β promotes NETosis, while NLRP3, acting downstream of the Hippo pathway, was responsible for IL-1β secretion. Patients with viral pneumonia showed increased NLRP3 and IL-1β expression in monocyte-derived macrophages compared to healthy controls. Overall, our findings indicate that activation of the Hippo pathway in macrophages during poly(I:C) exposure upregulates NLRP3 and IL-1β expression, thereby promoting NETosis and exacerbating virus-induced lung injury. This study highlights a potential therapeutic target to reduce lung damage caused by viral infections.">

        <tr id="Different functional T lymphocytes play important roles in the progression of IAV infection, including proliferation, recruitment, and effector activity. However, the immune changes of T cells during IAV infection are unclear, and the related targets are still to be explored. In this study, we used a multi-omics approach combining transcriptome and single-cell transcriptome analysis to identify TXN as a key target gene and elucidate its close association with T-cell proliferation. From these data, we identified 10 key differential genes through a combination of differential analysis, WGCNA, and Friends analysis and further identified that only TXN and S100A6 co-existed in the highly variable genes of proliferative T cells. Because TXN exhibits highly specific high expression in proliferative T cells, we focused on its related research and ultimately identified it as a target gene for IAV infection. Reports have suggested that simultaneous inhibition of the GSH and TXN pathways can effectively trigger cell death. This proves our hypothesis about a new direction of T cell death in IAV infection. Additionally, we found that T cell development after IAV infection was regulated and altered, but this study did not clearly explain whether it was negative regulation. In summary, we have identified TXN as a target gene involved in T cell proliferation during IAV infection, and we suggest that its expression may be associated with non-apoptotic forms of T cell death.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toxoplasma gondii is a foodborne intracellular parasite that chronically infects the brain. Although T. gondii infection elicits a protective immune response, the nature of the monocyte response in the immediate vicinity of parasites during initial brain infection is not well understood. By infecting mice with T. gondii and comparing areas of the brain containing or not containing parasites, we found an increase in CCR2+ monocytes, IBA1+ myeloid cells, GFAP+ astrocytes, and CD68+ signal near parasites in the brain, indicating immune cell infiltration and phagolysosomal activation in response to the infection. CCR2+CD68+ monocytes were specifically increased near tachyzoites with minimal localization of these cells near cysts in the brain. This monocyte response was also detected near parasite-interacted cells, identified using T. gondii parasites that inject Cre recombinase into “interacted” cells of Ai6 CCR2RFP/+ mice, enabling us to track these events in vivo. The chemokine CCL2 and its transcription factor NF-κB were also upregulated surrounding parasites in the brain; however, the T. gondii effector protein GRA15, which sustains NF-κB activation in infected cells, was not required for CCL2 production, NF-κB activation, or myeloid cell recruitment to parasites in the brain. In contrast, active T. gondii replication played a more significant role, as CCR2+ monocytes were recruited to replication-competent but not replication-deficient T. gondii delivered via intracranial injection into mice. These findings provide novel insights into the drivers of immune cell mobilization and activation in the brain during initial T. gondii central nervous system infection and highlight the importance of parasite replication in this process. IMPORTANCE Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-infecting parasite, and the mobilization of peripheral immune cells to the brain is critical for controlling T. gondii infection. However, the initial events driving these cells to sites of T. gondii infection in the brain are poorly understood. We show that peripheral myeloid immune cell recruitment and activation are specific to areas of the brain containing actively replicating parasites, which are capable of lysing host cells. This local immune response is characterized by focal chemokine production, myeloid cell recruitment, and the activation of phagolysosomal pathways. These highly localized host responses were independent of the parasite effector protein that induces NF-κB activation within infected cells, GRA15. However, the localized monocyte recruitment was dependent on live parasites and active parasite replication. This research highlights the importance of host cell sensing of parasite replication in the brain for immune control of T. gondii infection.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (PE), a hypertensive disorder, but the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify ORF3a, a SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein, as a key factor in placental dysfunction, driving autophagy dysregulation, trophoblast maturation impairment, protein aggregation and placental barrier disruption–processes linked to PE. We detect ORF3a in placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 along with increased protein aggregation and disrupted tight junctions in ORF3a + regions. In placental cell lines, ORF3a impairs syncytiotrophoblast maturation and induces protein aggregation. Mechanistically, ORF3a binds to ZO-1 via its PDZ-binding motif (SVPL), and deletion of this domain from ORF3a abrogates its effect on trophoblast barrier integrity. In human trophoblast cells engineered with an LC3-GFP-mCherry reporter, ORF3a induces autophagosome accumulation, and shifts autophagy toward a secretory pathway with elevated levels of CD63 + extracellular vesicles and disrupted ZO-1 localization, all of which are recapitulated by live infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. These ORF3a-dependent changes are fully recapitulated in 3D stem-cell-derived trophoblast organoids (SC-TOs). Together, our findings define a molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection compromises placental syncytial integrity. Targeting ORF3a may provide a therapeutic strategy to mitigate PE-like placental dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2–infected pregnancies.">

        <tr id="Introduction The immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in the context of long COVID, remain critical areas of study. Understanding these responses is essential for addressing the long-term health impacts of COVID-19. Recent research also highlights the pivotal role of proteases in modulating immune responses and contributing to disease severity, making them a key focus of our analysis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 72 convalescent COVID-19 patients, assessing recovery at three key time points: immediately post-discharge, one month later, and three months post-infection. Additionally, a subset of 15 patients was followed up two years post-COVID-19. Clinical parameters, including demographics, comorbidities, treatment modalities, and COVID-19 severity, were evaluated. Using CyTOF technology, we characterized over 30 immune cell subsets, including granulocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. We also performed multiplexed analyses of blood samples to profile cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and COVID-19-related proteins. Results Our comprehensive approach revealed significant changes in the immune system over time, highlighting the role of specific immune cells and proteases in the recovery process. Key findings include a decreasing deregulatory effect on immune responses exerted by subsequent SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Delta, and Omicron. Conclusion This study provides an in-depth understanding of the molecular dynamics of immune recovery following COVID-19. By integrating clinical profiling, plasma multiplex analysis, antibody profiling, mass cytometry immunophenotyping, in vitro PBMC stimulation, and the role of proteases, we offer valuable insights into the complex interplay of immune, inflammatory, and protease-mediated responses in individuals recovering from COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection varies greatly, with many patients requiring intensive care due to complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome, reduced respiratory system compliance, and altered iron metabolism, which can be mistaken for worsening Influenza A infection. This highlights the need to study the humoral immune response to better understand the pathophysiology of viral respiratory infections and improve treatments and diagnostics. This study analyzed autoantibody and acute-phase reactant profiles in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A using customized protein microarrays for sensitive and reproducible results. The findings revealed a significant increase in autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients, including those targeting calcitonin-related polypeptides, hepatocyte growth factor, or interleukin 8, compared to Influenza A patients, who showed elevated levels of selectin E and surfactant protein D. Additionally, most acute-phase reactants were higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The serological profile showed that the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain induced both IgM and IgG responses to all viral proteins, while other strains triggered an IgG response only at a later stage. Multiomics factor analysis identified key factors driving variation in COVID-19's heterogeneous disease presentation.

        <tr id="Chronic migraine (CM) is a debilitating neurological disorder, yet the glial-specific mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC)—a critical hub for craniofacial pain processing—remain poorly understood. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to resolve cell-type-specific transcriptional landscapes in a nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced CM rat model, with a particular focus on microglia and astrocytes. We identified 19 transcriptional clusters representing nine major cell types, among which reactive microglia (NTG-Mic) and astrocytes (NTG-Asts) were markedly expanded. The NTG-Mic displayed a glycolysis-dominant, complement-enriched state, whereas the NTG-Asts exhibited concurrent activation of amino acid transport and cytokine signaling pathways. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed bifurcated glial activation paths, with NTG driving both cell types toward terminal reactive states. Intercellular communication inference uncovered suppressed homeostatic interactions (e.g., CSF1-CSF1R) alongside enhanced proinflammatory signaling (e.g., FGF1-FGFR2, PTN-SDC4), particularly affecting neuron–glia and glia–glia crosstalk. Together, these findings define a high-resolution atlas of glial reprogramming in CM, implicating state-specific metabolic–immune transitions and dysregulated glial communication as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Objectives: Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019. It is unclear whether anti-viral cellular and humoral immunity is impacted in patients with ILD in the presence of immune disorders and immunosuppressive therapy. This results in poor control of viral infections following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to highlight the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We compared viral clearance, antibody levels, and T-cell immune response between healthy controls and patients with connective tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) or interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Results: Patients with ILD exhibited a higher viral load than the control group (1.58 × 106 vs. 2.37 × 103 copies/mL, p = 0.018), as well as a significantly lower level of neutralizing antibodies against the wild-type (WT) virus (7.01 vs. 625.6, p < 0.0001) and Omicron BA.5 (7.19 vs. 128.4, p < 0.001). Similarly, a lower virus-specific T-cell (VST) immune response was observed 14 days post-symptom onset in the ILD group (CD4+ VSTs: 0.018 vs. 0.082, p = 0.005; CD8+ VSTs: 0.0008 vs. 0.047, p = 0.004). The ILD group had no other heightened inflammatory biomarkers compared with the control group. Conclusions: Our study provides novel evidence of the underlying interaction between virus clearance and host immune status and sheds light on the clinical management of patients with ILD with regard to the adjustment of anti-inflammatory therapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous virus with a global prevalence of 90%, but infection typically has minimal clinical impact in immunocompetent individuals. Consequently, most people are neither tested nor treated for HCMV. However, HCMV seropositivity is associated with higher hospitalization rates following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to seronegative individuals, suggesting that viral reactivation may exacerbate severity of clinical symptoms. To investigate this, rhesus macaques naturally infected with rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and monitored. Following inoculation, RhCMV viral loads in plasma increased from baseline, indicating reactivation. Within tissues, the lungs and ileum expressed immediate early protein-1 (IE1), a marker of active RhCMV infection. Additionally, elevated frequencies of circulating activated CD69+ memory T cells at day 3 suggested a recall response to a previously encountered pathogen. These findings demonstrate RhCMV reactivation and associated immune activation following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the rhesus macaque/RhCMV model as a valuable tool to elucidate the role of HCMV in SARS-CoV2 disease in immunocompetent hosts.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological alterations, ranging from headache and dizziness to severe encephalopathy and inflammatory neurological diseases (IND), and neuropathological findings suggest immune-mediated processes. Therefore, we sought to characterize profiles of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and markers of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis in COVID-19 patients with neurological alterations to identify key factors and mechanisms underlying CNS disturbances in COVID-19. The study included a case series of 52 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations, which were categorized into three groups: isolated refractory headache (n = 14), encephalopathy (n = 24), and IND (n = 14). Individuals with non-inflammatory, non-infectious neurological conditions (n = 9) were included as negative controls. Paired CSF and serum samples were assessed for 56 biomarkers. Regardless of the neurological condition, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated CSF levels of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-15, IL-25, IFN-α2, CCL7, CCL11, and GM-CSF. Patients with encephalopathy and IND also showed increased IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, neopterin, IL-7, CXCL8, CXCL9, TGF-α, EGF, sTREM-2, and HMGB1, consistent with a CNS cytokine storm. In contrast, individuals with isolated refractory headache showed a modest inflammatory profile, compatible with the limited CNS involvement. COVID-19 patients showed elevated serum IL-13, IL-18, TNF-α, VILIP-1, TGF-α, and VEGF levels, indicating systemic inflammation and potential blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. β-NGF was increased in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, suggesting the activation of neuroprotective responses during patient recovery. Functional protein network analysis showed a significant enrichment of interactions between factors altered in the CSF of patients with encephalopathy and IND, many of them related to processes of neuroinflammation and microglial functions, and leukocyte chemotaxis, activation and proliferation. These findings support a model in which both systemic immune activation and localized neuroinflammation contribute to the diversity of neurological outcomes observed in COVID-19, and dysregulated cytokine production, glial activation, inflammasome activity and BBB disturbances represent key factors in neuro-COVID-19 pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease linked with deregulated immune responses, leading to hyperinflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis, often with fatal outcomes. Neutrophils play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with elevated peripheral blood neutrophil counts correlating with disease severity. Despite extensive research, the molecular processes associated with neutrophil hyperactivation in COVID-19 remain elusive. Methods To investigate the molecular signatures underlying neutrophil-driven pathology, we conducted transcriptome analysis in neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients versus healthy individuals. To evaluate the specificity of identified neutrophil signatures in COVID-19, we extended our transcriptomic analysis to neutrophils from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a non-infectious fibrotic lung disease. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining was performed on lung biopsy specimens from IPF patients to validate transcriptomic findings at the tissue level. Results Our analysis revealed significant transcriptional changes in COVID-19 neutrophils, particularly in pathways involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and antiviral responses. Additionally, pathways associated with autophagy and chromatin remodeling were upregulated, while translation-related processes were suppressed, indicating an increased predisposition for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release. This neutrophil transcriptional signature in COVID-19 appears to be associated with the previously reported deregulation of the Activin/Follistatin system in the periphery. Notably, a comparative transcriptomic analysis with neutrophils isolated from IPF patients revealed the induction of substantially overlapping inflammatory processes, suggesting common deregulated responses in COVID-19 and IPF. Consistently, significant NET formation, a hallmark of COVID-19-related inflammation, was observed within lung biopsies from IPF patients. Conclusion By delineating both shared and disease-specific molecular pathways, our findings validate the critical role of neutrophils in COVID-19 and IPF pathophysiology, highlighting their involvement in balancing the inflammatory response across diverse lung diseases.

        <tr id="Rasmussen Encephalitis (RE) is a chronic, unilateral epileptic disorder mostly found in children. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by T lymphocyte infiltration targeting neurons and leading to microglia activation, astrogliosis, and cortical degeneration. Within a patient’s brain, distinct pathological stages are found that offer a unique opportunity to study T cell dynamics in situ. Using quantitative multiplex fluorescence imaging, we analyzed CD103+ and CD69+ Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) across different disease stages. This analysis revealed that TRM were more abundant in the parenchyma than in the perivascular space, suggesting that their differentiation occurs locally after antigen encounter. Further, part of the TRM expressed Granzyme-B (GrB) and frequently were attached to neurons, suggesting that they are actively involved in neuronal destruction. While TRM showed a stage-dependent increase in older lesions, the proportions of these cells did not correlate with disease duration, indicating that their accumulation may be more dependent on the local environment in the lesion than on the length of the disease. In addition, we found that T cells using the γδ T cell receptor comprised up to 66%. Like CD8+ T cells, the γδ T cells could develop a TRM phenotype and, while expressing GrB+ granules, they were seen attached to neurons, suggesting that they are involved in neuronal destruction. Finally, analysis of exhaustion- and TRM-associated immune checkpoint control markers PD-1 and LAG-3 revealed a significant stage-dependent increase in PD-1 expression in the oldest lesions. In contrast, LAG-3 expression did not show any stage-specific pattern, pointing towards a distinct regulatory mechanism. The study demonstrates a dynamic and one-way T cell response throughout the course of RE at a given spot in the CNS: from the establishment of T cell residence after entry into the CNS, the killing of neurons, and eventually T cell exhaustion. It further suggests an important role of γδ T-cells in the propagation of disease and lesions.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a critical global health threat, with DENV-2 being the most virulent serotype capable of causing lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a severe complication characterized by plasma leakage and hemorrhagic manifestations. While the search for viral receptors and immunocompetent animal models has persisted since the first recorded outbreak in 1779, significant gaps remain. Here, we establish the first immunocompetent murine model of DHF with intact innate/adaptive immunity by generating hTim4-transgenic C57BL/6J mice. This model recapitulates fatal DHF complications seen in humans, including systemic hemorrhage, dengue encephalitis and intestinal ischemia/gangrene. Integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics analysis of hemorrhagic gut lesions demonstrated that DENV-2 infection induces Syk protein overexpression, leading to enhanced Th2 cytokine secretion and impaired hemostatic regulation. This cascade enhances vascular permeability, promotes plasma leakage, and drives multiorgan hemorrhage, a mechanism corroborated by parallel analyses of human DHF tissues. Critically, Th2-biased cytokine storm mirrors clinical findings in severe human dengue cases. Our work not only identifies hTim4 as a functional DENV-2 receptor but also provides a mechanistically grounded platform for DHF pathogenesis studies, bridging critical gaps between preclinical models and human immunopathology.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="The ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants highlights the importance of monitoring immune responses to guide vaccination strategies. Although neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have garnered increasing attention, T-cells are crucial for conferring long-lasting immunity, especially their resilience against viral mutations. However, assessing T-cell responses clinically has been hindered by cost and complexity. In this study, we recruited a cohort of 134 healthy adults, who had been immunized with three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. Cellular immunity elicited by a comprehensive array of overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the virus’s structural proteins was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Additionally, a dataset including demographic information, routine blood indices, and immune cell indicators comprising 32 variables was collected. Multivariate analysis revealed age and days post-vaccination as key factors influencing the strength of the T-cell response. Importantly, random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were employed, along with 8 easily accessible indicators to formulate predictive models for the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Besides, these models demonstrated substantial accuracy (r > 0.9) in both the training and testing sets. Our findings offer an efficient and economical methodology for evaluating the T-cell reactions in healthy adults following inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which is visualizable and easy to use, providing a novel strategy for assessing cellular immunity after vaccination.

        <tr id="Background The airway epithelium represents the first line of defense of the lungs, functioning both as a physical barrier as well as an active immune modulator. However, in the last years, pneumonia caused by the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii have become difficult to treat due to the increase of the number of extensively drug resistant strains. In this study, we report for the first time the use of an ex vivo air–liquid interface (ALI) model of differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells to unravel the early response to A. baumannii infection. Methods Epithelial integrity, tissue architecture, and goblet cell function were assessed through FITC-dextran permeability assays, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and indirect immunofluorescence. Transcriptomic profiling was performed to characterize host gene expression changes. Results Initial tissue damage began as early as at 4 h post-infection (hpi); at 24 hpi, goblet cell hypertrophy, reduced mucin secretion, and compromised epithelial integrity were highly evident. Transcriptomic data at 4 hpi revealed 668 differentially expressed genes (441 upregulated, 227 downregulated), mainly involved in a strong pro-inflammatory response and characterized by IL-8/CCL20-driven neutrophil recruitment and type 2 cytokine activation (IL-4, IL-13). Noteworthy, genes related to cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, and extracellular matrix remodeling were significantly altered, suggesting a bacterial mechanism to enhanced tissue dissemination. The PI3K-Akt survival pathway was inhibited, with downregulation of PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 genes, implying the induction of apoptosis/cell death and epithelial damage. Our findings are in agreement with previous in vivo studies, further strengthening the value of our ALI model in mimicking the early infection response of bronchial cells to A. baumannii infection. Conclusion Our data highlight the early molecular mechanisms underlying A. baumannii pathogenesis and open new avenues for future investigations for therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="The blood vessel network is heavily impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection. How SARS-CoV-2 contributes to vascular inflammation and whether epithelio-endothelial cross-talk is involved remain unclear. We investigated in detail the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the vasculature using 2D and 3D vesseloid in vitro models. We first assessed whether SARS-CoV-2 is able to directly infect endothelial cells. In the absence of ACE2 in endothelial cells, no productive infection was detected. Low uptake of viral particles by ACE2-overexpressing endothelial cells was observed without efficient viral production. Thus, the indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection may involve epithelio-endothelial cell cross-talk. After infection of the epithelial cells, a significant inflammatory response was detected in the endothelial cells. CXCL10 was the most highly expressed proinflammatory cytokine involved in this intercellular communication, and its function was subsequently explored. Finally, the clinical relevance of our findings was confirmed in two patient cohorts.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection has been associated with severe cardiovascular complications. However, the role of epitranscriptional modulation involved in SARS-CoV-2-infected myocarditis is still unclear. Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2), a methylcytosine dioxygenase, plays key roles in DNA demethylation during viral infection and host–virus interactions. Using human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a platform, our data revealed the epitranscriptomic role of TET2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, our RNA sequencing analysis revealed the alterations of the messenger-RNA-expression profiles of epitranscriptomic regulators, including TET2, in hiPSC-CMs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, silencing TET2 markedly reduced both the messenger RNA and protein levels of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, leading to attenuated viral replication in infected hiPSC-CMs. Furthermore, RNA dot-blotting analysis revealed that TET2 knockdown suppressed the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in SARS-CoV-2-infected hiPSC-CMs. To further explore the therapeutic relevance of TET2 inhibition in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, we screened and compared 3 structurally distinct TET2 enzymatic inhibitors: Bobcat339, TETi76, and TFMB-2HG. Among these, Bobcat339 demonstrated the most potent antiviral effect, markedly suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication and N-protein expression. Molecular docking analysis revealed that Bobcat339 exhibited a high binding affinity for multiple viral targets, including nsp16, RdRp, and N protein, indicating a multitarget mechanism of action. In addition, our data demonstrated that treatment with Bobcat339 can suppress SARS-CoV-2 infectious activity and N-protein expression in infected hiPSC-CMs. Together, our findings highlight the regulatory role of TET2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify Bobcat339 as a promising therapeutic compound. Understanding TET2-driven epitranscriptomics and the functions of TET-targeting inhibitors may provide a novel strategy for mitigating viral infection in SARS-CoV-2-induced cardiomyopathy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT At the COVID-19 pandemic onset, convalescent plasma, collected from patients recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, emerged as a potential treatment option, but the effect on the patient immune response was unclear. To determine treatment effect on the infection antibody response, plasma samples were collected through 90 days from 104 SARS-CoV-2-infected participants after receiving CCP or control plasma, as part of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled early treatment trial. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was used to quantify binding IgG, IgA, and IgM to nucleocapsid (N) protein and IgG to the USA-WA1/2020 spike (S) protein. Avidity assessed antibody maturation. CCP transfusion boosted post-transfusion plasma levels of N-specific IgG, but not IgA or IgM and had a lesser effect on S-specific IgG. Over the first 2 weeks, both trial arm groups generated IgM, IgA, and IgG to N and IgG to S with comparable levels at 14–90 days after transfusion. Levels of IgM and IgA subsequently declined, while IgG was maintained through day 90 for both interventions. Avidity of N-specific IgG increased steadily over the 3-month follow-up in both groups, but S-specific IgG avidity improved only for those in the CCP group. Improved antibody titer correlated with improved avidity over time in both groups. Antibody levels and avidity between early ves late transfusion from symptom onset by trial arm intervention were also similar. In summary, CCP administration had no negative effects on the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and was associated with qualitatively improved antibodies with higher avidity. IMPORTANCE Monoclonal antibody infusion prevented COVID-19 hospitalizations. However, the massive monoclonal antibody dose, near 7% of total circulating antibodies, has been shown to decrease patient generation of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and lower responses to vaccination, possibly by decreasing generation of high avidity neutralization epitopes near the monoclonal binding epitope. We characterized diverse antibody population quality and quantity among intervention groups in the polyclonal COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) randomized control trial, effective in reducing hospitalizations by more than 50% in all participants and 80% in those receiving transfusions with symptom onset before 5 days. Importantly, we observed a greater anti-nucleocapsid compared to anti-Spike antibody level immediately after transfusion. CCP compared to controls did not alter IgG, IgA, or IgM to nucleocapsid or IgG-spike. CCP was associated with greater IgG-nucleocapsid and, to a lesser extent, IgG-spike avidity maturation over follow-up compared to control. CCP transfusions lacked negative effects on antibody levels and avidity. Monoclonal antibody infusion prevented COVID-19 hospitalizations.

        <tr id="Background Respiratory microbiome alterations, coinfections, and virus intrahost evolution are of great interest in persistently viable SARS-CoV-2 infections in the context of antiviral treatment and immune response. However, samples before, during, and after infection are seldom available to researchers. Therefore, there has been a significant lack of opportunities to comprehensively study microbiota homeostasis, coinfections, and virus intra-host evolution on the consensus and minor variants scale in response to antiviral treatments and patient immune response. Case presentation A 63-year-old female patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma received multiple treatments for SARS-CoV-2 that remained active 169 days. Together, 32 respiratory and 19 serum samples were collected before, during, and after (− 398 to 233 days) COVID-19. Subsets were selected for virus viability testing by culture (20) and subgenomic (sg) RNA (20) measurement, intra-host evolution assessment (18), microbiome composition analysis (28), and coinfection identification (11). IgA/IgG and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured 19 times throughout the infection. SARSCoV-2 lineage XBB.1.16.11 persisted and remained viable until 116 days post infection (PI) regardless of treatments. No sgRNA marker tested was suitable for virus viability prediction. IgG/IgA antibodies first appeared after 38 days, but the virus persisted regardless of multiple plasma treatments before neutralizing antibodies appeared (100 days PI) and finally cleared the virus 116 days PI. Consensus-level mutations fluctuated around 102.7 ± 4.0, and minor variants increased from six to 61 with a mutation rate of 4.9 × 10−3 per site per year, with the highest average number of mutations per gene length in S and E (0.013) with surges after every antiviral treatment. The transversion/transition ratio increased from 0.50 (day 0) to 0.57 (day 24) with a steady decrease to 0.48 (day 147). Mutational signature analysis showed dominance of C > T substitutions consistent with APOBEC antiviral enzyme activity. Upper respiratory microbiota showed three distinct profiles with varying α-/β-diversity and an association of Staphylococcus spp. with COVID-19. Conclusions These findings further elucidate the dynamics of intra-host viral evolution and complexities of virus clearance in individuals with hematological malignancies and highlight the impact of antiviral treatments on the potential of virus variants emergence in longitudinally infectious patients due to delayed immune response.

Neurological symptoms associated with long COVID include anxiety, depression, and memory impairment. However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Using golden hamsters as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persistently infect the brain, as viral RNA and replicative virus are detected in the brainstem 80 days after the initial infection. Infected hamsters exhibit a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, characterized by overexpression of innate immunity genes, and altered expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, in energy metabolism, and in proteostasis. These infected animals exhibit persistent depression-like behavior, impaired short-term memory, and late-onset signs of anxiety. Finally, we provide evidence that viral and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, contributing to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.">

        <tr id="Both bacterial and viral infections can trigger an overwhelming host response, leading to immunopathology and organ dysfunction. Multiple studies have reported dysregulated myeloid cell states in patients with bacterial sepsis or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their relevance to viral infections other than COVID-19, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a multi-cohort analysis of single cell and bulk transcriptomic data from 1845 patients across 25 studies. Our meta-analysis revealed a conserved severity-associated gene signature pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM) and increased IL1R2 expression in monocytes and neutrophils from patients with bacterial sepsis, COVID-19, and influenza. Analysis of tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients showed that IL-6 signaling blockade partially reduces this signature and results in a compensatory increase in G-CSF. To validate the role of these cytokines in vivo, we used a mouse model of influenza infection that recapitulates severity-associated increases in IL1R2+ monocytes and IL1R2hi neutrophils, and demonstrate that combined IL-6 and G-CSF blockade inhibits their production. Our study demonstrates the cooperative role of G-CSF and IL-6 in driving the production of severity-associated IL1R2+ myeloid cells and highlights the link between myeloid dysregulation and tissue injury during severe infection.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) can infect a wide range of animal species, including swine and rodents. Infection in pigs is associated with significant economic losses in the global pork industry and is characterized by acute, often fatal disease, as well as central nervous system (CNS) invasion, which leads to neurological manifestations. Although PRV replication has been extensively characterized in certain murine neuronal cell lines such as Neuro-2a, the mechanisms underlying PRV-induced neuroinflammatory injury and necroptosis remain largely unclear. In this study, Kunming mice and mouse astrocytes (C8-D1A) were infected with PRV-GXLB-2013 at different doses to evaluate neurological injury and inflammatory responses. Given that the NF-κB/MLKL signaling pathway was found to be activated during PRV infection, a selective MLKL inhibitor, necrosulfonamide (NSA), was applied to investigate the role of necroptosis in PRV-induced neuroinflammatory damage. Mice infected with higher viral doses showed increased mortality, severe neurological symptoms, elevated brain inflammation, and pathological changes. In C8-D1A cells, PRV infection significantly upregulated inflammatory cytokines and key components of the NF-κB/MLKL pathway. Importantly, NSA treatment markedly reduced these inflammatory responses, mitochondrial damage, and cellular necrosis.

        <tr id="Background: In just twenty years, three dangerous human coronaviruses—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have exposed critical gaps in early detection of emerging viral threats. Current diagnostics remain pathogen-focused, often missing the earliest phase of infection. A virus-agnostic, host-based diagnostic capable of detecting responses to viral intrusion is urgently needed. Methods: We hypothesized that the lungs act as biomechanical instruments, with infection altering tissue tension, wave propagation, and flow dynamics in ways detectable through subaudible vibroacoustic signals. In a matched case–control study, we enrolled 19 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls across two Johns Hopkins hospitals. Multimodal data were collected, including passive vibroacoustic auscultation, lung ultrasound, peak expiratory flow, and laboratory markers. Machine learning models were trained to identify host-response biosignatures from anterior chest recordings. Results: 19 COVID-19 inpatients and 16 matched controls (mean BMI 32.4 kg/m2, mean age 48.6 years) were successfully enrolled to the study. The top-performing, unoptimized, vibroacoustic-only model achieved an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67–0.92). The host-covariate optimized model achieved an AUC of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.94–1.0), with 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 82–100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI: 85–100%). Vibroacoustic data from the anterior chest alone reliably distinguished COVID-19 cases from controls. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that passive, noninvasive vibroacoustic biosignatures can detect host response to viral infection in a hospitalized population and supports further testing of this modality in broader populations. These findings support the development of scalable, host-based diagnostics to enable early, agnostic detection of future pandemic threats (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04556149).">

        <tr id="Machupo virus (MACV), a member of the Arenaviridae family and causative agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, results in lethality rates of 25–35% in humans. Mice lacking the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1−/−) have previously been shown to succumb to MACV infection within 7–8 days via the intraperitoneal route. Despite these reports, we observed partial lethality in STAT-1−/− mice following challenge with wild-type MACV. Serial sampling studies to evaluate the temporal progression of infection and pathologic changes after challenge revealed a two-phase disease course. The first phase was characterized by viral load and pathological lesions in the spleen, liver, and kidney followed by a second, lethal phase, defined by high viral titers and inflammation in the brain and spinal cord resulting in neurological manifestations and subsequent mortality. Tissue adaptation in the brains of challenged STAT-1−/− mice resulted in a fully lethal model in STAT-1−/− mice (mouse-adapted; maMACV). A similar two-phase disease course was observed following maMACV challenge, but more rapid dissemination of the virus to the brain and overall pathology in this region was observed. The outcome of these studies is a lethal small rodent model of MACV that recapitulates many aspects of human disease.">

        <tr id="Purpose The relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 and RA through immune inflammation. Methods First, we conducted a meta-analysis on the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization rate, and mortality rate for patients with RA. Then, Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate the causal relationship between COVID-19 and RA, and further analyzed the cytokines and immune cells in COVID-19 and RA. Finally, we obtained microarray datasets of COVID-19, RA patients, and normal controls from the GEO database. And performed functional, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analysis on differentially expressed genes between each group. Results The meta-analysis results suggested that the hospitalization rate and mortality rate of RA patients infected with COVID-19 were higher than those of the control population. MR analysis showed a positive correlation between COVID-19 infection and RA. We also found that interleukin 13 was associated with RA and COVID-19 infection. CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells and CD3 on CD39 + CD8 + T cells are common immune cell phenotypes in two diseases. In addition, COVID-19 function is enriched in immune responses mediated by leukocytes and neutrophils, while RA is significantly enriched in the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes. The results of immune cell infiltration showed that both diseases had more neutrophils and fewer CD8 T cells. Conclusion There are many similarities between COVID-19 and RA in immune inflammatory responses such as cytokines and immune cells. COVID-19 may lead to the development of RA through immune inflammation. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40659-025-00620-7.">

        <tr id="Background Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) affects millions globally, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying acute COVID-19 and its chronic sequelae remain poorly understood. Methods We performed an integrative transcriptomic analysis of three independent RNA-seq datasets, capturing the complete COVID-19 pathophysiology from health through acute severe infection to post-acute sequelae and mortality (n=142 total samples). We implemented a containerized analytical pipeline from data download, quantification, differential gene expression to uniformly process these three RNA-seq datasets. Results Our analysis reveals striking molecular dichotomies contrasting disease phases with profound clinical implications. Acute severe/critical COVID-19 reveals predominant enrichment of TNF-α signaling via NF-κB pathways (normalized enrichment score >2.5, FDR <0.001), reflecting a cytokine storm pathophysiology characterized by rapid inflammatory developments involving IL-6, TNF-α, and anti-apoptotic responses. In contrast, PASC patients exhibit dominant enrichment of Myc Targets V1 and Oxidative Phosphorylation pathways (NES >2.2, FDR <0.005), indicating important shifts toward cellular adaptation. Pathway signature analysis identifies core differentially expressed genes that reliably distinguish disease phases, thereby offering objective biomarkers for precision diagnosis and monitoring. Conclusions These findings establish a comprehensive molecular framework distinguishing acute inflammatory from chronic metabolic COVID-19 phases, with potential clinical applicability. TNF-α/NF-κB pathway signatures identify patients at risk for severe disease progression, while Myc/OXPHOS signatures allow objective PASC diagnosis, addressing current reliance on subjective and eliminative diagnosis. This integrative analytical framework has utility beyond COVID-19, offering an applicable approach for precision medicine implementation across other diseases processes. Clinical Significance This study transforms COVID-19 from a symptom-based to a molecularly-defined disease spectrum, enabling precision diagnosis, prognostic monitoring, classification, and targeted therapeutic possibilities based on pathway-specific biomarkers rather than subjective clinical assessments.">

        <tr id="Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disease caused by inappropriate activation of the immune system that targets central nervous system antigens, such as myelin. Some MS therapies control the disease through the depletion of CD20+ B cells and the sequestration of T lymphocytes in lymph nodes. A targeted approach aimed at depleting only activated T lymphocytes, which play a key role in disease progression, would be optimal. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on exhausted and recently activated T cells. We have previously reported success with [177Lu]Lu-anti-PD-1 (177Lu-αPD-1) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) as a standalone treatment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is the most common preclinical model of MS. In this study, we present the synergistic effect of fingolimod (FTY720/Gilenya™) in combination with [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1 in EAE. Methods [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1 and [111In]In-αPD-1 were prepared by conjugating a commercial anti-murine PD-1 antibody with a DOTA bifunctional chelating agent. Therapy using [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1 ± FTY720 was initiated at the EAE symptom onset in MOG 35–55 immunized C57Bl/6 mice. ImmunoSPECT/CT imaging utilizing [111In]In-αPD-1 was performed with or without FTY720 administration at the symptom onset in EAE mice. Flow cytometry was performed on spinal cord mononuclear cells isolated from EAE mice 7 days post treatment with RIT ± FTY720. Results [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1 in combination with FTY720 administration significantly reduced long-term paralysis in EAE mice. ImmunoSPECT/CT imaging revealed enhanced lymph node retention of [111In]In-αPD-1 antibody in conjugation with FTY720, corresponding to the presence of activated lymphocytes in lymph nodes. Flow cytometry performed on isolated spinal cord mononuclear cells demonstrated a significant reduction in CD8+ T cell counts in the spinal cords of animals treated with [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1 and [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1 + FTY720. Immunofluorescent microscopy of thoracic spinal cord sections from treated animals demonstrated reduced demyelination and moderate infiltration of CD3+ lymphocytes in the [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1 + FTY720 group at study termination. Conclusion [177Lu]Lu-αPD-1-targeted radioimmunotherapy was synergistically enhanced utilizing the approved MS therapeutic FTY720 through increased lymph node retention and irradiation of activated T lymphocytes. This study paves the way for the application of PD-1+ T cell-targeted radioimmunotherapy as a potential theranostic agent for MS.">

        <tr id="Severe sepsis can escalate to acute lung injury (ALI), a critical condition with limited treatment options. Emerging research highlights the role of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), in regulating epithelial and immune cell responses in sepsis-induced ALI. This study delves into the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis to elucidate its potential in this context. The conducted experiments using Th17 cells differentiated from CD4+ T cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood, co-cultured with transfected Calu-3 cells. The assessed cell viability, RNA, and protein expression levels under inflammatory stimuli. In addition, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues from a cecal ligation and puncture mouse model. Quantification of RNA and protein expression of inflammatory and survival markers provided insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved. Peripheral blood samples from sepsis/ALI patients and healthy controls revealed that circAGFG1 expression is significantly downregulated, while miR-195-5p expression is upregulated in patients compared to healthy individuals. In both Calu-3 cells and induced Th17 cells, as well as in sepsis-induced ALI mouse models, the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis was shown to regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines, Th17 cell differentiation, and markers of epithelial cell survival. Results show the circAGFG1/miR-195-5p/PD-L1 axis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. Targeting this axis could present a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing ALI in sepsis and other conditions characterized by heightened lung inflammation. This research paves the way for new treatment approaches, offering hope for improved outcomes in patients suffering from severe sepsis and ALI.

        <tr id="As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, the extent of their impact on shaping population immunity through repeated waves remains poorly understood. This study assessed age-specific immune responses and the effects of vaccination on neutralization against wild-type (WT) and JN.1 variants. We analyzed 4,371 serum samples from individuals aged 6 months–80 years (May-August 2024). We found that 95.1% of participants had detectable anti-N Ig, suggesting widespread prior infection. Among unvaccinated children (6 months–4 years), 96.5% exhibited anti-RBD or anti-N Ig antibodies mostly from asymptomatic infections. Neutralization against JN.1 did not significantly differ by age, but children aged 6 months–4 years exhibited higher JN.1 neutralization than WT, while individuals aged ≥ 12 years showed the opposite pattern. Unvaccinated individuals demonstrated stronger neutralization against JN.1, whereas vaccinated participants had lower neutralization against JN.1 relative to WT, regardless of vaccine dose. No significant differences in JN.1 neutralization were observed across vaccine doses or age groups. Although 86.5% of participants exhibited neutralizing activity against JN.1, the titers remained relatively low. These findings highlight that almost all children experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that natural exposure maintains immunity in adults. Infection-driven boosting may improve community-wide protection and alleviate immune imprinting, offering key insights for optimizing vaccine strategies.

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Lung structural cells form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections. This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the world, but our understanding of causation is still lacking. A current evidence-based hypothesis proposes that certain infectious agents initiate the neurodegeneration consistent with AD. Two infectious agents correlated to AD pathogenesis are Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), a respiratory obligate intracellular bacterium, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Both organisms may predispose susceptible populations to disease manifestations, such as AD. Methods This review focused on peer-reviewed original research and review articles evaluating the potential association of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with AD. Our focus included: genetic risk with expression of APOEε4 and other biomarkers common to AD including interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and structural/functional aspects of the infectious processes and resultant neuroinflammation. Results Both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may infect the neuroepithelium of the olfactory system to enter the brain. Cpn binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans for entry into mucosal cells. SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelia after binding to ACE2 receptors. Once inside the neuroepithelium, the pathogens may traffic to the olfactory bulbs. NRP1, an abundant receptor in AD, also potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, both pathogens may enter the systemic circulation for eventual entry through the blood brain barrier. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in conjunction with CCL2, co-stimulates macrophages, resulting in IL-6 cytokine release. Likewise, Cpn infection leads to an increase of CCL2 and IL-6 cytokine release. The primary infection of either organism may lead to chronically elevated levels of IL-6 and secondary infection(s). Additionally, host APOEε4 expression appears to increase susceptibility to Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Discussion Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 may enter the brain through olfactory neuroepithelial cells and/or through the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes specific receptors for infection, while Cpn utilizes binding of proteoglycans. Neuroinflammation may be an outcome of infection with one or both organisms as observed by increased levels of CCL2 and IL-6 leading to AD pathogenesis. Genetic risk is noted for infection with both organisms with expression of APOEε4. Ongoing and future studies will further dissect mechanisms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Cpn as they may inform on causation and diagnostic factors for AD.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause skeletal muscle, myocardial, and gastrointestinal lesions. However, it is currently unclear whether these lesions are caused directly by viral infection or indirectly after infection and whether there are differences between different animal models. Here, we first compared the pathological changes of skeletal muscle, myocardium, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle of different COVID-19 animal models (rhesus monkey, hamster, ferret, hACE2 transgenic mice, hACE2-K18 transgenic mice, mink, and cat), and analyzed the possible mechanism of pathological changes. Within 5-7 days of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the three types of muscles in these models were all damaged and inflammatory response to varying degrees, and infiltrating inflammatory cells and factors mainly included CD4T, CD8T cells, macrophages, a small amount of B cells, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and so on. Among them, the pathological changes of the three muscle tissues in the rhesus monkey model were the most significant and closely related to clinical manifestations. It was determined that SARS-CoV-2 can infect these three types of muscles through in situ hybridization and electron microscopy analysis. Therefore, the performance of muscle lesions in each model was not completely consistent and may be related to multiple factors after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including animal species, direct virus invasion, systemic inflammation after infection, and immune status of the body. This study provides a foundation for selecting models to study muscle lesion mechanisms and treatment strategies, highlighting the need for clinical attention to muscle tissue involvement in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between the gut microbiota and systemic immune responses, particularly through the gut–lung axis. Disruptions in gut microbial diversity and function—commonly referred to as dysbiosis—have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we assessed the gut bacteriome and permeability in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using 16S sequencing and ELISA assays, respectively. We also measured blood inflammatory cytokines and fecal secretory IgA to evaluate systemic and mucosal immune responses. Significant alterations in both alpha and beta diversity metrics were observed in patients with COVID-19 (n = 79) and those with post-COVID-19 condition (n = 141) compared to the controls (n = 97). Differential abundance and taxonomic analyses revealed distinct microbial profiles in the infected groups. Increased plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and zonulin were detected in patient samples. Some genera were elevated during acute infection, which was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia-Shigella were associated with increased zonulin levels, indicating compromised intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that gut dysbiosis may contribute to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the gut–lung axis and suggest that modulating the gut microbiota could support immune regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Understanding the intricacies of the host inflammatory response to coronaviruses is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies to mitigate the severe consequences of these infections. Various coronaviruses can trigger the host immune response, leading to highly similar inflammatory reactions. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to the same group of beta-coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-2 and induces high pathogenicity in mice, typically serves as a safety model for investigating highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, replication, and virus-host interactions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of mouse bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) infected with MHV. Results We characterized the global gene changes at both the mRNA and protein levels following viral infection, identifying ten genes involved in various anti-MHV biological processes. Furthermore, by integrating our findings with relevant published data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells, we observed significant similarities in the responses to MHV and SARS-CoV-2, particularly regarding immune and inflammatory responses. Discussion These findings underscore how our research enhances the understanding of global gene expression alterations during coronavirus infection and facilitates the identification of novel antiviral targets.">

        <tr id="Background The global circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an increasing number of reinfections, raising concerns about their clinical and immune consequences. Understanding the differences in disease severity, vaccination impact, and immune response between primary infections and reinfections is essential for guiding public health strategies. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 2023 to June 2024. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection cases were matched 1:2 with primary infection cases using nearest neighbor propensity score matching (PSM) to balance age, sex, and comorbidities between the groups. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, serum antibody levels, lymphocyte subsets, and the impact of vaccination on disease severity were analyzed. Results A total of 907 patients were included, comprising 821 with primary infection and 86 with reinfection. After matching, 131 cases remained in the primary infection group and 75 in the reinfection group. No significant differences were observed in disease severity, mortality, or most clinical symptoms. Trend analysis revealed that an increasing number of vaccine doses was significantly associated with a decreasing trend in severe disease in both the primary infection group (P = 0.0221) and the reinfection group (P = 0.0449). IgG levels were significantly higher in reinfected patients (P < 0.001), whereas IgM levels showed no significant difference (P = 0.474). Among patients with primary infection, severe cases exhibited lower T cell counts than non-severe cases (P < 0.001), but no significant differences in T cell subsets were observed between non-severe and severe reinfections. Conclusions The higher IgG levels in reinfected individuals suggest a robust immune memory response, while T cell depletion plays a crucial role in severe primary infections. Vaccination provided a protective effect against severe disease in both primary and reinfected individuals, with a significant decreasing trend in severe/critical cases as the number of vaccine doses increased.

M2 microglia efferocytosis is essential for resolving neuroinflammation, but its regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study explored the GAS6/AXL signaling pathway in SAE, hypothesizing its role in enhancing anti-inflammatory responses and efferocytosis. A mouse model of SAE was established via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and cognitive impairments were assessed through behavioral tests. Brain tissues and microglia were isolated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify genes associated with the GAS6/AXL pathway. Recombinant GAS6 (rGAS6) protein and an AXL inhibitor were used to examine the pathway’s effects on microglial Rac1 activity and functionality. Results demonstrated that GAS6/AXL activation significantly upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced efferocytosis, and suppressed pro-inflammatory responses, improving cognitive outcomes. These findings highlight GAS6/AXL as a critical modulator of microglial functions, providing a promising molecular target for treating SAE.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and often exhibit reduced vaccine efficacy due to chronic immunosuppression. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, understanding immune responses following natural infection remains critical for informing protection strategies in this vulnerable population. We conducted a longitudinal study of SOT recipients who had recovered from Omicron BA.1 or BA.2 infection, evaluating immune responses to the JN.1 subvariant at 4-6 weeks and 1 year postinfection.


METHODS
Neutralizing antibodies to JN.1 were measured using a pseudovirus neutralization assay, and JN.1-specific T-cell responses were assessed by flow cytometry. Frequencies of bulk T-cells and innate immune cells, identified via flow cytometry, and their correlation with adaptive responses were also analyzed.


RESULTS
At 4-6 weeks, 30% of participants had detectable JN.1-neutralizing antibodies, rising to 43% at one year, although titers remained low. In contrast, CD4⁺ T-cell responses were robust and detected in 75%-83% of participants at 4-6 weeks, increasing to 75%-93% by 1 year. CD8⁺ T-cell responses were observed less frequently. Exploratory correlations between innate and bulk T-cell subsets with heterologous adaptive immune responses were investigated but did not reveal statistically significant relationships.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer important insights into the durability and breadth of immunity following natural infection in immunocompromised transplant recipients. While heterologous neutralizing antibodies were limited, sustained CD4+ T-cell responses may help mitigate severe disease following exposure to JN.1-derived variants, which continue to dominate the SARS-CoV-2 landscape.">

        <tr id="Background The interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections presents a critical challenge to immunopathogenesis. While HIV infection induces progressive CD4+ T cell depletion and chronic immune dysfunction, SARS-CoV-2 triggers complex host responses, ranging from localized antiviral defense to systemic hyperinflammation. We aimed to illustrate the plasma proteomic profiles of hospitalized patients coinfected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Methods Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the plasma protein profiles in three matched groups: (1) seven hospitalized patients with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, (2) seven people living with HIV (PLWH) who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, and (3) seven healthy controls. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed on the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Results We quantified 5,373 proteins across 21 samples and identified significant alterations in multiple proteins in people living with HIV (PLWH) with COVID-19 compared to both PLWH and healthy controls. These DEPs were associated with inflammatory responses, immune cell migration, degranulation, and, notably, the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition, we identified DEPs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral receptors, proteases, transcription factors, and kinases. Conclusions The proteomic profile highlighted the disruption caused by COVID-19 in immunomodulation, thrombosis, and viral entry pathways in PLWH. Further validation of these signatures could improve risk stratification and tailored interventions for this vulnerable patient cohort.">

        <tr id="Although COVID-19 was originally considered a respiratory illness, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have far-reaching impacts on the nervous system. Neurological symptoms such as chemosensory dysfunction are frequently observed during acute infection and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases will go on to develop new or persistent long-term symptoms, a condition known in the literature as post-acute symptoms of COVID-19 (PASC) or by the patient-coined term Long COVID. Common neurological symptoms in Long COVID include new onset cognitive difficulties, dysautonomia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The emergence of Long COVID has prompted renewed interest in the study of post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly in the area of neuroimmune interactions. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current body of literature on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Long COVID, with an emphasis on neuroimmune mechanisms drawn largely from autopsy studies and animal models. A more complete understanding of neuroimmune crosstalk in Long COVID will not only guide the development of therapies for this highly disabling condition but will also contribute to our general understanding of neuroimmune interactions in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Psychostimulants such as methamphetamine (Meth) induce high dopamine (DA) levels in the brain, which can modify immune cells expressing DA receptors. This is relevant in conditions of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), overlapping with substance use. However, the effects of DA on HIV latency phenotypes are largely unknown. We used single-cell methods and gene network computational analysis to understand these relationships, using the U1 latent promonocyte model to identify signatures of latency and its reversal in the context of DA exposure. Our findings point to mechanisms by which high DA levels in the brains of substance users may impact HIV transcription and neuroinflammation. Our data indicate that latency is maintained along with the expression of histone linkers and components of chromatin organization, with increased metabolic pathways that may lead to pathways in neurodegeneration. DA exposure decreased latency signature genes, histone linkers, and protein-containing complex organization components, unleashing inflammatory pathways and HIV gene transcription. Overall, this work suggests that DA can induce latency reversal through mechanisms that can be harnessed to drive cells. The proposed methods developed here in cell lines can be used to identify latency signatures in other HIV infection systems.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Several years after the COVID‐19 pandemic, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immunity and the potential protective role of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination through trained immunity remain a subject of investigation. This study aimed to determine the long‐term impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on immune cells and the association between BCG vaccination, latent infections and COVID‐19 severity and sepsis progression. Methods We conducted a prospective analysis of patients who recovered from mild/severe/critical COVID‐19 (n = 97, 3–17 months after COVID‐19) and sepsis patients (n = 64). First, we assessed the impact of COVID‐19 and its severity on immune cell frequencies and expression of functional markers. Further, we analysed plasma titres of anti‐Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies and their association with COVID‐19 severity and sepsis outcome. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID‐19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐2 and LPS. Results Post‐COVID‐19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterised by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post‐critical COVID‐19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. A trend toward improved outcomes in BCG‐seropositive COVID‐19/sepsis patients was observed, although this may be confounded by age differences between groups. In contrast, the monocyte response to stimulation appeared unaffected by COVID‐19 severity. Conclusion These findings highlight the long‐term alterations of immune cells in post‐COVID‐19 patients, emphasising the substantial impact of COVID‐19 on immune function.">

Despite advances in virology, the molecular mechanisms governing CHIKV’s interaction with host cells remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to identify novel host protein interactors of the CHIKV nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), a critical component of the viral replication complex, using mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiling in liver-derived Huh7 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS identified a wide array of host proteins associated with nsP3, revealing 52 proteins classified as high-confidence (FDR of 1%, and unique peptides > 2) CHIKV-specific interactors. A bioinformatic analysis using STRING and Cytoscape uncovered interaction networks enriched in metabolic processes, RNA processing, translation regulation, cellular detoxification, stress responses, and immune signaling pathways. A subcellular localization analysis showed that many interactors reside in the cytosol, while others localize to the nucleus, nucleolus, and mitochondria. Selected novel host protein interactions were validated through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Our findings provide new insights into the host cellular pathways hijacked by CHIKV and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention. This is the first report mapping direct nsP3–host protein interactions in Huh7 cells during CHIKV infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are marked by systemic inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, lymphopenia, and chronic immune dysfunction, with limited therapeutic options for recovery. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection, mirrors these immune pathologies, providing a valuable translational model. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy combined with antiviral treatment in cats with effusive FIP. Hematologic, virologic, and immunologic analyses were conducted over 12 weeks. Antiviral therapy reduced cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by downregulating inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. MSC-treated cats demonstrated enhanced immune recovery, evidenced by reduced expression of exhaustion-related transcription factors (IKZF2, ZEB2, PRDM1) and increased regulatory T-cell populations, promoting immune homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes revealed transcriptomic shifts indicative of immune rejuvenation, including elevated memory T-cell markers (IKZF1, GZMK, IL7R) and reduced hyperproliferative lymphocyte subsets. Serum cytokine analysis revealed 3 distinct inflammatory mediator patterns using principal component analysis. Both treatment groups showed transitions toward cytokine profiles resembling those of healthy controls. Notably, residual cytokine elevations persisted at the study’s end, mirroring features of chronic immune dysregulation. PDGF-bb, a marker of tissue repair, was uniquely associated with higher lymphocyte counts, suggesting its role in lymphoid recovery. This study highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction and support durable immune recovery. The findings underscore its translational relevance for addressing severe viral diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, advancing both veterinary and human medicine.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to pathogenesis. Viral infections are potential environmental triggers that influence PD pathology. Using ViroFind, an unbiased platform for whole virome sequencing, along with quantitative PCR (qPCR), we identified human pegivirus (HPgV) in 5 of 10 (50%) of PD brains, confirmed by IHC in 2 of 2 cases, suggesting an association with PD. All 14 age- and sex-matched controls were HPgV negative. HPgV-brain positive patients with PD showed increased neuropathology by Braak stage and Complexin-2 levels, while those positive in the blood had higher IGF-1 and lower pS65-ubiquitin, supporting disruption in metabolism or mitophagy in response to HPgV. RNA-Seq revealed altered immune signaling in HPgV-infected PD samples, including consistent suppression of IL-4 signaling in both the brain and blood. Longitudinal analysis of blood samples showed a genotype-dependent viral response, with HPgV titers correlating directly with IL-4 signaling in a LRRK2 genotype–dependent manner. YWHAB was a key hub gene in the LRRK2 genotypic response, which exhibited an altered relationship with immune-related factors, including NFKB1, ITPR2, and LRRK2 itself, in patients with PD who are positive for HPgV. These results suggest a role for HPgV in shaping PD pathology and highlight the complex interplay between viral infection, immunity, and neuropathogenesis.">

Various cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and peripheral immune cells, interact in the pathological process of AIS, profoundly influencing the disease's prognosis. This review, for the first time, summarizes the biological functions and interaction mechanisms of microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, their subgroups, and infiltrating peripheral immune cells at different time points and spatial distributions following AIS, from the perspective of spatial single-cell omics. Spatial transcriptomics technology combines high-resolution gene expression information with tissue spatial architecture, enabling researchers to precisely identify the spatial distribution and dynamic crosstalk between CNS-resident cells and peripheral immune cell subsets. Intervening in the interactions between cell subgroups or different cell types and effectively targeting specific subgroups in the target area, may help minimize the negative effects of harmful subsets while enhancing the functions of beneficial ones. The application of spatial single-cell transcriptomics provides an unprecedented perspective for understanding the complex intercellular interactions following stroke, laying the foundation for precision interventions and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Background Recent findings indicate that hyperinflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 are major contributors to the severity and fatality of COVID-19. Pattern recognition receptors, particularly Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4), have been implicated in detecting SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially the spike protein. However, the role of viral structural components in triggering innate immune responses remains poorly understood. Methods and results HEK293 reporter cells, engineered to stably express TLR2 or TLR4, and THP-1 differentiated macrophages were exposed to various spike protein components and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Protein levels of cytokines were detected by ELISA and mRNA expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrate that the S1 subunit and full-length spike protein elicit TLR4-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. TLR4 activation was triggered by the monomeric, but not the homotrimeric, form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Conclusions These findings suggest that distinct elements of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein differentially activate TLR4 signaling pathways, driving innate immune and inflammatory responses.

        <tr id="Polytrauma with significant bone and volumetric muscle loss presents substantial clinical challenges. Although immune responses significantly influence fracture healing post-polytrauma, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation require further investigation. While previous studies examined either injury site tissue or systemic tissue (peripheral blood), our study uniquely investigated both systemic and local immune cells at the same time to better understand polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation and associated impaired bone healing. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a rat polytrauma model, we analyzed blood, bone marrow, and the local defect soft tissue to identify potential cellular and molecular targets involved in immune dysregulation. We identified a trauma-associated immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cell population that drives systemic immune dysregulation, immunosuppression, and potentially impaired bone healing. We found CD1d as a global marker for TIM cells in polytrauma. In the local defect tissue, we observed Spp1+ monocytes/macrophages mediating inflammatory, fibrotic, and impaired adaptive immune responses. Finally, our findings highlighted increased signaling via Anxa1-Fpr2 and Spp1-Cd44 axes. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of immune dysregulation-mediated nonunion following traumatic injury and provides biomarkers that could function as treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes play pivotal roles in maintaining neural architecture and function. However, their pronounced heterogeneity, especially in reactive states where distinct subtypes can adopt potentially opposing functions (e.g., neuroprotective vs. neuroinflammatory), complicates our understanding of their net contributions to neurological disorders. A critical challenge arises because these functionally distinct subpopulations often coexist, and the lack of precise tools to separately monitor or manipulate them has significantly hindered efforts to dissect their specific roles in disease progression. Here, we address this gap by developing and optimizing fluorescent RNA sensors mediated by endogenous adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) for application in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes. We employed a streamlined screening methodology to enhance sensor specificity and functionality for complement component 3 (C3), a key marker predominantly associated with neuroinflammatory astrocytes, thus enabling subtype-specific tracking and providing a crucial tool for distinguishing these cells within heterogeneous populations. By integrating the biological complexity of astrocytes with the technological precision of ADAR-mediated sensing, this study establishes a robust framework for investigating astrocyte dynamics.">

We used multi-color lineage tracing in a human primary organotypic skin model to reveal that viral resistance is encoded within specific cellular lineages. These lineages create distinct boundaries that block viral spread. Our lineage analyses in vitro confirmed that viral susceptibility exhibits strong heritability across cell generations, with siblings and cousins displaying remarkably similar infection outcomes. ATAC and proteomics profiling of resistant and susceptible clones revealed distinct epigenomic and proteomic states, with the transcription factor AP-1 emerging as a potential central regulator of lineage-encoded viral resistance. Inducing AP-1 activity with PMA rendered cells resistant to viral infection, suggesting a causative role in mediating resistance memory. Our findings demonstrate that antiviral resistance in human skin cells is encoded within cellular lineages and preserved through cell divisions, revealing how cell memory may shape infection dynamics and viral containment in tissues.">

        <tr id="Unresolved inflammation and fibrosis are the two key features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of steatotic liver disease that can evolve into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although innate immunity has been well studied in MASH, the role of CD4⁺ T cells remains underexplored despite their potential to coordinate immune responses by providing help to other immune cells, promoting inflammation, or regulating immune activity through effector and regulatory subsets. To better understand the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MASH, we comprehensively characterized hepatic CD4+ T cells in murine and human MASH at a single-cell protein, transcriptional, and functional level. Mass cytometry and CITE-sequencing revealed a marked shift in intrahepatic CD4⁺ T-cell composition in MASH, with enrichment of Th1, regulatory, and cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells. Similar phenotypic changes were mirrored in the peripheral blood and validated in human MASH samples. Functional assays demonstrated increased production of IFNγ and TNFα by hepatic CD4⁺ T cells, highlighting their proinflammatory effector activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified Tnfrsf4 (OX40) upregulation in hepatic CD4⁺ T cells during MASH.

        <tr id="Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection is known to cause hand-foot-mouth disease, which may develop severe symptoms such as encephalitis, herpangina, and paralysis, leading to pulmonary edema and even death in children under five years old. Existing animal models for EV-A71 pathogenesis have limitations, necessitating novel models to study human-relevant disease mechanisms. Using glycoproteomic profiling to identify EV-A71-interacting proteins, we previously discovered human nucleolin (hNCL) as an attachment molecule that enhances viral binding and infection in vitro. Here, we developed human nucleolin transgenic (hNCL-Tg) mice to investigate EV-A71 pathogenesis in vivo. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, EV-A71-infected hNCL-Tg mice exhibited higher clinical scores, progressive limb paralysis, and increased mortality. Six days post-infection, hNCL-Tg mice showed elevated viral loads in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle, with pronounced EV-A71 VP1 expression in these tissues and the brainstem. Histopathology revealed severe skeletal muscle damage and significant pulmonary edema, characterized by lung congestion, hemorrhage, and erythrocyte infiltration into alveoli. Infected hNCL-Tg mice also displayed elevated levels of encephalitis- and pulmonary edema-associated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13). These findings establish the hNCL-Tg mouse as a robust model for studying EV-A71 pathogenesis and evaluating preclinical therapeutics.

        <tr id="Introduction Cerebral cytokinopathies are key examples of dysregulated cytokine responses. While mouse models with targeted production of individual cytokines have been pivotal in establishing a causal link between cytokines and disease— especially in the central nervous system—they often fail to replicate the complex inflammatory environments seen in various neuropathological conditions, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, where multiple cytokines are upregulated. Methods To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice, by combining transgenic mice with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 (GFAP-IL6 mice) and IFN-α (GFAP-IFNlo mice). Results Our findings reveal that chronic, low-level production of IFN-α, below the typical disease-inducing threshold, significantly accelerates disease progression in GFAP-IL6-IFNlo mice compared to GFAP-IL6 mice. The double transgenic mice exhibited progressive ataxia, persistent seizure-like episodes, and reduced survival. Remarkably, the clinical and pathological symptoms remained predominantly IL-6-driven and required the presence of adaptive immune cells. Conclusion In summary, we demonstrate that subclinical levels of IFN-α can markedly exacerbate IL-6-mediated neurological disease, suggesting that future studies, should consider the combined effects of IL-6 and IFN-α.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can infect the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory route. Following intranasal instillation, VSV moves along the axons of olfactory sensory neurons to the olfactory bulb. While within the olfactory bulb the spread of the virus is controlled by microglia activation and the recruitment of peripheral leukocytes, some of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we used mice with conditional deletions of the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an adaptor for RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling. By selectively deleting MAVS in neurons, astrocytes, or long-lived myeloid cells, we discovered that RLR signaling specifically within brain-resident myeloid cells is crucial for protection against the virus. Infected mice with a MAVS deletion in these myeloid cells showed normal myeloid cell and leukocyte infiltration into the brain. However, the P2RY12+ microglia showed aberrant expression of genes involved in antigen cross-presentation. Furthermore, flow cytometry experiments revealed diminished MHC class I expression on MAVS deficient microglia. Moreover, CNS infiltrating CD8+ T cells had dysfunctional transcriptional profiles. Therefore, our findings indicate that during viral CNS infection, MAVS signaling in brain-resident myeloid cells, presumably microglia, is essential for antigen cross-presentation and the relicensing of protective, infiltrating CD8+ T cells.

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Monkeypox (Mpox) are viral infections that have similar modes of presentation, diagnosis and treatment strategies. Understanding their co-infection dynamics and immune response is important for public health policies. Aim This article aims to determine the relationship between dynamicity and immune response interactions between Mpox and COVID-19, focusing more on the implications for disease severity, viral transmission, and vaccine efficacy. Methodology An extensive literature review was conducted through electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from the last decade (2014–2024) using keywords: COVID-19, Co-infections, Immune response, Monkeypox, and Vaccination. Results Several co-infections between COVID-19 and Mpox have been reported, especially a case from Florida, in the United States of America (USA), in Barcelona, Spain (a 56-year-old man who suffered both Mpox and COVID-19 and syphilis simultaneously, and from Italy (a 36-year-old male). Both COVID-19 and Mpox have been shown to have some effects on the immunity of a person, especially the innate system, which can occasionally produce inadvertent effects. A common factor that links the two diseases is the endoglycosidase named Heparanase (HPSE). Both COVID-19 and Mpox clinical features have bizarre severity and complications. The rising co-infection of COVID-19 and increased Mpox infection rate has led to the development of only approved vaccines JYNNEOS and COH04S1. Conclusion Global efforts such as adequate awareness campaigns through webinars, social media platforms, and research, including experimental studies, cohort studies, case series, etc., should be put in place to give more insights into both diseases. Such efforts should be backed up with good political will, adequate funding, the establishment of research facilities and interprofessional measures among the concerned countries and policymakers in the world.">

        <tr id="Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. Its high mortality rate reflects limited therapeutic options and a poor understanding of disease-causing signaling. We show that the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for increased mortality in a model of secondary HLH (sHLH). Unexpectedly, neither deletion of the NLRP3-activated pyroptotic effector GSDMD nor combined deletion of the inflammasome-activated cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 conferred strong protection from sHLH. Instead, co-deletion of GSDMD and caspase-8–activated GSDME limited sHLH-driven lethality, demonstrating redundancy in the pyroptotic machinery required to induce sHLH. We also found that bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors prevent NLRP3-driven pyroptosis, which acted by blocking inflammasome priming. BET inhibitors prevented increased NLRP3 levels in diseased tissue, limited the production of sHLH-associated IL-1β, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor, and protected from sHLH pathogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting NLRP3 could limit sHLH and identify clinically relevant bromodomain-selective BET inhibitors capable of eliminating NLRP3-driven pyroptosis and the sHLH cytokine storm.">

Numerous studies have documented metabolic changes occurring during both the acute phase of the disease and the recovery phase, which, in some cases, contribute to the development of long COVID syndrome. Aims and methods In this study, we aimed to evaluate clinical, laboratory, and comprehensive metabolomic data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the second, third and fourth waves (Alpha, Delta, and Omicron). A targeted, fully quantitative metabolomics assay (TMIC MEGA Assay) was used to measure 529 metabolites and lipids in plasma samples. The metabolomic profiles of these patients were compared according to different and relevant factors impacting COVID-19 outcome, such as age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination status. Results Among the 21 classes of compounds evaluated in this study, amino acids and lipids were the most dysregulated when comparing age, sex, comorbidities, vaccination status, and the different epidemiological waves. This is the most comprehensive analysis in Mexico providing absolute quantitative data for 529 metabolites and lipids measured in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which could be used to monitor their metabolic status and clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection or with long COVID syndrome.">

        <tr id="Immune cell activation is a feature of COVID-19, that leads to cytokine storm which causes neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, related to psychiatric symptoms due to the depletion of neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate which play a major role in adult neurogenesis. ACE2 receptors are expressed in the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in this region is a major factor behind the neuropsychiatric disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain indirectly through neuroinflammation and altered neurochemical signaling and even mild COVID-19 infections can lead to sustained microglial activation, which disrupts neural networks and impairs cognitive function. The long COVID-19 may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in those who recovered and immunological response may affect synaptic pruning and reduced anterior cingulate cortex volume at one year after COVID-19. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC, commonly known as Long COVID is a significant public health concern and "brain fog" is one of the most debilitating cognitive impairments, affecting memory, concentration, and executive function occurring in 88% of cases. Brain fog may be linked to persistent changes in neurotransmitter levels, particularly involving dopamine and serotonin which play an essential role in cognition, attention, and emotional regulation. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the chemokine CCL11, is linked to cognitive impairments in patients with persistent symptoms. Neuroprotective agents that support neuronal health, such as antioxidants and mitochondrial enhancers and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic and direct current enhance cortical excitability are investigated in cognitive recovery. Evaluation of the currently predominant VUM (a Variant Under Monitoring), LP.8.1, and the most recently designated NB.1.8.1, is increasing as 10.7% of global sequences reported recently due to minor mutations in spike protein.

        <tr id="Peripheral nerve injury initiates a complex cascade of events coordinating immune responses, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and neuronal repair. While β2-microglobulin (B2M) is well known for its role in MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell differentiation, its potential contributions to non-immune processes remain underexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of B2M in peripheral nerve regeneration using a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model in wild-type and B2M-deficient (B2M-KO) mice. Flow cytometry, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed to assess T-cell subset dynamics and gene expression following injury. Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cell populations increased by day 7 post-injury. While CD3+CD4+ T-cell expansion occurred in both groups, a significant increase in CD3+CD8+ T cells was observed only in wild-type mice. RNA-seq analysis at 3 days post-injury—prior to substantial T-cell accumulation—revealed marked downregulation of ECM-related genes in B2M-KO mice, including collagens, matrix-associated proteins, and other key ECM components. KEGG analysis identified suppression of ECM–receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt, and TGF-β signaling pathways. qPCR confirmed reduced expression of Thbs1 in B2M-KO mice. These findings suggest that B2M plays a critical, CD8+ T-cell-independent role in regulating ECM dynamics and regenerative signaling during early nerve repair, expanding the conceptual framework of B2M’s function beyond classical immune roles.">

Depletion of CD4+ T cells diminished MHC-II expression on joint macrophages, highlighting their potential role in inflammation. In addition, treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of CHIKV replication during chronic disease reduced viral RNA and joint inflammation, suggesting that viral RNA replication promotes chronic joint disease.

We report raw sequence data and normalized log2 transformed gene expression values. This data will allow researchers in the field to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways between the two cell types and over times post infection. Furthermore, our data enables comparisons to molecular studies performed in humans and animal models in the context of respiratory viral infections.">

However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for immunopathology during DAD progression are largely undefined. Here, by integrating single cell RNA sequencing, functional assays, and genetic/pharmacological interventions in a mouse model of ricin-induced DAD, we revealed a significant accumulation of neutrophil with an activated phenotype that plays a critical role in immunopathology. We observed the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during DAD, which further intensified inflammation and tissue injury. IL-17A signaling activity was upregulated in DAD-affected lungs, while IL-17A deficiency or functional blockade significantly attenuated neutrophil recruitment, NET generation, and tissue damage. Mechanically, IL-17A stimulates lung resident fibroblasts to produce the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1. Notably, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) emerged as the dominant source of IL-17A, highlighting a triad of interactions among ILC3, fibroblast, and neutrophil in DAD pathogenesis. This finding delineates a pathogenic IL-17A-neutrophil-NET axis that amplifies lung immunopathology after ricin-induced DAD, a deeper understanding of these relationships may pave the way for mitigate DAD immunopathology and other lung inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="While viral pathogens are often subdivided into neurotropic and non-neurotropic categories, systemic inflammation caused by non-neurotropic viruses still possesses the ability to alter the central nervous system (CNS). Studies of CNS disease induced by viral infection, whether neurotropic or not, are presented with a unique set of challenges. First, because brain biopsies are rarely necessary to diagnose viral-associated neurological disorders, antemortem tissue samples are not readily available for study and human pathological studies must rely on end-stage, postmortem evaluations. Second, in vitro models fail to fully capture the nuances of an intact immune system, necessitating the use of animal models to fully characterize pathogenesis and identify potential therapeutic approaches. Non-human primates (NHP) represent a particularly attractive animal model in that they overcome many of the limits posed by more distant species and most closely mirror human disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. Here, we review NHP infection models of viruses known to infect and/or replicate within cells of the CNS, including West Nile virus, the equine encephalitis viruses, Zika virus, and herpesviruses, as well as those known to alter the immune status of the brain in the absence of significant CNS penetrance, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the current era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV−2. This review focuses on viruses with an established role in causing CNS disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, and myelitis and NHP models of viral infection that are directly translatable to the human condition through relevant routes of infection, comparable disease pathogenesis, and responses to therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the diverse clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including neurological complications. This study investigates cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles to identify proteins associated with neuroinflammatory processes in COVID-19. CSF samples from 11 critically ill patients and 5 COVID-19-negative controls were analyzed using high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 203 proteins were identified, of which 76 exhibited differential expression peptides (DEPs). Proteins involved in coagulation (fibrinogen alpha and beta chains, prothrombin) and immune responses (complement cascade components, immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma, kappa, and lambda subunits) were significantly upregulated in COVID-19 patients. In contrast, proteins involved in antioxidant defense (e.g., superoxide dismutase) and neural maintenance (e.g., neural cell adhesion molecule 1, Neuronal cell adhesion molecule) were significantly downregulated. Functional annotation revealed enriched pathways associated with hemostasis, immune regulation, and neuroinflammatory responses. Protein–protein interaction analysis highlighted interactions among complement and coagulation cascade components, underscoring their roles in inflammation and potential thrombotic complications. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces significant alterations in the CSF proteome, reflecting neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms. Identifying these proteins and their association with diverse pathophysiological mechanisms provides insights into the neurological impact of COVID-19 and may serve as therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications in post-COVID-19 neurological syndromes.">

        <tr id="Treatment of glioblastoma (GB), the most common and most aggressive malignant brain tumor, has made little progress over the past two decades. Despite extensive research on apoptosis and autophagy, necrotic cell death mechanisms like pyroptosis, which have the potential to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses, remain largely underexplored in GB. Here, we investigated whether Gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis can be induced in GB by employing the drug raptinal, an inducer of cytochrome c release. Using human patient-derived and mouse GB cell lines, we showed that raptinal promotes GSMDE cleavage. However, although a strong pyroptotic response was observed in mouse cell lines, it was weak in human cell lines. This resistance was partially reversed by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, indicating that membrane repair mechanisms may counteract the pyroptotic response. Gsdme knockout (KO) in mouse GB cells unexpectedly prolonged the survival of immunocompetent mice, demonstrating a tumor-promoting role of GSDME independent of its pyroptotic function. Analysis of the immune microenvironment revealed that Gsdme KO promoted infiltration of T cells, which was confirmed by spatial transcriptomic analysis of GB patient samples. In addition, Gsdme/GSMDE KO reduced the invasive capacity of mouse/human GB cells. In conclusion, active membrane repair mechanisms may impair the pyroptotic efficacy in GB. GSDME has a tumor-promoting role in GB by suppressing T cell infiltration and increasing tumor cell invasion.">

Although these are mostly represented by B cells, the CD20 marker is expressed by 2–6% of T cells (CD20+ T), which are effectively depleted in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients by anti-CD20 mAbs. CD20+ T cells are characterized by a pro-inflammatory phenotype and increased potential for migrating and invading the central nervous system (CNS) compared to CD20− T cells. Furthermore, CD20+ T cells are detected within brain inflammatory lesions from MS patients and actively participate in the experimental MS model. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on CD20+ T cells, from their identification and characterization to evidence of depletion by disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), likely contributing to therapeutic efficacy. Conflicting hypotheses on the origin and development of CD20+ T cells will also be discussed, as well as evidence from clinical and preclinical studies supporting their pathogenetic role in MS.">

This study investigated the potential of sEVs as biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant patients, focusing on their role in organ transplants. Plasma samples from five lung transplant recipients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and five healthy controls were analyzed. The sEVs were isolated using an Invitrogen Exosome Isolation Kit, characterized by Nanosight NS300 for particle size (< 200 nm), and quantified for protein concentration using the BCA assay. Extracted protein from the sEVs was subjected to SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and western blotting to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. The results showed that the isolated sEVs from infected lung transplant patients contained significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins compared to those from the control group. Western blot analysis revealed strong bands corresponding to the spike and nucleocapsid proteins in infected patients, with statistical significance (p < 0.0001 for spike protein and p < 0.05 for nucleocapsid protein). These findings indicate that sEVs may serve as biomarkers for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate these results and explore the broader therapeutic applications of sEVs in disease contexts. This study supports the potential utility of sEVs in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and monitoring transplant status, warranting additional investigation into their diagnostic value.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY The mechanisms by which viruses enter host cells are crucial for their ability to infect and cause disease, serving as major targets for both host immune responses and therapeutic strategies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry process is primarily driven by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, in conjunction with the activity of endosomal cathepsin L and the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, recent scientific advances have expanded our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, uncovering alternative receptors and novel cofactors that may enhance viral tropism and adaptability. Given the critical role of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in mediating host cell entry, it has become a primary target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. However, the continuous spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of S protein variants that may potentially confer a fitness advantage or modify key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology, such as transmissibility, infectivity, antigenicity, and/or pathogenicity, posing significant challenges to the efficacy of current interventions. In this review, we provide an updated and comprehensive overview of the latest advances in SARS-CoV-2 entry pathways and molecular mechanisms, exploring their implications for antiviral drug discovery, vaccine design, and the development of other biomedical strategies while addressing the challenges posed by the ongoing evolution of the virus.">

        <tr id="Introduction Azithromycin improves symptomology in various chronic airway diseases exacerbated by viral infections. However, the mechanisms underlying the apparent antiviral effects of azithromycin remain unclear. Methods Airway epithelial cells from healthy children were cultured, expanded and differentiated into air-liquid interface cultures. Submerged and differentiated primary cultures were treated with 10 µM of AZM for 24 h and subsequently infected with human rhinovirus (HRV)-1b for 24 h. Virus receptor expression, replication, progeny release and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, −6, −8 and IP-10) were then measured. Barrier integrity was determined via qPCR, in-cell western (ICW), immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, confocal microscopy, transepithelial electrical resistance (RT) measurement and an apparent permeability (P app ) assay. Results Treatment with AZM for 24 h at the concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 µM did not have any significant impact on either cellular viability or cytotoxicity in un-infected cells. No significant effect on viral receptor, cytokine expression was observed in non-infected cells treated with 10 µM AZM. Similarly, there was no significant change in both occludin and ZO-1 expression in non-infected cells. However, claudin-1 gene expression was significantly reduced but corresponding protein expression was significantly increased following 10 µM AZM. Although RT was significantly lower, this was not corroborated by any significant change in epithelial permeability after 10 µM AZM treatment. Subsequent to HRV-1b infection, 10 µM AZM treatment significantly reduced cytotoxicity induced by infection. Viral receptor expression were not affected with AZM pre-treatment but a significant decrease in viral replication was observed. Except for IP-10, expression of IL-1β, −6, and −8 was significantly reduced. Gene and protein expression of key epithelial junctions were significantly higher in treated, infected cells, which were concomitant with epithelial barrier function. Discussions This study identified that AZM can protect against HRV-1b-induced epithelial damage. Our data, demonstrating the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and barrier-protective effects in vitro are strongly indicative of pleiotropic mechanisms of AZM for mitigating viral infection and its consequences. These effects are likely to contribute to the benefits observed in clinical trials of AZM in a number of chronic respiratory diseases.">

        <tr id="Preventing T cell migration to the central nervous system (CNS) has remarkable therapeutic effects in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) but is poorly effective against the progressive form (PMS). Disability progression in PMS likely results from an interplay between smoldering local inflammation and neurodegeneration. The mechanisms sustaining the chronicity of PMS are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the potential role of tissue-resident memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Trm cells) in sustaining chronic CNS autoimmunity. We showed that CD4+ Trm cells were present in the CNS of mice with chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and in brain tissues from persons with PMS. Using flow cytometry and immunohistofluorescence analysis, we revealed the presence of bona fide CD4+ Trm cells expressing characteristic Trm cell surface markers, including CD69, CXCR6, P2RX7, and CD49a, in the CNS of mice with EAE and in the brains of persons with PMS. These T cells also expressed the transcription factor Hobit in mice with chronic EAE. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis uncovered the transcriptional heterogeneity and inflammatory potential of CD4+ Trm cells, and, accordingly, these cells localized within CNS inflammatory lesions of mice with EAE and persons with PMS. Last, either genetic or pharmacological depletion of CD4+ Trm cells combined with antibody-mediated depletion of the recirculating CD4+ T cell compartment alleviated neurological signs during the chronic phase of EAE. Our results indicate that CD4+ Trm cells contribute to maintain a chronic inflammatory state in the CNS and suggest that therapeutic strategies for PMS should consider targeting the CNS-resident T cell compartment.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke ranks among the top global causes of disability and mortality, with a highly dynamic pathological process. Post-stroke neuroinflammation, mediated by microglia, demonstrates a dual role in both injury and repair. The CX3CR1/CX3CL1 signaling axis, highly expressed in microglia, acts as a key regulator. This review examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of the axis across the stroke process and its involvement in neural repair. Crucially, this signaling pathway demonstrates stage-dependent functional duality: its cellular sources, receptor expression profiles, and functional consequences undergo temporally orchestrated shifts, manifesting coexisting or interconverting protective and damaging properties. Ignoring this dynamism compromises the therapeutic efficacy of targeted interventions. Thus, we propose a triple precision strategy of “stroke phase—biomarker—targeted intervention”. It uses specific biomarkers for precise staging and designs interventions based on each phase’s signaling characteristics. Despite challenges like biomarker validation, mechanistic exploration, and cross-species differences, integrating cutting-edge technologies such as spatial metabolomics and AI-driven dynamic modeling promises to shift stroke therapy toward personalized spatiotemporal programming. Temporally targeting CX3CR1 signaling may offer a key basis for developing next-generation precision neural repair strategies for stroke.">

        <tr id="Introduction 1-5% of all patients with COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to have symptoms after initial recovery. Symptoms associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS) include, among others, fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction. Since the dysregulated immune response appears to be caused by the sustained activation of certain immune cells, including monocytes, and the release of specific cytokines, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PACS disease on monocyte subpopulations. Methods Twenty-two healthy and thirty-two patients with PACS were included into this study. We performed blood gas analysis and measured hematological parameters from peripheral blood of PACS patients and compared them with healthy donors. Surface markers to identify monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results PACS patients had higher numbers of intermediate and CD56+ monocytes, whereas the numbers of total monocytes, classical and non-classical monocytes were normal compared to healthy donors. Comparison of patients with and without fatigue, cough, and dyspnea showed no difference in monocyte subset frequencies. However, patients with cognitive dysfunction had increased numbers of non-classical monocytes compared to patients without this symptom. Discussion This suggests a disturbed homeostasis of the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with PACS.">

        <tr id="Objective Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by high clinical heterogeneity and complex immunopathological mechanisms. Immune dysregulation plays a central role in its progression. This study aims to investigate the compositional changes of immune cells, characteristics of intercellular communication, and potential regulatory mechanisms of N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in sepsis, with a particular focus on the functional remodeling of platelets. Methods This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE167363 dataset) from sepsis patients with m6A methylation sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Through systematic analysis, we compared the differences in immune cell composition, developmental trajectories, intercellular communication, and m6A modifications among healthy controls, survivors, and non-survivors, and further screened for key m6A-regulated target genes. Results The analysis revealed that platelets gradually accumulated during the progression of sepsis, while B cells, T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibited a trend toward platelet-like phenotypic remodeling. Cell–cell communication analysis showed a marked decline in communication strength among immune cells as the disease worsened, particularly a significant weakening of the APP–CD74 signaling pathway between platelets and B cells, indicating impaired immune network synergy. m⁶A methylation sequencing revealed distinct remodeling of m⁶A peaks and dysregulation of related regulatory factors in non-survivors. Further integrative analysis identified RPA1 as a key m⁶A-regulated target gene, whose expression was closely associated with APP and co-regulated by multiple m6A-modifying factors. Conclusion This study reveals disruptions in immune cell interactions and an m6A-dependent mechanism of platelet functional remodeling during sepsis progression. The identification of the key target gene RPA1 offers new insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of sepsis and lays a theoretical foundation for future precision interventions and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) involves dysregulation of innate immune cells including monocytes, especially in progressive MS. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are essential for fatty acid transport and metabolism in multiple cell types. FABP7, a brain-FABP, maintains metabolic function in astrocytes and neural stem cells, but the effect of FABP7 on monocytes is unknown. Here we find elevated levels of FABP7 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with secondary progressive MS. Elevated serum FABP7 levels positively correlate with higher disability scores, brain lesion volumes, and lower brain volumes. FABP7 levels are increased in astrocytes from MS postmortem brain lesion. Mechanistically, in vitro treatment of FABP7 induces CD16, CD80 and IL-1β expression in monocytes via increased glycolysis. FABP7-induced gene expression reflects enhanced inflammation, chemotaxis and glucose metabolism in monocytes. In conclusion, we find that FABP7 induces pro-inflammatory profiles in monocytes, correlates with disability and represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for progressive MS.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in providing strong immunity within a relatively short time frame, significantly reducing both the severity of the disease and associated mortality. However, post-vaccination complications, particularly neurological disorders, have been reported. Among the more frequently documented neurological complications are acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis (TM), optic neuritis (ON), Bell's palsy (BP), and Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). The precise role of COVID-19 vaccines in triggering the onset or relapse of these conditions remains uncertain. Immunological processes involving cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, and immune cells are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of these neurological side effects. This review examines the immune responses triggered by COVID-19 vaccines and their potential role in the development of such complications. Despite reports of neurological side effects, these cases remain rare, and the overall benefits of vaccination in curbing the pandemic and preventing severe illness far exceed the risks. It is vital to sustain the progress of global vaccination efforts while continuously evaluating the risk-benefit ratio, particularly for individuals with underlying conditions. Ongoing research and surveillance are crucial for creating safer vaccines and identifying individuals who may be more susceptible to adverse reactions, ensuring broader protection against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Pathological inflammation with a loss of synaptic integrity and function has been implicated in HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although therapeutics exist to increase the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH), they are not effective at preventing neuroinflammation and HIV induced neuronal damage persists. In this study, we investigate the ephrin-B/EphB axis, which regulates inflammation, in post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and experimental models in order to assess its potential role in HIV induced neuroinflammation. Methods We analyze mRNA samples of post-mortem brain specimen of PLWH and uninfected controls obtained from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC) and, for comparison, of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Follow-up experiments employ mouse brain tissue and in vitro models, including immortalized human microglia, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mixed neuroglial cell cultures, cellular and molecular interference, functional and multiplex assays, immunofluorescence and mRNA sequencing to examine the role of the ephrin-B/EphB axis in neuroinflammation and the associated neurotoxicity. Results Using qRT-PCR we find increased expression of EphB2 in post-mortem brain of PLWH, and detect a correlation with pro-viral DNA, viral RNA and an inverse correlation with abstract executive function and verbal fluency. Increased expression of ephrin-B/EphB at mRNA and protein level is also observed in brains of a transgenic mouse model of neuroHIV suggesting the upregulation can be driven, at least in part, by expression of viral gp120 envelope protein and a type I interferon, IFNβ. Additionally, we find induction of ephrin-B1 expression in microglia following activation by IFNβ. Given the previously reported impact of EphB2 on inflammation in the periphery, the functional role of EphB2-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling on microglia is assessed for a pro-inflammatory and anti-viral signature. We find that EphB2 treated microglia secrete inflammatory and anti-viral factors but also exert contact-independent neurotoxicity. Finally, knockdown of microglial ephrin-B1, an EphB2 binding partner, shows a partial alleviation of the microglial pro-inflammatory signature and neurotoxicity. Conclusion Our study suggests that elevated EphB2, and its reverse signaling through ephrin-B1 in microglia contribute to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in neuroHIV.

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy in vivo of a DIM formulation with fish oil (Cesarox Epi) against influenza A (H1N1) infection in mice and against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. In a model of lethal influenza pneumonia induced by A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus, we showed that 5 days’ treatment with DIM Epi at 10, 20, and 60 mg/kg/day delayed the time to death, prevented body weight loss, and resulted in significant improvements in survival. DIM Epi tested in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV2 Dubrovka (Wuhan-like) strain at doses 50 and 100 mg/kg/day reduced clinical signs, weight loss, temperature elevation, and lung pathology. In both models of infections, treatment with DIM Epi did not significantly decrease viral titer in the animals’ lungs. DIM Epi and Oseltamivir were more effective against influenza infection when given in combination than given singly, while co-administration of DIM Epi with Molnupiravir did not yield an additive benefit against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings support DIM Epi as a promising host-directed adjunct therapy for viral pneumonia with potential to enhance outcomes in respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination remains essential to prevent severe COVID-19, particularly in vulnerable populations such as older adults. This study evaluated the durability and dynamics of immune responses following booster vaccination(s) in >65-year-old individuals and examined their association with protection against new infections. Methods: Immune responses were evaluated at 3, 9, and 15 months post-booster, measuring SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies against spike [IgG(S)] and nucleocapsid [IgG(N)] proteins, neutralizing activity against the Omicron BA.2 variant, and cellular immunity. A subset of participants was tested before booster administration. Regression analyses examined the influence of clinical and immunological factors—including a bivalent fourth dose—on infection risk over time. Results: Booster vaccination significantly enhanced IgG(S) and neutralizing capacity, peaking at 3 months. Although a decline was observed by 9 months, responses remained above baseline. Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited higher IgG(S) levels and neutralizing titers, and significantly lower reinfection rates (15%), compared to uninfected individuals. A fourth vaccine dose further increased IgG(S) levels. While neutralizing capacity was not consistently enhanced by the fourth dose, recipients experienced a lower rate of new infections. Immune trajectory analyses revealed that breakthrough infections elicited strong humoral responses comparable to those seen in previously infected individuals, highlighting the role of hybrid immunity. Conclusions: In older adults, booster vaccination induces durable immune responses, with hybrid immunity offering enhanced protection. A fourth dose boosts antibody levels and reduces infection risk, supporting its use in this high-risk group. Continued monitoring is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of boosters, particularly against emerging variants.">

Most enteric neurons reside within the myenteric plexus of the enteric nervous system in the muscular region, forming a structure called the muscularis externa. Despite established interactions between muscularis macrophages and neurons, the presence and function of other immune cell types remains poorly characterized. Here, we mapped the muscularis immune cell landscape, revealing that diverse cell types are present within distinct locations of the GI tract, and they lie in proximity to neuronal cell bodies and their axons. Using a hypothesis-free computational approach, we identify putative ligand–receptor interactions from publicly available single-cell RNA datasets and further validate one of these (App-CD74).

        <tr id="Objective: Various cellular pathologies in leukocytes contribute to the pathology of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we
aimed to determine the prognostic significance of netotic and pyroptotic cell deaths in relation to disease severity in COVID-19 pathophysiology.
Materials and Methods: Serum samples were collected from a total of 150 patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, as defined by
the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines, along with 89 healthy individuals. Circulating markers of netosis and pyroptosis, including
neutrophil elastase (NE), citrullinated histone H3 (CitH-H3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18, and
IL-8, were analyzed using the ELISA method. The effects of netosis and pyroptosis markers on disease severity and clinical parameters were
comparatively evaluated, and their associations with inflammation, thrombosis, and fibrinolysis were also investigated.
Results: NE, GSDMD, IL-18, MPO, CITH3, D-dimer, leukocyte and lymphocyte levels, as well as inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin), showed
a significantly elevated in severe COVİD-19 patients compare to the other groups.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that circulating netosis and pyroptosis markers in SARS-CoV-2 infections correlate with inflammation,
dysregulated hemostasis, and fibrinolysis markers, playing a role in disease prognosis. These associations may provide potential therapeutic
targets for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.

However, recent studies have strengthened the evidence that the reactivation of the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in the post-COVID-19 era has significantly contributed to the exacerbation and prolongation of Long COVID symptoms. The mechanism and pathophysiology of EBV reactivation in Long COVID patients still need further exploration due to limited studies. This review summarises the various studies linking EBV reactivation in Long COVID along with its pathophysiology and novel therapeutics for EBV in a post-COVID-19 era.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes play a crucial role in mediating neuroinflammation, particularly under pathological conditions where they can enter into senescent or gliotic states. This study explored the induction of these two astrocytic states using the same stressor, palmitate, in primary cortical astrocytes. A transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct expression profiles both astrocytes phenotypes. Senescent astrocytes upregulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest and the Senescence‐Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), including IGFBP5, CDKN1A, and p53. In contrast, reactive astrocytes upregulated genes related to immune response, complement activation, and inflammation, such as C3, LCN2, and pro‐inflammatory cytokines like IL‐11 and CXCL12. Despite these differences, both astrocytic states shared pro‐inflammatory characteristics, contributing to neuroinflammation. The secretory profiles further distinguished the two states: senescent astrocytes produced higher levels of interleukins, including IL‐6 and IL‐18, indicative of sustained inflammatory responses. Gliotic astrocytes, on the other hand, secreted higher levels of chemokines, such as MCP‐1 and GRO‐α, involved in immune cell recruitment and tissue repair. Senescent astrocytes were more active in cytokine production, while gliotic astrocytes promoted immune responses and tissue repair through chemokine production. Understanding these distinct roles provides valuable insights for developing therapeutic interventions to mitigate neuroinflammation and support healthy brain aging.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has affected at least 989 dairy herds across 17 states in the United States (U.S.) and resulted in 70 confirmed human infections, underscoring the urgent need to understand the pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions of emerging H5N1 viruses. In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections.">

Using SARS-CoV-derived ssRNA sequences, we modeled age-dependent immune responses in mice. Aged mice exhibited higher mortality and severe lung inflammation upon viral ssRNA challenge, mirroring clinical observations. We uncovered a pre-existing inflammatory state in aged mice, characterized by elevated baseline levels of specific immune cells and cytokines correlating with poor outcomes. Age-related immune dysfunction stemmed from impaired IRF7 signaling and defective SNARE-mediated cytokine secretion in CD11b+ cells. Notably, the adoptive transfer of young CD11b+ cells to aged mice exposed to SARS-CoV2 ssRNA reduced mortality, alleviated lung inflammation, and normalized cytokine profiles. These findings provide insights into age-related immune dysregulation during viral challenges and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19 in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Increased iron levels, common in neurodegenerative diseases, correlate with disease severity, suggesting a role in the pathological process. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the role of iron in cerebral inflammatory processes. Employing astrocyte cell models of genetic neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by iron imbalance, such as the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders, can provide valuable insights into astrocytes reactivity, a pivotal process in brain inflammation. Specifically, we employed human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes from Neuroferritinopathy, where iron accumulation is primary. After confirming iron accumulation and the deregulation of proteins involved in iron management, we observed that at 35 days since the beginning of differentiation, the elevated iron levels not only trigger ferroptosis but also place the astrocytes in a reactive state. This is evident in the higher extracellular concentrations of IL-6, IL-1β, and glutamate, along with changes in morphology, genes, and proteins involved in astrocyte reactivity. Interestingly, by day 60, IL-6 and IL-1β levels drop below those of the controls, and we observe a reversal in most of the factors considered. Moreover, at day 60, it is possible to observe not only increased senescence but also ferroptosis. These findings demonstrate that iron plays a primary role in inducing astrocyte reactivity.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. However, its high infectivity makes comprehensive research with the active virus challenging. Here, we use virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type mice and in mice that express the human tau protein. VLP exposure elicits changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings in primary somatosensory and motor cortices reveal substantial short-term increases in cortical activity in VLP-injected mice, with increased stimulus-evoked activity in both genotypes and elevated spontaneous activity in the human tau genotype only. Vehicle-injected human tau mice also show increases in cortical activity patterns. Over the following weeks, activity metrics partially subside but do not completely return to baseline levels. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. Middle-aged human tau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background and overexpression of the tau protein, exhibit more severe pathobiology and may be at risk for more adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGluR4, encoded by Grm4), is a neurotransmitter receptor, known to play roles in tumor progression and immune modulation through the nervous system. Here we show that mGluR4 may regulate immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME) also via non-neuronal mechanisms. We observe that dendritic cells (DC) from mGluR4-deficient mice display enhanced migration, maturation and antigen-presentation capacity, which promote T cell and NK cell responses against tumor cells. Tumor growth and metastases are suppressed in Grm4-/- mice in different preclinical tumor models, including orthotopic liver cancer, subcutaneous melanoma, colorectal tumors, and fibrosarcoma. We show that the tumor suppressive effect of Grm4-deficiency requires host immunity, in particular CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and IFNγ, but independent of the nervous system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and ex vivo assays show changes in the composition and functional state of the immune TME. Mechanistically, mGluR4 suppresses the adenyl cyclase/PKA signaling pathway, leading to metabolic reprogramming of DCs. Importantly, adoptive transfer of DCs pretreated with the AC agonist forskolin therapeutically suppressed tumor growth in an orthotopic liver cancer model. Our study thus demonstrates that mGluR4 is a checkpoint for DC maturation and that mGluR4 may serve as an immunotherapeutic target.">

As a newly identified type of cell death, its involvement in poxvirus infection and pathogenesis remains unclear. Since MPXV shares biological and pathogenic similarities with other poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus (VACV), we used VACV-infected cell and mouse models to demonstrate that VACV infection induces ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of ferroptosis significantly reduce virus replication and alleviates the inflammatory response. Additionally, we observed that VACV infection upregulates prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which contributes to virus-triggered ferroptosis and inflammation. This study identifies a novel form of cell death triggered by poxvirus infection, shedding light on host–pathogen interactions and offering a potential therapeutic target for MPXV and other Orthopoxviruses.">

As key mediators of cytotoxic immunity, CD8 T cells play a crucial and multifaceted role in ZIKV pathogenesis. While essential for controlling viral replication, their infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS)—an immune-privileged site—raises potential concerns regarding immunopathology. This review explores the dual roles of CD8 T cells during ZIKV infection, emphasizing both their antiviral functions and their potential to drive neuroinflammation. We examine how ZIKV infection and chemokine-mediated signals facilitate immune cell trafficking across the blood–brain barrier, drawing parallels with other neurotropic flaviviruses. We also explore how therapeutic agents, such as the S1P receptor modulator FTY720, influence lymphocyte trafficking and CNS immune regulation. Finally, we review emerging interventions—including vaccines, antivirals, immunomodulators, and passive immunotherapies—that aim to achieve effective viral control while minimizing neural damage. A balanced understanding of immune cell responses in flavivirus infections is essential for guiding future therapeutic strategies against ZIKV and related neurotropic viruses.">

        <tr id="Influenza causes 3–5 million severe cases globally each year, with severe viral pneumonia often requiring hospitalization for over four weeks. While the inflammatory response to influenza infection helps control viral replication, excessive inflammation is a key driver of disease severity and mortality. Excessive pulmonary lymphocytes, particularly IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes, contribute significantly to pulmonary inflammation at the late-stage of H1N1 viral infection. Cyclosporin A, a potent T-cell inhibitor, mitigates influenza A virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. However, the therapeutic role of lymphocyte suppression in cyclosporin A-mediated attenuation of H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the viral titer was 0 in all the homogenized lung tissues of mice on Day-21 post a sublethal H1N1 viral infection. H1N1 viral infection caused worsened general condition and pulmonary inflammation with the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils on Day-21 post-infection. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of H1N1 virus-infected mice showed a 16-fold higher lymphocyte count compared to neutrophils. H1N1 viral infection significantly elevated both IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations and IFN-γ levels in mouse lungs. H1N1 viral infection additionally expanded IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations in both spleen and peripheral blood. Cyclosporin A treatment significantly mitigated H1N1 viral infection-induced worsened general condition, pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation, increases of pulmonary IFN-γ concentrations and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes in the lung, spleen and blood of mice on Day-21 post-infection. Together, lymphocytes may contribute significantly to H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation. Cyclosporin A may alleviate H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation through decreasing IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes.

        <tr id="The global dissemination and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become a worldwide crisis with staggering confirmed cases and death tolls. Although prophylactic vaccines are widely applied to curb the spread of the virus, these protections are greatly weakened by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Non-structural protein 12 (NSP12) of SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays an essential role in viral replication and transcription, representing a promising target for drug development. Currently, extensive drugs are designed to specifically target and inhibit NSP12 activity, while highly infectious and drug-resistant variants have significantly compromised their efficacy. Here, we identified that arsenic trioxide (ATO) could specifically reduce not only WT SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 but also mutant NSP12 levels, along with low toxicity. Moreover, the reduction of NSP12 was caused by its robust ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after ATO treatment. Of note, STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 was found to be the E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of NSP12 by ATO. In short, our findings provide a potential intervention to restrict virus replication and may broaden the scope of therapeutic application for ATO.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been widely recognized as a respiratory illness, yet growing evidence highlights its significant neurological and psychiatric impact. Neuropsychiatric manifestations range from mild symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, to severe conditions including delirium, stroke, and psychosis. These symptoms may occur during the acute phase or persist long after recovery, contributing to what is known as long COVID. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial, involving direct viral invasion, immune response, and psychosocial stressors. Understanding these effects is essential for comprehensive patient care and for developing long-term strategies in neuropsychiatric evaluation and treatment. This literature review was conducted using scientific publications found in the following databases: Virtual Health Library (BVS), Public Medline (PubMed), CAPES Periodical Portal, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), with no time restriction. The official websites of the Ministry of Health and gray literature were also consulted. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the extensive neuropsychiatric impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting individuals across all age groups and clinical profiles. Both acute and long-term manifestations—ranging from cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders to severe neurological complications—underscore the virus’s capacity to disrupt central and peripheral nervous system function, as well as mental health. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms, early identification of symptoms, and a multidisciplinary approach to treatment are essential to mitigate these outcomes. Given the ongoing burden of long COVID, continued clinical vigilance, mental health integration into routine care, and investment in longitudinal research are crucial. As we transition from pandemic to endemic phases, addressing the neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 must remain a global public health priority.">

        <tr id="Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a spectrum of disease outcomes in infected humans, ranging from asymptomatic or tolerant to lethal. While the virus itself contributes to pathogenesis, disease severity is primarily influenced by the host’s response to infection. One factor observed to impact the host response is sex, as epidemiological data indicates that male persons have a higher case fatality rate than females infected with MERS-CoV. However, the mechanism underlying this sex bias is unknown and disease course remains difficult to predict. This study investigates how male and female transgenic mice expressing humanized dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (hDPP4) respond to MERS-CoV infection following exposure to either a tolerance-inducing low dose or lethal high dose. We observed that female hDPP4 mice display dose-dependent tolerance to infection and males experienced uniformly lethal disease in both dosing groups. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that males suppress innate and inflammatory responses early after infection, causing delayed induction of the host antiviral response. In contrast, high dose females mount an immediate and sustained interferon and inflammatory response, activating antiviral effectors and interferon-stimulated genes. Tolerant females displayed the greatest transcriptional control, showing no pathway enrichment and minimal changes in weight throughout infection. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the response is driven by dose while the nature of the response in shaped by sex. Females mount a more robust response to MERS-CoV infection, allowing females to tolerate low-dose infection but causing uncontrolled inflammation after high dose infection. In contrast, males experienced lethal outcomes regardless of dose. By examining the dynamics of sex-biased host transcriptional responses in determining disease severity, this study highlights the importance of sex as a biological variable in coronavirus pathogenesis research.">

        <tr id="Despite targeting mainly the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 disrupts T cell homeostasis in ways that may explain both acute lethality and long-term immunological consequences. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the T-cell-mediated chain of immunity and formation of TCR via TREC assessment in COVID-19 and long COVID (LC). For this study, we collected 231 blood samples taken from patients with acute COVID-19 (n = 71), convalescents (n = 51), people diagnosed with LC (n = 63), and healthy volunteers (n = 46). With flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (i.e., naïve, central and effector memory cells (CM and EM), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1, and subpopulations of effector cells (pE1, pE2, effector cells)). Additionally, we measured TREC levels. We found distinct changes in immune cell distribution—whilst distribution of major subpopulations of T cells was similar between cohorts, we noted that COVID-19 was associated with a decrease in naïve Th and CTLs, an increase in Th2/Tc2 lymphocyte polarization, an increase in CM cells, and a decrease in effector memory cells 1,3, and TEMRA cells. LC was associated with naïve CTL increase, polarization towards Th2 population, and a decrease in Tc1, Tc2, Em2, 3, 4 cells. We also noted TREC correlating with naïve cells subpopulations. Our findings suggest ongoing immune dysregulation, possibly driven by persistent antigen exposure or tissue migration of effector cells. The positive correlation between TREC levels and naïve T cells in LC patients points to residual thymic activity. The observed Th2/Th17 bias supports the hypothesis that LC involves autoimmune mechanisms, potentially driven by molecular mimicry or loss of immune tolerance.">

        <tr id="Acute thymic involution (ATI) is frequently observed during sepsis, however the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study demonstrates that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in sepsis-associated ATI. We found that pediatric sepsis patients showed significantly elevated kynurenine (Kyn)/tryptophan (Trp) ratios, indicating increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) activity, along with higher Kyn levels compared to controls. Moreover, Kyn levels were negatively correlated with thymus-to-thorax ratio. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that the enhanced expression of IDO1, induced by inflammatory signals, drives the accumulation of Kyn and subsequent activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), triggering lipid oxidation-related gene transcription and ferroptosis in thymocytes during sepsis. Treatment with 1-methyltryptophan (IDO1 inhibitor) effectively restore thymic function and improve survival in septic mice. Our findings reveal a novel role for the IDO1/Kyn/AhR pathway in ferroptosis, suggesting that targeting this pathway may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for sepsis.

        <tr id="The 2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic has largely subsided, but a key question remains. How did ZIKV evolve to become a virulent human pathogen compared to the virus of its original discovery? What specific virologic and pathologic changes contributed to increased pathogenicity in humans? Phylogenetic studies have identified two genetically distinct ZIKV, the African and Asian lineages, which differ in their pathogenicity. Previous studies including ours suggest that the envelope (E) protein plays a key role in viral entry, immune activation, and neuropathogenesis. This study aimed to further elucidate virologic and pathogenic differences between these lineages by assessing their ability to bind and replicate in host cells, induce apoptotic cell death, trigger inflammatory responses, and influence human neural progenitor cell (hNPC)-derived neurosphere formation. We compared a historic African ZIKV strain (MR766) with an epidemic Brazilian strain (BR15) and evaluated the effects of the E protein inhibitor quercetin-3-β-O-D-glucoside (Q3G) and an E protein-neutralizing antibody (AbII). Our results revealed distinct virologic properties and that MR766 exhibited stronger inhibition of neurosphere formation due to enhanced viral binding to neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, while BR15 infection triggered a heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine response with reduced viral binding. Chimeric virus studies suggested that the E protein likely influences viral binding, replication efficiency, immune activation, and neuropathogenesis. Notably, Q3G exhibited antiviral activities against both MR766 and BR15, whereas AbII preferentially inhibited MR766. These findings highlight the virological differences between ancestral and epidemic viral strains, as well as the critical role of E protein in viral permissiveness, immune response, and neuropathogenesis, providing insights for developing targeted antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes serious respiratory illness and related disorders. Vulnerable populations, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and the elderly, face an increased risk of severe complications. As the pandemic evolves, various diagnostic techniques are available to detect severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), including clinical presentation, rapid antigen/antibody testing, molecular testing, supplemental laboratory analysis, and imaging. Based on peer-reviewed data, treatment options include convalescent plasma transfusion, corticosteroids, antivirals, and immunomodulatory medications. Convalescent plasma therapy, historically used in outbreaks like Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and SARS, is suggested by the World Health Organization for critically ill COVID-19 patients when vaccines or antiviral drugs are unavailable. Neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma help control viral load and improve patient outcomes, especially when administered early, though effectiveness varies. The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized its emergency use for severe COVID-19 cases, but potential risks such as transfusion reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury require further investigation to establish definitive efficacy. Antiviral agents like Remdesivir, an adenosine nucleotide analog, inhibit viral RNA polymerase and have shown efficacy in reducing COVID-19 severity, leading to its emergency use authorization for hospitalized patients. Other antivirals like ritonavir, lopinavir, and umifenovir disrupt viral replication and entry, but their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been used in critically ill COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation and prevent respiratory failure, as shown in the RECOVERY trial. Other immunosuppressants like ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and colchicine help modulate the immune response, reducing cytokine storms and inflammation-related complications. However, corticosteroids carry risks such as hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, and delayed viral clearance, requiring careful administration. Systematic reviews of clinical studies revealed that hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin did not decrease viral load nor reduce the severity of symptoms, but increased mortality among acutely hospitalized patients. There was no improvement in patients’ clinical conditions after 15 days compared to standard treatment. The United States Food and Drug Administration has revoked the authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients due to the null benefit-risk balance. Monoclonal antibodies like itolizumab, gimsilumab, sarilumab, and tocilizumab are being studied for their ability to reduce the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, particularly cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These antibodies target specific immune pathways to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, with some showing promising results in clinical trials, though their use remains under investigation. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/Cas13 family of enzymes, sequenced from many COVID-19-positive patients, can potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, cleave the RNA genome, and aid in the amplification of the genome assay. Cas13 can also target emerging pathogens via an adeno-associated virus vector when delivered to the infected lungs. In addition to pharmacological agents, vaccines effectively prevent symptomatic infection, reduce hospitalizations, minimize mortality rates, and ultimately reduce the severity of the disease. This paper aims to explore the management of patients with underlying conditions who present with COVID-19 to lessen the burden on healthcare systems.">

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral entry into the CNS, where human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is barely expressed, is critical for addressing the neurological consequences of COVID-19. Importantly, the low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3 (LRAD3) is overexpressed in brain cells, suggesting a possible ACE2-independent alternate pathway of viral entry into brain cells. Herein, we report the interaction of the chemically synthesized LRAD3 domains with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We observed that the extracellular domains of LRAD3 depend on calcium for proper folding and maintaining their structural integrity. Our results revealed that domain 1 of LRAD3, which is most accessible from the cell surface, engages with the N-terminal domain of the viral spike protein. These findings open up possibilities to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting ACE2 independent viral entry pathways.">

Pedunculoside (PE) plays a protective role in inflammatory diseases; however, it’s effect and mechanism on myocarditis remains unexplored. Methods In this study, we evaluated the cardioprotective effects of PE in vivo and in vitro using the LPS + ATP-induced cardiomyocyte injury model and the LPS-induced rat myocarditis model, and elucidated its potential mechanism. Results We found that PE demonstrated inhibition of H9c2 cell death and decreased ROS, Ca2+ levels, and MMP loss induced by LPS + ATP. Moreover, PE improved cardiac function in LPS-induced myocarditis rats. Mechanistically, PE suppressed the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, PIP2, and MAPK signaling pathways, which are associated with P2X7R. Additionally, PE interfered with and attenuated the interaction between P2X7R and PIP2, displaying strong docking activity with P2X7R. Conclusion Taken together, PE exhibited significant anti-myocarditis activity by interacting with P2X7R and inhibiting the NLRP3, PIP2, and MAPK pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for clinical myocarditis treatment.">

        <tr id="We recently developed an original HCV-permissive cell culture model based on both partial differentiation and physiological oxygen pressure (Hypo-Diff cells) that produces highly infectious lipid-rich and native-like HCV-lipoviroparticles (LVPs). Here, we explored the precise role of physiological hypoxia and related specific transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible factors 1α and 2α (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) to better understand the mechanism governing viral morphogenesis. Knocking-down HIF-2α specifically reduced both the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets in Huh7.5 Hypo-Diff cells, suggesting a central role for HIF-2 in controlling lipid metabolism under physiological hypoxia. In HCV-infected siHIF-2α Hypo-Diff cells, both HCV replication and the specific infectious viral efficacy of progeny viruses were significantly impaired. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of a mutated form of the HIF-2α protein, stabilized in normoxia, both increased the number and size of neutral lipid-rich droplets and restored the production of highly infectious HCV viruses in the absence of cell differentiation. Finally, by iodixanol fractionation of supernatants to determine the mean buoyant density of infectious HCV LVPs, we established that HIF-2α is exclusively responsible for producing highly lipidated and broadly infectious HCV-LVPs by Hypo-Diff cells. These findings thus clearly establish the central role of physiological hypoxia, and notably HIF-2, in the production of highly infectious lipid-rich native-like HCV particles. Since physiological hypoxia is a shared characteristic in mammalian tissues, we propose to reconsider the role of natural oxygen tension and especially the role of HIF-2 in the life cycle of other lipid-associated viruses, whether hepatotropic or not.

        <tr id="Brain atrophy is a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and more recently SARS‐CoV‐2 infection for which the neuroinflammatory mechanism is not fully understood. Nevertheless, neuroinflammation and CD8 T cell accumulation is frequently observed in postmortem brain tissue of patients with neurodegeneration. We therefore developed a murine model of brain atrophy using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection model of multiple sclerosis. We employ single major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule conditional knockout mice generated by our program to analyze the contribution of immune cell infiltration and onset of atrophy. TMEV infected C57BL/6 mice that singularly express H‐2Kb or H‐2Db were evaluated. TMEV infection of these mice resulted in ventricular atrophy at 14 d.p.i. However, H‐2Db expressing mice presented with significantly greater and continuous ventricular atrophy compared to H‐2Kb expressing mice and MHC class I knockout control mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed H‐2Db expressing mice had greater brain infiltrating CD8 T cell responses at 7 and 28 dpi which correlated with the extent of ventricular atrophy. Meanwhile, H‐2Kb and MHC class I knockout mice also had distinct positive correlations with ventricular atrophy and global neuroinflammation in general. These findings support the role of immune cell infiltration into the CNS as a putative mechanism of ventricular atrophy following TMEV infection, with the progressive enlargement of ventricular atrophy observed in H‐2Db mice being associated with the presence of long‐lived memory CD8 T cells residing in the brain.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
This review highlights recent advances in single cell "-omics" technologies that have transformed our understanding of the HIV reservoir in the central nervous system (CNS) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).


RECENT FINDINGS
Recent studies have applied single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CITE-seq, AIRR-seq, multiomic platforms, and spatial transcriptomics to postmortem brain tissues and CSF. These analyses have revealed that HIV persists in rare subsets of CNS-resident microglia and trafficking CD4+ T cells despite ART. Infected microglia often display inflammatory transcriptional states, while clonal T cell populations harboring HIV can migrate between blood and CSF. Spatial and multimodal approaches are uncovering both the tissue localization and epigenetic regulation of infected cells, offering unprecedented insight into reservoir biology and neuropathogenesis.


SUMMARY
Single cell studies have established the CNS as a transcriptionally active and clonally maintained reservoir of HIV during ART. These findings underscore the need for cure strategies that penetrate the brain, target both lymphoid and myeloid reservoirs, and consider the transcriptional, epigenetic and spatial context of HIV-infected cells. Ongoing technological advances will further illuminate the dynamics of the CNS reservoir and guide the design of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers and CNS-penetrant therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="At least 10% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a variety of multisystem symptoms lasting more than 12 wk known as postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or “long COVID.” While the precise pathogenesis of PASC remains unclear, immune dysregulation is widely recognized as a key factor. Moreover, PASC disproportionately affects older individuals who are prone to age-related immune system decline, which further exacerbates the risk and severity of PASC. The oral cavity, a primary site for initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, may contribute to the development and persistence of PASC. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in age-related oral health, such as periodontitis, salivary gland (SG) dysfunction, and gustatory and olfactory impairments, may create an environment conducive to forming an oral reservoir of intact virus or viral antigens, which may contribute to the chronicity of PASC. Alternatively, the pathogenesis of PASC may increase the risk of a wide range of oral health issues, such as dental diseases, dry mouth, and sensory dysfunction (e.g., taste and smell) that are frequently reported by patients with PASC. This review highlights how aging facilitates oral SARS-CoV-2 infection, co-infection with other viruses may drive PASC in aging patients, aging and PASC dysregulate the oral microbiome, SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes molecular mechanisms involved in oral tissue aging, aging oral health affects susceptibility to developing PASC, and inflammation associated with PASC exacerbates dysregulation of metabolic/enzymatic pathways of aging oral mucosa and diseases of the periodontal apparatus, SGs, and taste. It underscores the urgent need to comprehensively address the interplay between aging oral health and PASC, which will help mitigate long-term complications and improve overall health outcomes for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="People with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) may be more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcomes. COVID-19 vaccination is a key element in mitigating this risk. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Ab), including anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) Ab, are metrics of seroconversion following COVID-19 vaccination in the general population. We assessed if anti-S and anti-RBD antibodies were negatively correlated with COVID-19 infection in IMID.SUCCEED, a prospective Canada-wide study, was conducted in 2 phases. First, between Feb 2021-Jul 2023, adult IMID participants provided dried blood spot samples for anti-S and anti-RBD ELISA testing at intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Second, between Sep 2022-Aug 2023, consenting participants from 4 academic centers in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec (2) also provided monthly saliva samples for PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. We studied subjects receiving at least their primary series (3+ doses) of a COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariable general estimating equation (GEE) models (accounting for repeated measures) evaluated PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva, assessing the effects of anti-S or anti-RBD levels (in separate models) within the 6 months preceding a given saliva sample. We controlled for recent COVID-19 infection, sex, age, medications (conventional immunosuppressives, biologics, and prednisone), and time since last COVID vaccine.366 participants contributed 1,266 saliva samples. Participants were 79.8% female and 85.5% White, with median age 56.7 (standard deviation: 13.8) years. Most participants were taking immunosuppressants (N=252, 68.9%). The majority (N=356, 97.3%) of participants displayed seroconversion at the first saliva sample, defined as ≥11.3 Binding Antibody Units (BAU)/ml for anti-S or ≥31 BAU/ml for anti-RBD. In the GEE models of positive saliva PCR for SARS-CoV-2, (Table 1) a 1000 BAU/ml increase in anti-S was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45-0.97). Anti-RBD Ab levels had a similar effect (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.02).Table 1:Odds Ratios, OR (95% confidence intervals, CI) for Having a Positive COVID-19 Saliva Test in Univariable and Multivariable GEE ModelsIn this large, multi-center sample of COVID-19-vaccinated individuals with IMIDs, most of whom were immunosuppressed, we demonstrated that anti-S Ab levels were associated with lower odds of positive saliva PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, with a similar trend for anti-RBD Ab. This highlights clear benefits for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in IMID.">

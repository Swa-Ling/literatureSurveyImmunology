        <tr id="Introduction Over the past four years, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious global health challenges. The severe form of disease and death resulted from the failure of immune regulatory mechanisms, closely highlighted by the dual proinflammatory cytokine and soluble immune checkpoint (sICP) storm. Identifying the individual factors impacting on disease severity, evolution and outcome, as well as any additional interconnections, have become of high scientific interest. Methods In this study, we evaluated a novel panel composed of ten sICPs for the predictive values of COVID-19 disease severity, mortality and Delta vs. Omicron variant infections in relation to hyperinflammatory biomarkers. The serum levels of sICPs from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital admission were determined by Luminex, and artificial neural network analysis was applied for defining the distinct patterns of molecular associations with each form of disease: mild, moderate, and severe. Results Notably, distinct sICP profiles characterized various stages of disease and Delta infections: while sCD40 played a central role in all defined diagrams, the differences emerged from the distribution levels of four molecules recently found and relatively less investigated (sCD30, s4-1BB, sTIM-1, sB7-H3), and their associations with various hematological and biochemical inflammatory biomarkers. The artificial neural network analysis revealed the prominent role of serum sTIM-1 and Galectin-9 levels at hospital admission in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors, as well as the role of specific anti-interleukin therapy (Tocilizumab, Anakinra) in improving survival for patients with initially high sTIM-1 levels. Furthermore, strong associations between sCD40 and Galectin-9 with suPAR defined the Omicron variant infections, while the positive match of sCD40 with sTREM-1 serum levels characterized the Delta-infected patients. Conclusions Of importance, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulatory immune factors governing the COVID-19 pathology, and identifies key roles of sCD40, sTIM-1, and Galectin-9 in predicting mortality.">

        <tr id="Tissue-specific immune responses are critical determinants of health-maintaining homeostasis and disease-related dysbiosis. In the context of COVID-19, oral immune responses reflect local host-pathogen dynamics near the site of infection and serve as important "windows to the body," reflecting systemic responses to the invading SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study leveraged multiplex technology to characterize the salivary SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological landscape (37 cytokines/chemokines and 11 antibodies) during early infection. Cytokine/immune profiling was performed on unstimulated cleared whole saliva collected from 227 adult SARS-CoV-2+ participants and 37 controls. Statistical analysis and modeling revealed significant differential abundance of 25 cytokines (16 downregulated, 9 upregulated). Pathway analysis demonstrated early SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with local suppression of oral type I/III interferon and blunted natural killer-/T-cell responses, reflecting a potential novel immune-evasion strategy enabling infection. This virus-associated immune suppression occurred concomitantly with significant upregulation of proinflammatory pathways including marked increases in the acute phase proteins pentraxin-3 and chitinase-3-like-1. Irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior vaccination was associated with increased total α-SARS-CoV-2-spike (trimer), -S1 protein, -RBD, and -nucleocapsid salivary antibodies, highlighting the importance of COVID-19 vaccination in eliciting mucosal responses. Altogether, our findings highlight saliva as a stable and accessible biofluid for monitoring host responses to SARS-CoV-2 over time and suggest that oral-mucosal immune dysregulation is a hallmark of early SARS-CoV-2 infection, with possible implications for viral evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Intensive research has illuminated the complex biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its continuous evolution during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. While much attention has been paid to the structure and functions of the viral spike protein and the entry step of viral infection, partly because these are targets for neutralizing antibodies and COVID-19 vaccines, the later stages of SARS-CoV-2 replication, including the assembly and egress of viral progenies, remain poorly characterized. This includes insight into how the activities of the viral structural proteins are orchestrated spatially and temporally, which cellular proteins are assimilated by the virus to assist viral assembly, and how SARS-CoV-2 counters and evades the cellular mechanisms antagonizing virus assembly. In addition to becoming infectious, SARS-CoV-2 progenies also need to survive the hostile innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, such as recognition by neutralizing antibodies. This review offers an updated summary of the roles of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in viral assembly, the regulation of assembly by viral and cellular factors, and the cellular mechanisms that restrict this process. Knowledge of these key events often reveals the vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and aids in the development of effective antiviral therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, iron toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) are widely held to drive tissue damage, yet the specific roles of central nervous system (CNS)- resident versus CNS-invading MPs remain unclear. Here, by combining single-cell profiling with conditional gene targeting, we systematically dissected and interfered with ROS production across CNS MPs in a preclinical model for neuroinflammation. We show that CNS-invading monocyte derived cells (MdCs) exhibit a higher oxidative stress gene signature and produce more ROS compared to CNS-resident microglia. While NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a phagocytic source of ROS, proved redundant, our findings underscore the critical role of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in driving oxidative tissue damage. Quenching mtROS through mitocatalase overexpression in MdCs, but not microglia, significantly alleviated neuroinflammation in mice. Thus, our study resolves a longstanding controversy, identifying MdCs as the primary driver of ROS-mediated neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a devastating impact. Although many survived the acute effects of the pandemic, a significant number of survivors, including those with only mild symptoms, are now experiencing a prolonged and debilitating post-viral syndrome known as LC/PASC (long COVID/post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2). Typical symptoms of LC/PASC include fatigue, breathlessness, chest pain, impaired cognition, difficulty sleeping, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Anxiety and depression can also last for weeks to months and range from mild to disabling. The association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection raises questions about the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry to the central nervous system (CNS) and long-term effects of the virus on the CNS, their molecular basis, and the potential risk of neuronal damage associated with the subsequent development of neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to global public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women. This study delves into the T cell immune responses in pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, all of whom received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Using the ELISpot assay, we measured T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and nucleocapsid peptides in two groups: those infected before and during pregnancy. Our results showed weak to moderate correlations between T cell responses and neutralizing antibody levels, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups. T cell reactivity appeared to decrease over time post-diagnosis, regardless of infection timing. Intriguingly, over half of the participants maintained detectable T cell memory responses beyond one year post-infection, suggesting the long-term persistence of cellular immunity. These insights contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 immunology in pregnant women, highlighting the importance of considering both humoral and cellular immune responses in this high-risk population.">

        <tr id="Neurological complications, including encephalopathy and stroke, occur in a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases but viral protein is seldom detected in the brain parenchyma. To model this situation, we developed a novel low-inoculum K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection during which active viral replication was consistently seen in mouse lungs but not in the brain. We found that several mediators previously associated with encephalopathy in clinical samples were upregulated in the lung, including CCL2, and IL-6. In addition, several inflammatory mediations, including CCL4, IFNγ, IL-17A, were upregulated in the brain, associated with microglial reactivity. Parallel in vitro experiments demonstrated that the filtered supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 virion exposed brain endothelial cells induced activation of uninfected microglia. This model successfully recreates SARS-CoV-2 virus-associated para-infectious brain inflammation which can be used to study the pathophysiology of the neurological complications and the identification of potential immune targets for treatment.">

 The immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still under investigation. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild in the pediatric population, some children develop severe clinical manifestations or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection. MIS-C, typically emerging 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is characterized by a hyperinflammatory response affecting multiple organs. This review aims to explore the complex landscape of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, focusing on innate, T cell-, and B cell-mediated immunity, and discusses the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a superantigen in MIS-C pathophysiology. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving the management and outcomes for affected children.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the impact of viral infections on individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Initial observations suggested lower COVID-19 rates among CF populations; however, subsequent clinical data have presented a more complex scenario. This study aimed to investigate how bronchial epithelial cells from CF and non-CF individuals, including various CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, respond to in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV. Comparisons with the Influenza A virus (IAV) were included based on evidence that CF patients experience heightened morbidity from IAV infection. Our findings showed that CF epithelial cells exhibited reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of the type of CFTR mutation or SARS-CoV-2 variant, as well as the original 2003 SARS-Cove. In contrast, these cells displayed more efficient IAV replication compared to non-CF cells. Interestingly, the reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in CF was not linked to the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor nor to CFTR dysfunction, as pharmacological treatments to restore CFTR function did not normalize the viral response. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and CFTR function influenced the levels of certain cytokines and chemokines, although these effects were not correlated. Overall, this study reveals a unique viral response in CF epithelial cells, characterized by reduced replication for some viruses like SARS-CoV-2, while showing increased susceptibility to others such as IAV. This research offers a new perspective on CF and viral interactions, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these differences.

Both the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2003 and the MERS-CoV outbreak of 2013 resulted in overall low fatalities in part due to inefficient human-to-human spread of each virus. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in 2019, was highly efficient at human-to-human spread and caused a global pandemic resulting in millions of casualties. Zoonotic transmission of viruses, including the three coronaviruses, poses an ongoing threat that cannot be ignored. In this review, we have focused on the diagnostics and therapeutics fronts using SARS-CoV-2 as a model. Specifically, we have selected proteins associated with the virus particles as targets and discussed various platform technologies.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The novel coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 triggered the COVID-19 pandemic with severe economic and social ramifications. As the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory system becomes more understood, growing evidence suggests that the virus also impacts the homeostasis-regulating neuroendocrine systems, potentially affecting other organ systems.


SUMMARY
This review explores the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the neuroendocrine system, highlighting the effect of this virus on various endocrine glands, including the brain, hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, pancreatic islets, gonads and adipose tissue. The viral invasion disrupts normal hormonal pathways, leading to a range of endocrine disorders, including hormonal imbalances, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances.


KEY MESSAGES
There is potential for SARS-CoV-2 to induce autoimmune responses, exacerbate existing endocrine conditions and trigger new-onset disorders. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing treatment strategies that address not only the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 but also its endocrine complications. The review emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endocrine health. .">

        <tr id="The persistence of RNA viruses in the brain is increasingly recognized as a significant factor in the progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This phenomenon is particularly evident in infections caused by various neurotropic and non-neurotropic viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgent need to explore the complex relationship between viral persistence and neurological decline. Growing evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 affects brain structure and function, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by viral infections is thought to accelerate age-related neurodegeneration. While the immune system typically clears many viral infections in the brain, some viruses establish chronic infections, leading to restricted viral replication. These persistent infections can exacerbate neuroinflammation and contribute to ongoing neuronal damage, key drivers of age-related neurodegeneration. This review explores current knowledge on how SARS-CoV-2 infiltrates the brain, evades immune defenses, and persists within brain cells, potentially using them as viral reservoirs. As individuals age, the cumulative effects of such viral infections may accelerate cognitive decline and increase vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of viral persistence and its long-term impact on brain health is crucial for developing targeted therapies to combat these age-related diseases.">

 Studying the early events that occur after viral infection in humans is difficult unless one intentionally infects volunteers in a human challenge study. Here, we use data about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in such a study in combination with mathematical modeling to gain insights into the relationship between the amount of virus in the upper respiratory tract and the immune response it generates. We propose a set of dynamic models of increasing complexity to dissect the roles of target cell limitation, innate immunity, and adaptive immunity in determining the observed viral kinetics. We introduce an approach for modeling the effect of humoral immunity that describes a decline in infectious virus after immune activation. We fit our models to viral load and infectious titer data from all the untreated infected participants in the study simultaneously. We found that a power-law with a power
 h
 < 1 describes the relationship between infectious virus and viral load. Viral replication at the early stage of infection is rapid, with a doubling time of ~2 h for viral RNA and ~3 h for infectious virus. We estimate that adaptive immunity is initiated ~7 to 10 d postinfection and appears to contribute to a multiphasic viral decline experienced by some participants; the viral rebound experienced by other participants is consistent with a decline in the interferon response. Altogether, we quantified the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, shedding light on the early dynamics of the virus and the potential role of innate and adaptive immunity in promoting viral decline during infection.

Whether this is due to the virus itself or is a secondary effect caused by the influx and activation of immune cells is not known. Positron emission tomography (PET) with immunoglobulins can provide insights into which sites and cells are activated in a living animal. Our aim is to use two nanobodies as tools to monitor (1) the distribution of antigen presenting cells (APC) by virtue of their Mafa-DR expression profile, (2) virus-infected cells and viral particles using a nanobody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Two [89Zr]-labeled nanobodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II antigens (Mafa-DR), respectively, are used to monitor their distribution during an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in a nonhuman primate model. Scans are obtained before infection and on Day 3 and 10 post infection (pi) in two macaques each. The [89Zr]anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike nanobody localized to SARS-CoV-2-associated lung lesions and the nasal mucosa, while the [89Zr]anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR nanobody was predominantly found in non-affected lung tissue after infection. We also detected, pi, upregulation of the Mafa-DR signal, indicative of recruitment of professional APCs, in the superior sagittal sinus. [89Zr]-labeled nanobodies show recruitment of macrophages/monocytes in non-lesional lung tissue in cynomolgus macaques after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as accumulation of the spike protein in both lung lesions and the nasal mucosa during infection. These results show the possibility of in vivo monitoring the quality and quantity of immune responses during the initial stages of an infection.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, triggering an acute proinflammatory response and chronic lung inflammation. Probiotic supplementation has shown promise in reducing the nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, diminishing symptom frequency and duration, and mitigating inflammation; thus, it is a potential strategy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the oral administration of the Lactobacillus plantarum GUANKE strain, a gram-positive bacterium originally isolated from a healthy individual, on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. We found that GUANKE significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary interstitial exudation in mice. The transcription of CCL2, TNFA, IL1B, IL6, and IL17C in the lungs was reduced. The protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 in the lungs were significantly lower in GUANKE-treated mice than in control mice. The viral load in GUANKE-treated mice was lower than that in saline-treated mice, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. L. plantarum GUANKE can decrease SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation in mice, suggesting its potential for use as an agent for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.


IMPORTANCE
Most otherwise healthy individuals develop only mild or moderate symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by current strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and virus replication is mainly confined to the upper respiratory tract; however, the virus can infect the lower respiratory tract and promote inflammation. Probiotic supplementation has been shown to reduce nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, reduce the overall number and duration of symptoms, and attenuate inflammation in clinical trials. We showed that a novel L. plantarum GUANKE strain alleviated SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia in mice. The transcription and production of inflammatory cytokines were suppressed, and GUANKE moderately reduced the viral load. L. plantarum GUANKE has the potential to become a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 or other viral respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive and yet incurable neurodegenerative condition characterized by loss of neuromelanin-containing dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. The contribution of non-neuronal cells to neuron degeneration in PD is receiving increasing attention. Here, we generated functional microglia-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from patients with PD associated to LRRK2 mutations, the most common cause of genetic PD, along with their gene-corrected isogenic controls and with iPSC from healthy donors. Microglia-like cells of either genotype did not induce neurodegeneration of healthy dopamine neurons in co-culture experiments. However, LRRK2-mutant microglia became hyperreactive upon LPS stimulation when compared with controls, as judged by cytokine expression profile, production of reactive oxygen species. We then tested α-synuclein and neuromelanin as potential endogenous stimuli for activating mutant microglia. Upon exposure to neuromelanin-containing particles, but not to preformed α-synuclein fibrils, LRRK2-mutant microglia induced the degeneration of healthy dopamine neurons, in a process that could be prevented by pre-treatment with the immunomodulatory drug ivermectin. Finally, the analysis of post-mortem midbrain tissue of LRRK2-PD patients found increased numbers of activated microglia cells in close contact with neuromelanin-containing neurons. Taken together, our findings uncover a potential critical role of neuromelanin-activated microglia in the context of PD progression, and provide an experimental model of PD to test new therapeutic targets.">

Testing of cellular function ex vivo to understand the aberrant immune response in MIS-C is limited. Despite strong Ab production in MIS-C, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing can remain positive for 4-6 wk postinfection. Therefore, we hypothesized that dysfunctional cell-mediated Ab responses downstream of Ab production may be responsible for delayed clearance of viral products in MIS-C. In MIS-C, monocytes were hyperfunctional for phagocytosis and cytokine production, whereas NK cells were hypofunctional for both killing and cytokine production. The decreased NK cell cytotoxicity correlated with an NK exhaustion marker signature and systemic IL-6 levels. Potentially providing a therapeutic option, cellular engagers of CD16 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins were found to rescue NK cell function in vitro. Taken together, our results reveal dysregulation in Ab-mediated cellular responses of myeloid and NK cells that likely contribute to the immune pathology of this disease.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus is alleged to enable a proinflammatory state, that leads to the activation of the coagulation and the complement cascade. In this study, we aimed to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with new onset of cTMA/aHUS in the Vienna TMA cohort and whether COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations would pose a greater risk of initial manifestation of cTMA/aHUS.


METHODS
We used the Vienna TMA cohort database to examine the prevalence of COVID-19 related and of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-related aHUS/cTMA during the first 3 years of the COVID-19 pandemic in a large single-center cohort.


RESULTS
Between March 2020 and May 2023, a total of 7 patients experienced their first aHUS/cTMA episode. No patient experienced a TMA relapse or more than one episode during the follow-up period. Three TMA episodes were attributable to either COVID-19 (n=1; 33%) or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=2; 66%), respectively. All three patients had systemic signs of TMA and TMA was confirmed by kidney biopsy in all cases. Among the seven patients we recorded five infections that triggered one TMA episode (20%) and 19 vaccinations triggered two TMA episodes (10%; p=0.52, odds ratio 0.47; 95% CI 0.04-8.39).


CONCLUSION
We speculate, that both SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations and COVID-19 episodes can represent a triggering factor for aHUS/cTMA episodes in (genetically) vulnerable individuals. However, COVID-19 might have a stronger association and might be a stronger trigger than the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The incidence of new aHUS cases did not differ from the pre-pandemic era in a large tertiary care centre cohort.">

        <tr id="Introduction The mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2-triggered complex alterations in immune cell activation and production of cytokines in lung tissue remain poorly understood, in part because of the limited use of adequate tissue models that simulate the structure and cell composition of the lung in vivo. We developed a novel ex vivo model of SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung explants, that maintains the intact tissue composition and the viral load for up to 7–10 days. Using this model, we studied cytokine production during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and methods Lung tissue was monitored for viability and cell composition using flow cytometry and histological analysis. SARS-CoV-2 infection was verified immunohistochemically, viral loads in tissue and culture medium were monitored by qPCR. A panel of 41 cytokines was measured in culture medium using xMAP technology. Results The explant lung tissue was viable and maintained viral infection that influenced the cytokine production. Elevated concentrations of G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO-a, IFN-g, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-3, MIP-1a, PDGF-AA, and VEGF, and decreased IL-1RA concentration were observed in infected tissue compared to non-infected tissue. Discussion Our results generally reflect the data obtained in COVID-19 patients. GRO-a, IFN-g, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MCP-3, and RANTES correlated with the viral load, forming a distinct pro-inflammatory cluster. Thus, our lung ex vivo model faithfully reproduces some aspects of cytokine alterations in COVID-19 patients at an early disease stage, making the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms more accessible and providing a potential platform for antiviral drug testing.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamic features of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binding to the cell membrane and entry cells is crucial for comprehending viral pathogenesis and transmission and facilitating the development of effective drugs against COVID-19. Herein, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to study the binding dynamics between the virus and cell membrane. Our findings revealed that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibited a slightly stronger affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor compared with the Delta variant and was significantly higher than the wild-type (WT). Using a real-time force-tracing technique, we quantified the dynamic parameters for a single SARS-CoV-2 VLP entry into cells, showing that approximately 200 ms and 60 pN are required. The parameters aligned with the analysis obtained from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. Additionally, the Omicron variant invades cells at a higher entry cell speed, smaller force, and higher probability. Furthermore, single-particle fluorescence tracking visually demonstrated clathrin-dependent endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 entry into A549 cells. The dynamic features of endocytosis provide valuable insights into the SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and possible intervention strategies targeting the viral infection process.">

We describe a fatal example of COVID pneumonia in a 9-year-old girl who presented with fever 10 months following the diagnosis of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). A chest computed tomography scan revealed left upper lobe lung consolidation and nodular airspace disease, and an initial SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (RT-PCR) was negative. A subsequent lung biopsy performed due to concern for relapsed ALCL demonstrated sheets of intra-alveolar and interstitial macrophages, and macrophage-rich fibrinous exudates. Immunohistochemical and in-situ hybridization stains confirmed these macrophages as the predominant SARS-CoV-2-infected cell type. Subsequent RT-PCR testing of upper and lower respiratory tract samples was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whole genome sequencing confirmed the presence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause systemic disease, including neurological complications, even after mild respiratory disease. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce neurovirulence through microglial activation in the brains of patients and experimentally inoculated animals, which are models representative for moderate to severe respiratory disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the neuroinvasive and neurovirulent potential of SARS-CoV-2 in intranasally inoculated ferrets, a model for subclinical to mild respiratory disease. The presence of viral RNA, histological lesions, virus-infected cells, and the number and surface area of microglia and astrocytes were investigated. Viral RNA was detected in various respiratory tissue samples by qPCR at 7 days post inoculation (dpi). Virus antigen was detected in the nasal turbinates of ferrets sacrificed at 7 dpi and was associated with inflammation. Viral RNA was detected in the brains of ferrets sacrificed 7 dpi, but in situ hybridization nor immunohistochemistry did not verify evidence of infection. Histopathological analysis of the brains showed no evidence for an influx of inflammatory cells. Despite this, we observed an increased number of Alzheimer type II astrocytes in the hindbrains of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated ferrets. Additionally, we detected an increased microglial activation in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, and a decrease in the astrocytic activation status in the white matter and hippocampus of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated ferrets. In conclusion, although showed that SARS-CoV-2 has limited neuroinvasive potential in this model for subclinical to mild respiratory disease, there is evidence for neurovirulent potential. This study highlights the value of this ferret model to study the neuropathogenecity of SARS-CoV-2 and reveals that a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect both microglia and astrocytes in different parts of the brain.">

Diversion of interferon IFN signaling was associated with increased expression of inflammatory markers, enhanced release of inflammatory cytokines, and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells. A shift from IFN-responsive germinal center B (GCB) cells towards CD69high GCB and atypical B cells corresponded to the formation of IgA in children while complement fixing IgG was dominant in adults.

However, due to the high complexity, non-linearity, multi-dimensionality, mixed anatomic sampling, and possible autocorrelation of available immune data, it is challenging to identify the components of the innate and adaptive immune response that drive viral elimination. Novel mathematical models and analytical approaches are required to synthesize contemporaneously gathered cytokine, transcriptomic, flow cytometry, antibody response, and viral load data into a coherent story of viral control, and ultimately to discriminate drivers of mild versus severe infection.We investigated a dataset describing innate, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell, and antibody responses in the lung during early and late stages of infection in immunologically naïve rhesus macaques. We used multi-model inference and ensemble modeling approaches from ecology and weather forecasting to compare and combine various competing models.Model outputs suggest that the innate immune response plays a crucial role in controlling early infection, while SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells correspond to later viral elimination, and anti-spike IgG antibodies do not impact viral dynamics. Among the numerous genes potentially contributing to the innate response, we identified IFI27 as most closely linked to viral load decline.

        <tr id="Millions of people have died and a worldwide economic catastrophe has been brought on by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may presently be treated with less than 10 antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir. The need for medical intervention due to sickness has led to unprecedented research efforts to study the biology of coronaviruses. Additionally, there is a strong likelihood that coronaviruses will cause pandemics in the future. All viruses cannot replicate optimally due to host restriction factors. Given that they are genetically more stable than viral targets and may be shared by similar viruses, these antiviral host factors provide appealing targets for antiviral treatment. The identification of antiviral host factors that are a component of human innate immunity and that prevent the completion of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle has been made possible by the deployment of several “omics” technologies. In this review, we provide an overview of the antiviral host factors that limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in this, which were mostly discovered using functional genetic and interactome screening. Important cellular mechanisms for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle are covered. Finally, we highlight host restriction factors that could be targeted by clinically approved molecules and the induction of these factors as potential antiviral therapies for COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease characterized by expanding demyelinating lesions, leading to severe and irreversible disability. The mechanisms driving lesion expansion, however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a multi-omics approach, we identified foamy microglia as primary contributors to the molecular profile of lesions and disease progression in secondary progressive MS. Lesions with foamy microglia are marked by the accumulation of cholesterol esters, bismonoacylglycerolphosphates (BMP), and oxylipins, along with high B-cell infiltration, increased levels of immunoglobulin G1, and elevated expression of Fcγ- and complement receptors. Lesions with foamy GPNMB+-microglia display markers of enhanced phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, lysosomal dysfunction, and antigen presentation, but lack classical pro-inflammatory markers. Our data suggest that sustained phagocytosis of myelin overwhelms microglial endo-lysosomal capacity, leading to lipid droplet and oxylipin formation. This microglial phenotype may induce further recruitment of adaptive immune cells, axonal damage, drive lesion expansion and prevent remyelination. Monoacylglycerol lipase, involved in producing oxylipin precursors, was identified as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt this cycle and prevent chronic lesion expansion.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increases the risk of adverse fetal outcomes during pregnancy. Maternal infection during pregnancy, particularly with cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B and C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus can have detrimental effects on both mother and fetus, potentially leading to adverse outcomes such as spontaneous abortion or neonatal infection. However, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the maternal-fetal interface remains poorly understood. In this study, we initially utilised immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical to investigate placental samples from pregnant women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first trimester. Our data indicate that infection in the first trimester induces an upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) levels at the maternal-fetal interface. Subsequently, single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics sequencing analyses reveal alterations in maternal-fetal interface. Remarkably, immune cells exhibited low expression levels of HIF possibly associated with immune activation. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate a gradual reduction in transcriptome and metabolic changes as gestation progressed beyond 12-16 weeks compared to samples obtained at 6-8 weeks gestation. Overall, our study suggests that early-stage SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first trimester leads to severe hypoxia and aberrant cell metabolism at the maternal-fetal interface which gradually resolves as pregnancy progresses. Nevertheless, these abnormal changes may have long-term implications for maternal-fetal interface development.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and changes to the host cellular landscape leading to neurological disease has been understudied. Through quantitative proteomic analysis of HPeV-3 infected neural organoids, we identified unique metabolic changes following HPeV-3 infection that indicate immunometabolic dysregulation. Protein and pathway analyses showed significant alterations in neurotransmission and potentially, neuronal excitotoxicity. Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and neurofilament light (NfL) confirmed glutamate excitotoxicity to be a key mechanism contributing to neuronal toxicity in HPeV-3 infection and can lead to apoptosis induced by caspase signaling. These insights are pivotal in delineating the metabolic landscape following severe HPeV-3 CNS infection and may identify potential host targets for therapeutic interventions.">

Although the direct infection caused by virus invasion is important for the pathobiology of COVID-19, the hyperinflammatory response and tissue injury are major contributors in critically ill patients. As a host sensor, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognizes multiple pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), producing various inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cell death signals, which are central to the inflammatory pathology observed in COVID-19. The objectives of this narrative review are to summarize the role of TLR2 activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and emphasize the importance of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in TLR2 activation.

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is linked to high mortality, primarily through an intense inflammatory response. Diacerein has emerged as a potential therapy for COVID-19 due to its potential impact in decreasing the inflammasome activation and coronavirus replication. This study aims to explore diacerein’s influence in inhibiting both viral replication and the inflammatory response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy volunteers and infected in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we carried out a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 14 participants allocated to diacerein (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) therapies every 12 h for 10 days. The primary endpoint was change in plasma markers of inflammasome activation (NLRP3, caspase-1, and gasdermin-D). Results In vitro protocols have shown that rhein, diacerein’s primary metabolite, decreased IL-1β secretion caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in human PBMCs (p < 0.05), and suppressed viral replication when administered either before or after the virus incubation (p < 0.05). This later effect was, at least partially, attributed to its inhibitory effect on 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro) and papain-like protease in the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) virus and in the phosphorylation of proteins related cytoskeleton network (p < 0.05). Diacerein-treated COVID-19 patients presented a smaller area under the curve for NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDM-D measured on days 2, 5, and 10 after hospitalization compared to those receiving a placebo (p < 0.05). Conclusion The indicated mechanisms of action of diacerein/rhein can reduce viral replication and mitigate the inflammatory response related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings are preliminary and require confirmation in clinical trials.">

One of these diseases is epilepsy, where the dysfunctional RAS plays a crucial role in the propagation of the disorder. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by utilizing the angiotensin-converting enzyme Type 2 (ACE2) receptor, which allows the virus to infect various cell types, including those in the lungs, nasopharynx, kidneys, lymph nodes, small intestine, stomach, spleen, and brain, leading to widespread organ damage. Once SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, it can lead to the overactivation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis. Consequently, higher levels of Ang II activate several deleterious pathways that promote inflammation, contributing to inflammatory responses in the body and exacerbating conditions such as seizures. Additionally, the excitatory effect of AT1R by Ang II excess due to ACE2 inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 or by the vaccine Spike protein may play a further role in the mechanism contributing to epilepsy.">

        <tr id="Problem COVID-19 during pregnancy is linked to increased maternal morbidity and a higher incidence of preterm births, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage (γH2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis, particularly affecting the elderly, who are more susceptible to severe outcomes. However, definitive parameters or mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in elderly people remain confused. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the mechanism behind the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals to severe COVID-19. We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry following protein extraction, digestion, and peptide labeling. We analyzed the transcriptome and proteome profiles of young and aged mice and discovered that aged mice exhibited elevated baseline levels of inflammation and tissue damage repair. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged mice showed increased antiviral and inflammatory responses; however, these responses were weaker than those in young mice, with significant complement and coagulation cascade responses. In summary, our study demonstrates that the increased vulnerability of the elderly to severe COVID-19 can be attributed to an attenuated antiviral response and the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades.">

        <tr id="Coronaviruses (CoV) emerge suddenly from animal reservoirs to cause novel diseases in new hosts. Discovered in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in camels in the Middle East and is continually causing local outbreaks and epidemics. While all three newly emerging human CoV from past 20 years (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) cause respiratory disease, each CoV has unique host interactions that drive differential pathogeneses. To better understand the virus and host interactions driving lethal MERS-CoV infection, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics analysis of sublethal and lethal MERS-CoV infection in mice. Significant differences were observed in body weight loss, virus titers and acute lung injury among lethal and sub-lethal virus doses. Virus induced apoptosis of type I and II alveolar epithelial cells suggest that loss or dysregulation of these key cell populations was a major driver of severe disease. Omics analysis suggested differential pathogenesis was multi-factorial with clear differences among innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as those that regulate lung epithelial homeostasis. Infection of mice lacking functional T and B-cells showed that adaptive immunity was important in controlling viral replication but also increased pathogenesis. In summary, we provide a high-resolution host response atlas for MERS-CoV infection and disease severity. Multi-omics studies of viral pathogenesis offer a unique opportunity to not only better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease but also to identify genes and pathways that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention all of which is important for our future pandemic preparedness. Importance Emerging coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV cause a range of disease outcomes in humans from asymptomatic, moderate and severe respiratory disease which can progress to death but the factors causing these disparate outcomes remain unclear. Understanding host responses to mild and life-threatening infection provides insight into virus-host networks within and across organ systems that contribute to disease outcomes. We used multi-omics approaches to comprehensively define the host response to moderate and severe MERS-CoV infection. Severe respiratory disease was associated with dysregulation of the immune response. Key lung epithelial cell populations that are essential for lung function get infected and die. Mice lacking key immune cell populations experienced greater virus replication but decreased disease severity implicating the immune system in both protective and pathogenic roles in the response to MERS-CoV. These data could be utilized to design new therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathways that contribute to severe disease.">

 Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 virus through wastewater has been adopted as an effective surveillance approach for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the interplay between this virus and the human microbiome, this study examined the longitudinal co-dynamics between the virus and the microbiome across various sewage samples representing diverse demographic populations in Houston.



 We collected wastewater through manholes and the viral RNA levels of SARS-CoV-2 were monitored from December 2020 to 2021. The sampling sites serve nursing homes, rehabs, and shelters across the metro Houston area, respectively. The viral load was analyzed by the gold standard RT-qPCR method, and the microbiome load and composition by qPCR and amplicon sequencing of the 16S and ITS DNA.



 Preliminary results on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load indicated diverse trends among sampling sites. These viral trends could be classified into three basic categories: flat, up and down, and up, suggesting disparities in COVID-19 infections among communities. A full analysis of the microbiome is underway, but a preview of the data revealed that bacteria and fungi commonly seen in the human gut predominated the wastewater samples. This paves the way to exploring the link between COVID-19 and the gut microbiome, which could shed light on the observed COVID-19 disparities.



 As a proof-of-concept, our sewage bio-monitoring program was able to capture COVID-19 viral, bacterial, and fungal signals longitudinally from manholes serving a wide range of communities. Because these signals are predominantly human-associated, further analysis of these signals could offer insight on COVID-19 related disparities among these communities.

Postmortem liver biopsy showed sparse SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages with extensive ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) speck-positive hepatocytes, correlating with elevated circulating ASC specks and inflammatory cytokines, and depleted blood monocyte subsets, indicating widespread liver inflammasome activation.

        <tr id="The primary challenge posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is COVID-19-related mortality, often exacerbated by additional medical complications, such as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Up to half of COVID-19 patients experience kidney complications, with those facing acute respiratory failure and kidney injury having the worst overall prognosis. Despite the significant impact of CAKI on COVID-19-related mortality and its enduring effects in long COVID, the underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of CAKI remain elusive. In this study, we identified a functional relationship between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein and inflammation-driven apoptotic death of renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with CAKI. We demonstrate in vitro that ORF3a independently induces renal cell-specific apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the elevation of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and the activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-6) production. By examining kidney tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-ACE2 transgenic mice, we observed a similar correlation between ORF3a-induced cytopathic changes and kidney injury. This correlation was further validated through reconstitution of the ORF3a effects via direct adenoviral injection into mouse kidneys. Through medicinal analysis, we identified a natural compound, glycyrrhizin (GL4419), which not only blocks viral replication in renal cells, but also mitigates ORF3a-induced renal cell death by inhibiting activation of a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, leading to a reduction of KIM-1. Moreover, ORF3a interacts with HMGB1. Overproduction or downregulation of hmgb1 expression results in correlative changes in renal cellular KIM-1 response and respective cytokine production, implicating a crucial role of HMGB1 in ORF3a-inflicted kidney injuries. Our data suggest a direct functional link between ORF3a and kidney injury, highlighting ORF3a as a unique therapeutic target contributing to CAKI.


IMPORTANCE
The major challenge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the pandemic is COVID-19-related mortality, which has tragically claimed millions of lives. COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are often exacerbated by pre-existing medical conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), or the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, collectively known as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Patients who experience acute respiratory failure with CAKI have the poorest clinical outcomes, including increased mortality. Despite these alarming clinical findings, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying causes of CAKI. Our study establishes a direct correlation between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral ORF3a protein and kidney injury induced by ORF3a linking to CAKI. This functional relationship was initially observed in our clinical studies of COVID-19 patients with AKI and was further validated through animal and in vitro cellular studies, either by expressing ORF3a alone or in the context of viral infection. By elucidating this functional relationship and its underlying mechanistic pathways, our research deepens the understanding of COVID-19-associated kidney diseases and presents potential therapeutic avenues to address the healthcare challenges faced by individuals with underlying conditions.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by demyelinating lesions 1. Lesion expansion contributes to progression and increased disability, while remyelination can recover neurological deficits. However, mechanisms driving lesion dynamics are largely unclear, hindering the development of effective therapeutics. We propose that distinct states of microglia are involved in lesion expansion and remyelination 2,3. Using Stereo-seq, an RNA capture based high-resolution spatial transcriptomics technology with single-cell resolution, on post-mortem human brain tissue, we compared mixed active/inactive lesions with lipid-laden foamy microglia with lesions containing ramified microglia. We identified distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lesion activity and remyelination, linked to microglia phenotypes and states. Lesions with foamy microglia were characterized by elevated immune activation, increased lymphocyte densities, upregulated immunoglobulin production (IGHG1, IGHG3), increased complement system activity, indication of iron dysregulation (FTL, FTH1), and increased demyelination. In contrast, lesions with ramified microglia exhibited gene expression profiles indicative of myelin stability (ABCA2, QKI) and neuro-axonal protection, fostering an environment conducive to repair and remyelination. Our findings highlight the role of microglial states in lesion expansion and repair in MS and offer promising avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing MS disability progression.">

Mitochondria are vital for cellular energy provision and resilience against age-related macromolecule damage accumulation. They manage energy allocation in cells, activating adaptive responses and stress signals such as redox imbalance and innate immunity activation. As organisms age, mitochondrial function diminishes. Aging and obesity, linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, compromise the antiviral response, affecting the release of interferons, and worsening COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID has been associated with altered energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation derived from mitochondrial dysfunction.

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat to public health globally. Infection in some susceptible individuals causes life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI/ARDS) and/or death. Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a C-type lectin expressed in the lung and other mucosal tissues, and it plays a critical role in host defense against various pathogens. The human SP-A genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) are highly polymorphic and comprise several common genetic variants, i.e., SP-A1 (variants 6A2, 6A4) and SP-A2 (variants 1A0, 1A3). Here, we elucidated the differential antiviral and immunoregulatory roles of SP-A variants in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Six genetically-modified mouse lines, expressing both hACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and individual SP-A variants: (hACE2/6A2 (6A2), hACE2/6A4 (6A4), hACE2/1A0 (1A0), and hACE2/1A3(1A3), one SP-A knockout (hACE2/SP-A KO (KO) and one hACE2/mouse SP-A (K18) mice, were challenged intranasally with 103 PFU SARS-CoV-2 or saline (Sham). Infected KO and 1A0 mice had more weight loss and mortality compared to other mouse lines. Relative to other infected mouse lines, a more severe ALI was observed in KO, 1A0, and 6A2 mice. Reduced viral titers were generally observed in the lungs of infected SP-A mice relative to KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation in genes that play central roles in immune responses such as MyD88, Stat3, IL-18, and Jak2 in the lungs of KO and 1A0 mice. However, Mapk1 was significantly downregulated in 6A2 versus 1A0 mice. Analysis of biological pathways identified those involved in lung host defense and innate immunity, including pathogen-induced cytokine, NOD1/2, and Trem1 signaling pathways. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, levels of cytokines and chemokines such as G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-1β were comparatively higher in the lungs and sera of KO and 1A0 mice with the highest mortality rate. These findings demonstrate that human SP-A variants differentially modulate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and disease severity by differentially inhibiting viral infectivity and regulating immune-related gene expressions.">

        <tr id="JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infects the majority of the population and initially establishes a persistent but asymptomatic infection of the kidneys. In healthy individuals, the infection remains controlled by the host immune system, but for individuals experiencing prolonged immunosuppression, the infection can reactivate and spread to the brain, where it causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Currently, there are no approved therapies to treat PML, and affected individuals suffer rapid motor weakness and cognitive deterioration. To identify novel therapeutic treatments for JCPyV infection, receptor agonists/antagonists identified in a previously published drug screen were evaluated for their antiviral properties. Seven drugs were selected and validated using infectivity assays, and the mechanism of inhibition was further explored for G protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-associated inhibitors due to the role of the GPCR 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) in JCPyV entry. The inhibitors cetirizine and paroxetine both reduced infection early in the JCPyV infectious cycle. Paroxetine specifically reduced viral internalization through altering the receptor density of 5-HT2CR, inhibiting β-arrestin recruitment to the receptor, and reducing MAPK signaling through ERK. These findings highlight the potential of receptor signaling and viral entry mechanisms as possible targets for antiviral drug development. Further, this research suggests that FDA-approved receptor agonists/antagonists currently used to treat other medical conditions could be repurposed into antivirals for the possible treatment of JCPyV infection and the fatal disease PML.">

        <tr id="Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung has been extensively studied, the molecular regulators and targets of the host-cell programs hijacked by the virus in distinct human airway epithelial cell populations remain poorly understood. This is in part ascribed to the use of non-primary cell systems, overreliance on single-cell gene expression profiling that not ultimately reflect protein activity and bias toward the downstream effects rather than their mechanistic determinants. Here we address these issues by network-based analysis of single cell transcriptomic profiles of pathophysiologically relevant human adult basal, ciliated and secretory cells to identify master regulator (MR) protein modules controlling their SARS-CoV-2-mediated reprogramming. This uncovered chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathway as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR analyses as components of the host response collectively or selectively activated in these cells. Large-scale perturbation assays, using a clinically-relevant drug library, identified 11 drugs able to invert the entire MR signature activated by SARS-CoV-2 in these cell types. Leveraging MR analysis and perturbational profiles of human primary cells, represents a novel mechanism-based approach and resource that can be directly generalized to interrogate signatures of other airway conditions for drug prioritization.">

        <tr id="While the World Health Organization has declared the end of the SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency, studies related to corona viruses are still under course. As of 2024, the severity of COVID-19 has diminished with current treatments and vaccinations. However, individuals can still face severe complications, highlighting the importance of ongoing research into innovative treatments for current and future coronavirus-related diseases. This study approaches the mechanism of viral entrance into the host cells and the current evidence on the use of sulfhydryl groups for the COVID-19 treatment. Certain thiol drugs, a key contributor to inflammatory processes, exhibit both viral inhibition properties and the potential to regulate cellular oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. Herein, we developed biocompatible thiol-functionalized carbon dots (CDs) and investigated the correlation between the number of thiols and pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and anti-inflammatory response. The free-radical scavenging experiment and the ROS cellular assay indicate that thiolated CDs serve as effective reducing agents and potential regulators of cellular oxidative stress. The CDs also demonstrated good cell viability alongside significant antiviral capabilities, with inhibition levels up to 60.4%. Furthermore, the flow cytometry results suggest that in an inflammatory environment, the presence of thiolated CDs promotes an anti-inflammatory response. Overall, the results demonstrate a strong correlation between the number of thiols and the increased efficacy observed across experiments, presenting thiolated CDs as promising candidates to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Mucosal barrier integrity is vital for homeostasis with commensal organisms while preventing pathogen invasion. We unexpectedly found that fungal-induced immunosurveillance enhances resistance to fungal outgrowth and tissue invasion by remodeling the oral mucosal epithelial barrier in mouse models of adult and neonatal Candida albicans colonization. Epithelial subset expansion and tissue remodeling were dependent on interleukin-22 (IL-22) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, through a non-canonical receptor complex composed of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) coupled with IL-22RA1 and IL-10RB. Immunosurveillance-induced epithelial remodeling was restricted to the oral mucosa, whereas barrier architecture was reset once fungal-specific immunity developed. Collectively, these findings identify fungal-induced transient mucosal remodeling as a critical determinant of resistance to mucosal fungal infection during early stages of microbial colonization.">

We found that the myeloid cell populations were significantly changed by SIVE. In SIVE microglia-like cells express high levels of chemoattractants capable of recruiting highly activated CAM-like cells to the site of infection/inflammation. A unique population of microglia-like cells was found in which the chromatin accessibility of genes diverged from their RNA expression. Additionally, we observed a dramatic shift of upstream gene regulators and their targets in brain myeloid cells during SIVE. In summary, this study further uncovers the transcriptome, gene regulatory events and potential roles of different brain myeloid phenotypes in SIVE.">

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, advanced age has emerged as a major predictor of disease severity. Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19. Author summary In this study, we investigated why older age is linked to more severe COVID-19 outcomes by comparing the progression of the disease in young (2 months) and elderly (15-22 months) K18(hACE2) mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. After exposing both groups to the virus, we assessed various factors such as viral loads, immune responses, and lipid profiles in the lungs at different time points. Our findings revealed that elderly mice struggled to clear the virus by day 7 post-infection, leading to higher mortality rates and poorer recovery compared to younger mice. Aged mice showed weaker immune responses, with reduced production of key antiviral proteins like IFNg and certain chemokines. Lipid analysis also highlighted differences in molecules involved in immune regulation and lung protection, such as decreased levels of pro-resolving lipids and increased lipids associated with lung injury. These results suggest that older mice have a compromised antiviral defense, which could inform new therapeutic approaches for elderly patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may have diminished serologic response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination and increased risk for subsequent severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We sought to describe outcomes among those who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination, characterize SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 1 year post-vaccination, and identify factors associated with durable serologic response.


METHODS
We recruited children with IBD who received ≥2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and prospectively collected data on (1) demographics, IBD characteristics, and therapy and (2) SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, testing, and infection symptoms. Serum was obtained for measurement of anti-receptor-binding domain IgG antibodies following a 2-part immunization at 12 and 52 weeks.


RESULTS
We enrolled 298 participants (mean age 11.9 ± 3.82, 50% female, 67% Crohn's disease). Symptomatic COVID-19 infection after vaccination occurred in half of the participants, although only 2 (1%) required hospitalization. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was associated with higher likelihood of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5-5.0; P = .001). Nearly all participants (99%) had detectable antibody at Week 52. Children aged 1-5 years had lower 52-week antibody level compared to older children (P = .04), as did those on anti-TNF-α therapy (P = .007) and those who received only 2 vaccine doses prior to Week 52 (P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provides lasting serologic response and protection against severe COVID-19 for most children with IBD, despite the use of lower vaccine doses in younger children and wide-ranging classes of immunosuppressive therapies.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in cerebral vascular endothelial cells (CVECs), has been currently identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2.


METHODS
We specifically induced injury to ACE2-expressing CVECs in mice and evaluated the effects of such targeted damage through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive behavioral tests. In parallel, we recruited a single-center cohort of COVID-19 survivors and further assessed their brain microvascular injury based on cognition and emotional scales, cranial MRI scans, and blood proteomic measurements.


RESULTS
Here, we show an array of pathological and behavioral alterations characteristic of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in mice that targeted damage to ACE2-expressing CVECs, and COVID-19 survivors. These CSVD-like manifestations persist for at least 7 months post-recovery from COVID-19.


DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may induce cerebral small vessel damage with persistent sequelae, underscoring the imperative for heightened clinical vigilance in mitigating or treating SARS-CoV-2-mediated cerebral endothelial injury throughout infection and convalescence.


HIGHLIGHTS
Cerebral small vessel disease-associated changes were observed after targeted damage to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-expressing cerebral vascular endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 may induce cerebral small vessel damage with persistent sequelae. Clinical vigilance is needed in preventing SARS-CoV-2-induced cerebral endothelial damage during infection and recovery.">

        <tr id="Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to permanent motor and sensory loss that is exacerbated by intraspinal inflammation that persists months to years after injury. After SCI, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infiltrate the lesion to aid in myelin-rich debris clearance. During debris clearance, MDMs adopt a proinflammatory phenotype that exacerbates neurodegeneration and hinders recovery. The underlying cause of the lipid-mediated MDM phenotype shift is unclear. Our previous work suggests that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) plays a role in the proinflammatory potentiating effect of myelin on macrophages in vitro. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) frees arachidonic acid from phospholipids, generating eicosanoids that play an important role in inflammation, immunity, and host defense. cPLA2 is expressed in macrophages along with multiple other cell types after SCI, and cPLA2 inhibition has been reported to both reduce and exacerbate secondary injury pathology recovery. The role of cPLA2 in MDMs after SCI is not fully understood. We hypothesize that cPLA2 activation in MDMs after SCI contributes to secondary injury. Here, we report that cPLA2 plays an important role in the myelin-induced inflammatory macrophage phenotype in vitro using macrophages derived from cPLA2 knockout bone marrow. Furthermore, to investigate the role of cPLA2 in MDMs after SCI, we generated female bone marrow chimeras using cPLA2 knock-out donors and assessed locomotor recovery using the Basso Mouse Scale (BMS), CatWalk gait analysis system, and horizontal ladder task over six weeks. We also evaluated tissue sparing and intralesional axon density six weeks after injury. cPLA2 KO chimeras did not display altered locomotor recovery or tissue pathology after SCI compared to WT chimera controls. These data suggest that although cPLA2 plays a critical role in myelin-mediated potentiation of proinflammatory macrophage activation in vitro, it may not contribute to secondary injury pathology in vivo after SCI.">

COVID-19 is caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus from the Coronaviridae family, responsible
for developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). Its emergence in 2019
presented several challenges to global health. The virus can infect host cells using the ACE2 receptor,
and after infection, several clinical manifestations appear, ranging from mild symptoms to death.
One approach that has shown promising results is convalescent plasma since convalescent plasma
(CP) consists of a concentrate of immunoglobulins in the blood of patients recently infected with the
coronavirus for those currently infected. Therefore, this therapy uses antibodies in the plasma to
neutralize the virus. This literature review aims to evaluate the efficacy of CP therapy in symptomatic
COVID-19 patients by analyzing clinical trials and studies published between 2020 and 2023.
Therefore, the search identified studies in which the majority reported the efficacy of using convalescent
plasma to treat and alleviate the clinical condition of patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
Important factors influence the efficacy of CP therapy, such as the timing of administration and the
severity of the disease. Early administration in mild and moderate cases has shown promise. Furthermore,
molecular docking analysis suggests that antibodies can cause conformational changes in
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, raising the hypothesis that using CP may interfere with viral entry
into host cells.

        <tr id="Background. Currently, the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute damage to organs and systems caused by coronavirus infection have been studied quite fully, but the mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of long COVID have not yet been accurately described. The mechanisms of persistence of a number of symptoms in patients who have had COVID-19 and the role of systemic inflammation and endotoxemia markers in it remain a understudied aspect and a promising direction for further studying.The aim of the study. To assess the markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability and endothelial dysfunction in patients with long COVID at the stage of health resort treatment.Methods. The study included 32 patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection and were undergoing health resort treatment in the pulmonology department of the I.M. Sechenov Academic Research Institute for Physical Therapy, Medical Climatology and Rehabilitation. We also selected a control group (n = 20). All patients underwent peripheral blood analysis to detect the levels of markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability, endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstrictor agents: C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LPB), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), zonulin, bactericidal/ permeability-increasing protein (BPI), vasopressors of angiotensin 2 and endothelin (EDN1).Results. Patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection had a statistically significant increase in the levels of CRP (3.4 [2.56; 4.0] mg/l), LBP (18.46 [14.0; 25.5] ng/ml), tPA (0.07 [0.02; 0.32] ng/ml), angiotensin 2 (133.3 [63.0; 503.7] pg/ml) and a decrease in the level of BPI (1576 [276; 3588] pg/ml) (p < 0.05).Conclusion. A statistically significant increase in markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxinemia, and vasoconstrictor agents in patients with long COVID indicates an imbalance in endotoxin-binding and endotoxin-releasing systems in patients who have had coronavirus infection. Further study of the described markers is necessary to improve approaches to long-term personalized therapy for this category of patients.">

        <tr id="Systemic inflammation can lead to neuroinflammation with acute consequences such as delirium and long-lasting deleterious effects including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disease progression. Here we show that the activation status of the transcription factor Nrf2 in endothelial cells is a critical regulator of this process. We found that peripheral inflammation caused infiltration of macrophages, microglial activation and inflammatory reactive astrogliosis, all of which could be prevented by RTA-404, an activator of the transcription factor Nrf2 and close structural relative of the recently FDA-approved Nrf2 activator RTA-408 (Omaveloxolone). To identify the key cellular mediator(s), we generated an endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 knockout mouse. Strikingly, the effects of RTA-404 on brain endothelial activation and downstream neuroinflammatory events was abolished by endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 deletion. This places endothelial cell Nrf2 as a peripherally accessible therapeutic target to reduce the CNS-adverse consequences of systemic inflammation.">

        <tr id="While several viral infections have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the mechanism(s) through which they promote disease has remained almost entirely elusive. This study investigated the impact of common, acute viral infections prior to disease onset on ALS progression in the SOD1G93A mouse model. A single sublethal infection prior to onset of ALS clinical signs was associated with markedly accelerated ALS disease progression characterized by rapid loss of hindlimb function. Prior infection resulted in gliosis in the lumbar spine and upregulation of transcriptional pathways involved in inflammatory responses, metabolic dysregulation, and muscular dysfunction. Therapeutic suppression of gliosis with an anti-inflammatory small molecule, or administration of a direct-acting antiviral, was associated with significantly improved ALS clinical signs, akin to what was observed in uninfected animals. This study provides causal and mechanistic evidence that the immune response elicited by acute viral infections may be an important etiological factor that alters ALS disease trajectory, and provides insight into novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for ALS. One Sentence Summary Acute viral infection with influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 accelerates the progression of ALS in SOD1G93A mice.">

        <tr id="Chronic infections drive a CD8 T cell program termed T cell exhaustion, characterized by reduced effector functions. While cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell exhaustion have been extensively studied, the impact of the metabolic environment in which exhausted CD8 T cells (Tex) operate remains less clear. Using untargeted metabolomics and the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model we investigated systemic metabolite changes early and late following acute versus chronic viral infections. We identified distinct short-term and persistent metabolite shifts, with the most significant differences occurring transiently during the acute phase of the sustained infection. This included nutrient changes that were independent of viral loads and partially associated with CD8 T cell-induced anorexia and lipolysis. One remarkable observation was the elevation of medium- and long-chain fatty acid (FA) and acylcarnitines during the early phase after chronic infection. During this time, virus-specific CD8 T cells from chronically infected mice exhibited increased lipid accumulation and uptake compared to their counterparts from acute infection, particularly stem-like Tex (TexSTEM), a subset that generates effector-like TexINT which directly limit viral replication. Notably, only TexSTEM increased oxidative metabolism and ATP production upon FA exposure. Consistently, short-term reintroduction of FA during late chronic infection exclusively improved TexSTEM mitochondrial fitness, percentages and numbers. This treatment, however, also reduced TexINT, resulting in compromised viral control. Our study offers a valuable resource for investigating the role of specific metabolites in regulating immune responses during acute and chronic viral infections and highlights the potential of long-chain FA to influence TexSTEM and viral control during a protracted infection. Significance This study examines systemic metabolite changes during acute and chronic viral infections. Notably, we identified an early, transient nutrient shift in chronic infection, marked by an increase in medium- and long-chain fatty acid related species. Concomitantly, a virus-specific stem-like T cell population, essential for maintaining other T cells, displayed high lipid avidity and was capable of metabolizing exogenous fatty acids. Administering fatty acids late in chronic infection, when endogenous lipid levels had normalized, expanded this stem-like T cell population and enhanced their mitochondrial fitness. These findings highlight the potential role of fatty acids in regulating stem-like T cells in chronic settings and offer a valuable resource for studying other metabolic signatures in both acute and persistent infections.">

Viruses rapidly adapt and evade human immune systems, complicating the development of effective antiviral countermeasures. Consequently, the need for novel antivirals resilient to viral mutations is urgent. In this study, we developed a CRISPR-Cas13b system to target SARS-CoV-2.

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a poliomyelitis-like illness causing paralysis in young children. However, mechanisms of paralysis are unclear, and antiviral therapies are lacking. To better understand EV-D68 disease, we inoculated newborn mice intracranially to assess viral tropism, virulence, and immune responses. Wild-type (WT) mice inoculated intracranially with a neurovirulent strain of EV-D68 showed infection of spinal cord neurons and developed paralysis. Spinal tissue from infected mice revealed increased levels of chemokines, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and T cells relative to controls, suggesting that immune cell infiltration influences pathogenesis. To define the contribution of cytokine-mediated immune cell recruitment to disease, we inoculated mice lacking CCR2, a receptor for several EV-D68-upregulated cytokines, or RAG1, which is required for lymphocyte maturation. WT, Ccr2-/-, and Rag1-/- mice had comparable viral titers in spinal tissue. However, Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice had significantly less paralysis relative to WT mice. Consistent with impaired T cell recruitment to sites of infection in Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice, antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from WT mice diminished paralysis. These results indicate that immune cell recruitment to the spinal cord promotes EV-D68-associated paralysis and illuminate new targets for therapeutic intervention. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Prenatal immune challenges pose significant risks to human embryonic brain and eye development. However, we still lack knowledge about the safe usage of anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy. While human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC)-derived brain organoid models have started to explore functional consequences upon viral stimulation, these models commonly lack microglia. Yet, microglia are susceptible to and promote inflammation and will influence the effects. Here, we generate hIPSC-derived microglia precursor cells and assemble them into retinal organoids to dissect their interplay with the developing nervous system and expose them to the immunostimulant poly(I:C). We first identified successful hIPSC-derived microglia (iMG) integration into the retinal organoid at the time when the outer plexiform layer forms. To improve ganglion cell surveillance, we adapted the retinal organoid model and found that the ganglion cell number significantly decreased only with iMG presence. While poly(I:C) exposure alters the iMG phenotype, it does not hinder their interaction with ganglion cells. Furthermore, iMG significantly enhances the supernatant’s inflammatory secretome and increases retinal cell proliferation. Simultaneous exposure with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen dampens the poly(I:C)-mediated changes of the iMG phenotype and ameliorates cell proliferation. Remarkably, while poly(I:C) disrupts neuronal calcium dynamics independent of iMG, ibuprofen rescues this effect only if iMG are present. This effect depends on cyclooxygenase 1 in microglia and cyclooxygenase 2, common NSAID targets. These findings underscore the importance of microglia in the context of prenatal immune challenges and provide insight into the mechanisms by which ibuprofen exerts its protective effects during embryonic development.">

        <tr id="Objectives: Durable immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are generally observed in previously infected individuals. Immunocompromised individuals may show less durable responses. Investigation of immune responses is needed to inform individuals on whether measures such as boosters may be advisable. Methods: Three SARS-CoV-2 ELISA tests were utilized to monitor responses in 82 individuals in the United States [nucleocapsid protein (N)-specific antibody and spike RBD (receptor binding domain)-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb), and spike-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release by T cells]. Case reports highlight results for this cohort; 21 previously infected and vaccinated, 57 never infected and vaccinated, 2 breakthrough infections post-vaccination and 2 neither infected nor vaccinated. Results: The vaccines generated nAb responses in naive donors, and in previously infected individuals with waning responses, immunosuppression, or weak infection responses. The cutoff for the nAb potency was established at 41.1 IU/mL when calibrated to the WHO International Standard (IU) using the NCI SARS-CoV-2 Standard. This relationship has the critical potential to allow comparisons of nAb measures to be utilized in studies of correlates of protection. Further, previously infected donors demonstrated robust T cell activity, while vaccinated and infection-naive individuals had lower responses. Conclusions: Calibrated ELISA tests may aid broad vaccination strategies given their low cost and wide accessibility. Additional studies that relate measures of the adaptive responses to immunity from serious disease and infection are needed.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly affected global healthcare, chal¬lenging both medical and dental practices. Emerging in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 quick¬ly escalated into a pandemic, leading the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency. This review explores the pathogenesis, transmission, systemic health effects, and oral health implications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, a beta coronavirus, spreads mainly through respiratory droplets, with aerosols and fomites also playing roles in its transmission. The virus binds strongly to the ACE2 receptor, present in res¬piratory, myocardial, and oral and nasal mucosa cells, facilitating infection and replication. The ensuing im¬mune response, critical for viral clearance, can lead to a hyperinflammatory ‚cytokine storm‘, causing severe complications like ARDS and multi-organ failure. Clinically, COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic cases to severe systemic involvement, affecting cardiovascular, neurological, renal, and hematological systems. Oral health issues such as dysgeusia and xerostomia are increasingly noted, indicating the virus‘s broader impact. This review emphasizes the need for stringent infection control in dental practices, including enhanced pro¬tective measures and procedural adaptations. A multidisciplinary approach integrating oral health into broad¬er COVID-19 strategies is crucial. Continued research is essential to understand the long-term implications of COVID-19 and to refine preventive and therapeutic strategies, shaping future healthcare policies.">

        <tr id="MPOX virus (MPXV), formerly known as monkeypox virus, led to a rapidly evolving pandemic starting May 2022, with over 90,000 cases reported beyond the African continent. This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of IFN-α2a. qPCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-α2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced amounts of viral antigen production and of released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohematogenous route for replication and/or intra-host dissemination.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat, particularly to vulnerable populations. The emergence of new variants necessitates the development of treatments and vaccines that induce both humoral and cellular immunity. This study aimed to identify potentially immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides and to explore the intricate host–pathogen interactions involving peripheral immune responses, memory profiles, and various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Using in silico and experimental methods, we identified several CD8-restricted SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are either poorly studied or have previously unreported immunogenicity: fifteen from the Spike and three each from non-structural proteins Nsp1-2-3-16. A Spike peptide, LA-9, demonstrated a 57% response rate in ELISpot assays using PBMCs from 14 HLA-A*02:01 positive, vaccinated, and mild-COVID-19 recovered subjects, indicating its potential for diagnostics, research, and multi-epitope vaccine platforms. We also found that younger individuals, with fewer vaccine doses and longer intervals since infection, showed lower anti-Spike (ELISA) and anti-Wuhan neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus assay), higher naïve T cells, and lower central memory, effector memory, and CD4hiCD8low T cells (flow cytometry) compared to older subjects. In our cohort, a higher prevalence of Vδ2-γδ and DN T cells, and fewer naïve CD8 T cells, seemed to correlate with strong cellular and lower anti-NP antibody responses and to associate with Omicron infection, absence of confusional state, and habitual sporting activity.">

        <tr id="Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis and meningitis are potential central nervous system (CNS) complications following primary VZV infection or reactivation. With Type-I interferon (IFN) signalling being an important first line cellular defence mechanism against VZV infection by the peripheral tissues, we here investigated the triggering of innate immune responses in a human neural-like environment. For this, we established and characterised 5-month matured hiPSC-derived neurospheroids (NSPHs) containing neurons and astrocytes. Subsequently, NSPHs were infected with reporter strains of VZV (VZVeGFP-ORF23) or Sendai virus (SeVeGFP), with the latter serving as an immune-activating positive control. Live cell and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated VZVeGFP-ORF23 infection throughout the NSPHs, while SeVeGFP infection was limited to the outer NSPH border. Next, NanoString digital transcriptomics revealed that SeVeGFP-infected NSPHs activated a clear Type-I IFN response, while this was not the case in VZVeGFP-ORF23-infected NSPHs. Moreover, the latter displayed a strong suppression of genes related to IFN signalling and antigen presentation, as further demonstrated by suppression of IL-6 and CXCL10 production, failure to upregulate Type-I IFN activated anti-viral proteins (Mx1, IFIT2 and ISG15), as well as reduced expression of CD74, a key-protein in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. Finally, even though VZVeGFP-ORF23-infection seems to be immunologically ignored in NSPHs, its presence does result in the formation of stress granules upon long-term infection, as well as disruption of cellular integrity within the infected NSPHs. Concluding, in this study we demonstrate that 5-month matured hiPSC-derived NSPHs display functional innate immune reactivity towards SeV infection, and have the capacity to recapitulate the strong immune evasive behaviour towards VZV.">

        <tr id="In EAE, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, immunization with MOG autoantigen results in the generation of Th1/Th17 T cells in the periphery. MOG-specific T cells then invade into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuronal demyelination. Microglia, innate immune cells in the CNS are known to regulate various neuronal diseases. However, the role of microglia in EAE has remained elusive. BRD4 is a BET protein expressed in microglia, whether BRD4 in microglia contributes to EAE has not been determined. We show that EAE pathology was markedly reduced with microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout (cKO). In these mice, microglia- T cell interactions were greatly reduced, leading to the lack of T cell reactivation. Microglia specific transcriptome data showed downregulation of genes required for interaction with and reactivation of T cells in Brd4 cKO samples. In summary, BRD4 plays a critical role in regulating microglia function in normal and EAE CNS. Summary This study demonstrates that in a EAE model, microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were defective in expressing genes required for microglia- T cells interaction and those involved in neuroinflammation, and demyelination resulting in fewer CNS T cell invasion and display marked reduction in EAE pathology.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants presents challenges in global efforts to transition from the pandemic to an endemic stage. The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is pivotal for cell entry, exhibits significant mutations in its variants, potentially affecting infectivity and therapeutic efficacy. Recent findings indicate upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, a key target in cancer therapy, by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to investigate the activity of the EGFR pathway against SARS-CoV-2 variants and to assess the inhibitory effects of EGFR inhibitors using SARS-CoV variant pseudoviral particles to guide future therapeutic strategies. Omicron variant SARS-CoV pseudoviral particles exhibited heightened infectivity in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-expressing HEK293 and A549 lung cancer cells accompanied by increased EGFR pathway activation in infected cells. Using the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, osimertinib, we observed a reduction in viral infection rates in hACE2-HEK293 and A549 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 variant pseudoviral particles. We conducted further experiments to confirm that the reduction in infection efficacy with osimertinib treatment was not associated to a decrease in cell viability. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect of osimertinib in cell lines was corroborated in a spheroid cell culture model derived from hACE2-A549 cells. These findings suggest the potential application of EGFR-targeted antiviral therapy against highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. IMPORTANCE The emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants is concerning as vaccines designed for one variant need not essentially protect against other novel variants. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify therapies that can act against multiple novel variants that have heightened virulence compared with the wild type. It has been reported that the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus elicits an increased expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. We used this information and examined whether treatment with an EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib, which is already approved for clinical use in cancer therapy, can reduce the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, wild type, and Omicron and Delta variants, in two cell lines and one spheroid model. The results showed that osimertinib treatment successfully reduced infection efficacy, particularly in variants, and that this effect was not related to a reduction in cell viability, making this a promising strategy for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 include several comorbidities, but age was the most striking one since elderly people were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the reasons for this markedly unfavorable response in the elderly, immunosenescence and inflammaging appear as major drivers of this outcome. A finding that was also notable was that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 have an accumulation of senescent T cells, suggesting that immunosenescence may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present work was designed to examine whether these immunosenescence changes are characteristic of COVID-19 and whether it is dependent on disease severity using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our cross-sectional data show that COVID-19, but not other respiratory infections, rapidly increased cellular senescence and exhaustion in CD4 and CD8 T cells during early infection. In addition, longitudinal analyses with patients from Brazil and Portugal provided evidence of increased frequencies of senescent and exhausted T cells over a 7-d period in patients with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, the study suggests that accelerated immunosenescence in CD4 and especially CD8 T-cell compartments may represent a common and unique outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection.">

        <tr id="Discovered in late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has caused the largest pandemic of the 21st century, claiming more than seven million lives. In most cases, the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is relatively mild and affects only the upper respiratory tract; it most often manifests itself with fever, chills, cough, and sore throat, but also has less-common mild symptoms. In most cases, patients do not require hospitalization, and fully recover. However, in some cases, infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to the development of a severe form of COVID-19, which is characterized by the development of life-threatening complications affecting not only the lungs, but also other organs and systems. In particular, various forms of thrombotic complications are common among patients with a severe form of COVID-19. The mechanisms for the development of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 remain unclear. Accumulated data indicate that the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is based on disruptions in the functioning of various innate immune systems. The key role in the primary response to a viral infection is assigned to two systems. These are the pattern recognition receptors, primarily members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, and the complement system. Both systems are the first to engage in the fight against the virus and launch a whole range of mechanisms aimed at its rapid elimination. Normally, their joint activity leads to the destruction of the pathogen and recovery. However, disruptions in the functioning of these innate immune systems in COVID-19 can cause the development of an excessive inflammatory response that is dangerous for the body. In turn, excessive inflammation entails activation of and damage to the vascular endothelium, as well as the development of the hypercoagulable state observed in patients seriously ill with COVID-19. Activation of the endothelium and hypercoagulation lead to the development of thrombosis and, as a result, damage to organs and tissues. Immune-mediated thrombotic complications are termed “immunothrombosis”. In this review, we discuss in detail the features of immunothrombosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potential underlying mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a key homeostatic regulator of immune cells, has been implicated in multiple diseases associated with aging and chronic inflammation including Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Interestingly, subjects with idiopathic PD display reduced levels of RGS10 in subsets of peripheral immune cells. Additionally, individuals with PD have been shown to have increased activated peripheral immune cells in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) compared to age-matched healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether CSF-resident peripheral immune cells in individuals with PD also exhibit decreased levels of RGS10. Therefore, we performed an analysis of RGS10 levels in the proteomic database of the CSF from the Michael J. Fox Foundation Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study. We found that RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF of individuals with PD compared to healthy controls and prodromal individuals. Moreover, we find that RGS10 levels decrease with age but not PD progression and that males have less RGS10 than females in PD. Importantly, studies have established an association between chronic systemic inflammation (CSI) and neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, and known sources of CSI have been identified as risk factors for developing PD; however, the role of peripheral immune cell dysregulation in this process has been underexplored. As RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF and circulating peripheral immune cells of individuals with PD, we hypothesized that RGS10 regulates peripheral immune cell responses to CSI prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. To test this, we induced CSI for 6 weeks in C57BL6/J mice and RGS10 KO mice to assess circulating and CNS-associated peripheral immune cell responses. We found that RGS10 deficiency synergizes with CSI to induce a bias for inflammatory and cytotoxic cell populations, a reduction in antigen presentation in peripheral blood immune cells, as well as in and around the brain that is most notable in males. These results highlight RGS10 as an important regulator of the systemic immune response to CSI and implicate RGS10 as a potential contributor to the development of immune dysregulation in PD.">

The complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 variants and the human immune system are crucial for developing effective therapies, vaccines, and preventive measures. Understanding these immune responses highlights the intricate nature of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

It focused on untreated individuals at the time of hospital admission and examined the presence of TR3-56 cells in their immune profiles during the anti-viral immune response. Our findings provide additional insights into the complex immunological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential role of TR3-56 cells as crucial components of the immune response.

        <tr id="This editorial aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between vitamin D and viral pathogenesis. It explores the anticipated role of vitamin D as a modulator in the immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other viral pathogens. The editorial comments are based on the review article by Engin et al . The potential role of vitamin D in modulating immune responses has been highlighted by several studies, suggesting that it may influence both the risk and severity of infections. Vitamin D receptors are present in immunocompetent cells, which indicates that vitamin D can potentially modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. This context is relevant in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), where the immune response to the virus can significantly impact the disease progression and outcome. The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses. It also maintains the integrity of the body's physical barriers and modulates inflammatory responses, thereby preventing entry and replication of the virus. Many studies have suggested that adequate vitamin D levels help alleviate morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation has been linked with a lower risk of severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those with a deficiency during seasons with less sunlight exposure.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune dysregulation and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia have been implicated in fatal COVID-19 disease. However, how these two factors interact to shape disease outcomes is unclear.


METHODS
We carried out viral and immunological phenotyping on a prospective cohort of 280 patients with COVID-19 presenting to acute care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts and Genoa, Italy between June 1, 2020 and February 8, 2022. Disease severity, mortality, plasma viremia, and immune dysregulation were assessed. A mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection was used to analyze the therapeutic potential of Notch4 and pyroptosis inhibition in disease outcome.


RESULTS
Stratifying patients based on %Notch4+ Treg cells and/or the presence of plasma viremia identified four subgroups with different clinical trajectories and immune phenotypes. Patients with both high %Notch4+ Treg cells and viremia suffered the most disease severity and 90-day mortality compared to the other groups even after adjusting for baseline comorbidities. Increased Notch4 and plasma viremia impacted different arms of the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased Notch4 was associated with decreased Treg cell amphiregulin expression and suppressive function whereas plasma viremia was associated with increased monocyte cell pyroptosis. Combinatorial therapies using Notch4 blockade and pyroptosis inhibition induced stepwise protection against mortality in a mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection.


CONCLUSIONS
The clinical trajectory and survival outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is predicated on two cardinal factors in disease pathogenesis: viremia and Notch4+ Treg cells. Intervention strategies aimed at resetting the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 by antagonizing Notch4 and pyroptosis may be effective in severe cases of viral lung infection.">

        <tr id="Vascular injury and pathologies underlie common diseases including ischemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Prior work has identified a key role for glial cells, including microglia, in the multifaceted and temporally evolving neuroimmune response to both stroke and CSVD. Transcriptional profiling has led to important advances including identification of distinct gene expression signatures in ischemia-exposed, flow cytometrically sorted microglia and more recently single cell RNA sequencing-identified microglial subpopulations or clusters. There is a reassuring degree of overlap in the results from these two distinct methodologies with both identifying a proliferative and a separate type I interferon responsive microglial element. Similar patterns were later seen using multimodal and spatial transcriptomal profiling in ischemia-exposed microglia and astrocytes. Methodological advances including enrichment of specific neuroanatomic/functional regions (such as the neurovascular unit) prior to single cell RNA sequencing has led to identification of novel cellular subtypes and generation of new credible hypotheses as to cellular function based on the enhanced cell sub-type specific gene expression patterns. A ribosomal tagging strategy focusing on the cellular translatome analyses carried out in the acute phases post stroke has revealed distinct inflammation-regulating roles for microglia and astrocytes in this setting. Early spatial transcriptomics experiments using cerebral ischemia models have identified regionally distinct microglial cell clusters in ischemic core versus penumbra. There is great potential for combination of these methods for multi-omics approaches to further elucidate glial responses in the context of both acute ischemic stroke and chronic CSVD.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide ∼5 years since the first documented case. Severe COVID-19 is widely considered to be caused by a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 within the respiratory tract. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged 4-6 month old C57BL/6 mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice 4 days post infection and before death were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in the lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the emergence of viral variants with distinct characteristics. We investigated the differential effects of the original Wuhan strain and the emergent Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 using a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. We observed significant differences in disease severity, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality and more severe lung damage than the Omicron variant. Furthermore, microbiome analyses revealed distinct shifts in microbiota associated with infection by each variant, suggesting that microbiome-related mechanisms might influence disease outcomes. This comprehensive comparison enhances our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and highlights the importance of microbiome dynamics in viral infections, providing insights for future therapeutic and preventive strategies. Importance Understanding the differential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for effective public health response and treatment development. This study provides insights into the pathogenesis of the original Wuhan strain and the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, revealing significant differences in host mortality, viral load, and lung pathology. The use of the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model enables detailed examination of these differences in a controlled setting. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of the microbiome in modulating disease severity and host responses to viral infections. By uncovering distinct microbial shifts associated with infection by different SARS-CoV-2 variants, this study suggests potential microbiome-related mechanisms that might be targeted to mitigate disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="Central nervous system (CNS) resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM) that express IFN-γ contribute to neurodegenerative processes, including synapse loss, leading to memory impairments. Here, we show that CCR2 signalling in CD8 TRM that persist within the hippocampus after recovery from CNS infection with West Nile virus (WNV) significantly prevents the development of memory impairments. Using CCR2-deficient mice, we determined that CCR2 expression is not essential for CNS T cell recruitment or virologic control during acute WNV infection. However, transcriptomic analyses of forebrain CCR2+ versus CCR2- CD8 TRM during WNV recovery reveal that CCR2 signalling significantly regulates hippocampal CD8 TRM phenotype and function via extrinsic and intrinsic effects, decreasing the expression of CD103 and granzyme A and IFN-γ, respectively. Consistent with this, WNV-recovered Cd8acreCcr2fl/fl mice exhibit decreased recognition memory. Our findings highlight a neuroprotective role for CCR2 in limiting CD8 T cell-mediated neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for CNS infections.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease characterized by dysregulated self-reactive immune responses that damage the neurons’ myelin sheath, leading to progressive disability. The primary therapeutic option, immunosuppressants, inhibits pathogenic anti-myelin responses but depresses the immune system. Antigen-specific monocyte-derived autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) offer alternative therapeutic approaches to restore tolerance to autoantigens without causing generalized immunosuppression. However, immune dysregulation in MS could impact the properties of the monocytes used as starting material for this cell therapy. Here, we characterized CD14+ monocytes, mature dendritic cells, and vitamin D3–tolDCs (VitD3-tolDCs) from active, treatment-naive MS patients and healthy donors (HDs). Using multiomics, we identified a switch in these cell types toward proinflammatory features characterized by alterations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and NF-κB pathways. MS patient–derived VitD3-tolDCs showed reduced tolerogenic properties compared with those from HDs, which were fully restored through direct AhR agonism and by use of in vivo or in vitro dimethyl fumarate (DMF) supplementation. Additionally, in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model, combined therapy of DMF and VitD3-tolDCs was more efficient than monotherapies in reducing the clinical score of mice. We propose that a combined therapy with DMF and VitD3-tolDCs offers enhanced therapeutic potential in treating MS.">

        <tr id="The incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased dramatically in recent years, affecting millions of people worldwide. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients is respiratory illness. However, the disease can also significantly impact the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. ACE-2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in regulating various pathological processes. The interaction of the virus with ACE-2 in the myocardium can lead to direct heart damage. Several mechanisms may contribute to myocardial damage in COVID-19 patients, including systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon-mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response, T-cell-mediated damage, coronary plaque instability, and hypoxia. There has been concern that ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating ACE-2 expression. However, it may be advisable to continue medications for patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. The precise mechanisms of cardiomyocyte injury in COVID-19 are not fully understood, but necroptosis appears to play a significant role. Current treatments for cardiac damage in COVID-19 patients include IL-6 blockers and antiplatelet therapy. Ponatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed using computational and structural approaches, has shown the potential to affect cell death through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity. By reviewing studies related to ponatinib's effects on necroptosis and cell death, we propose a novel approach to potentially reduce the cardiotoxic effects of COVID-19 on cardiomyocytes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac injury in COVID-19 and to develop targeted therapies to protect the heart from the devastating effects of this disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT We previously demonstrated that the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients were filled with a clear hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan (HA). In this translational study, we investigated the role of HA at all stages of COVID-19 disease to map the consequences of elevated HA on morbidity and identify the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced HA production. A reduced alveolar surface area was observed in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, as visualized by a 3D rendering of lung morphology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed the presence of HA in lung biopsies and found large quantities of proinflammatory fragmented HA. The association of systemic HA in blood plasma and disease severity was assessed in patients with mild (WHO Clinical Progression Scale, WHO-CPS, 1–5) and severe COVID-19 (WHO-CPS, 6–9) during the acute and convalescent phases and related to lung function. We found that systemic levels of HA were high during acute COVID-19 disease, remained elevated during convalescence, and were associated with a reduced diffusion capacity. In vitro 3D-lung models, differentiated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells, were used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HA metabolism, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of HA synthases and hyaluronidases, both contributing to increased HA in apical secretions. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment reduced the inflammation and downregulated HA synthases. Our findings demonstrate that HA plays a role in COVID-19 morbidity and that sustained elevated HA concentrations may contribute to long-term respiratory impairment. IMPORTANCE This study provides insights into the role of hyaluronan (HA) in the severity and long-term impact of COVID-19 on lung function. Through extensive morphological examination of lung tissues and a multicenter study, we identified that HA levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with a reduced lung diffusion capacity during convalescence. Using a 3D-lung model, we further uncovered how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a dysregulated HA metabolism, leading to increased HA production. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting HA metabolism could offer new therapeutic avenues for managing COVID-19, particularly to prevent long-term lung impairment. Additionally, HA holds potential as a biomarker for predicting disease severity, which could guide personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii.

        <tr id="The upper respiratory tract (URT) virome is crucial in respiratory health and response to pathogens. While common respiratory viruses are well-studied, the presence and potential impact of giant DNA viruses, such as Mimiviridae, in the human URT remain underexplored. This study employed a whole genome metagenomics approach to profile the URT virome of 48 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients from central India. Mimiviridae reads were detected in two elderly male patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or influenza-like illness (ILI), contributing to 24% and 44% of the total virome in their samples. The dominant species were Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus and Moumouvirus. Although Mimiviridae are not traditionally associated with human respiratory infections, their presence in SARS-CoV-2 patients raises questions about their potential role in co-infections and disease severity, particularly in individuals with ongoing respiratory infections. These findings underscore the need to investigate further giant viruses' clinical significance, transmission, and pathogenicity in humans. Future research should focus on their epidemiology and the development of improved diagnostic tools to assess their contribution to human health.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus caused the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the prevalence of deaths among men is higher than among women. The epididymis, divided into caput, corpus, and cauda, shows a region-specific immunity. The K18-hACE2 mouse expresses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor that allows SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, studies using this transgenic mouse to evaluate the impact of this viral infection in epididymis have not yet been performed.


OBJECTIVES
We evaluated the expression of hACE2 in the epididymis of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice, and assessed the epididymal immune response, focusing on F4/80+ mononuclear phagocytes and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The following analyses were performed in the epididymal sections of infected mice: epithelial height and duct diameter, birefringent collagen, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labelling, immunoreactions for detection of hACE2, spike, FGF, V-ATPase, F4/80, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and iNOS. Viral particles were identified under electron microscopy. hACE2, Rigi, Tgfb1 and Tnfa expression were also evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
All epididymal regions expressed hACE2, which increased in all epididymal regions in the infected mice. However, the caput appeared to be the most infected region. Despite this, the caput region showed minimal changes while the cauda showed significant epithelial changes associated with increased iNOS immunoexpression. The F4/80+ mononuclear phagocyte area increased significantly in both stroma and epithelium. In addition to the epithelial and stromal mononuclear phagocytes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha was also detected in clear cells, whose cytoplasm showed a significant increase of this cytokine in the infected animals.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The K18-hACE2 mouse is a useful model for evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the epididymis. The infection induced hACE2 upregulation, favoring the virulence in the epididymis. The epididymal regions responded differentially to infection, and the activation of F4/80+ mononuclear phagocytes associated with the increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha immunolabeling in clear cells indicates a role of clear cells/mononuclear phagocytes immunoregulatory mechanisms in the epididymal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurological disease of the central nervous system with a subclinical phase preceding frank neuroinflammation. CD8+ T cells are abundant within MS lesions, but their potential role in disease pathology remains unclear. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the cotwin had either no or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease. Proinflammatory features of CD8+ T cells in multiple sclerosis may serve as potential therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages. Editor’s summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the nervous system in which CD8 T cells are present in MS lesions, but their role in disease progression remains unclear. Kavaka et al. analyzed CD8 T cells from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of monozygotic twins, where one twin had MS and the other showed no signs or subclinical signs of neuroinflammation (SCNI). CD8 T cells from individuals with MS and cotwins with SCNI exhibited proinflammatory immunological and metabolic features consistent with enhanced activation and migration. These findings were validated in a separate cohort of individuals with MS, providing insights into the role of CD8 T cells in MS progression. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Obesity induces diverse changes in host immunity, resulting in worse disease outcomes following infection with various pathogens, including arthritogenic alphaviruses. However, the impact of obesity on the functional landscape of immune cells during arthritogenic alphavirus infection remains unexplored. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the blood and tissue immune responses to Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection in lean and obese mice. Footpad injection of MAYV caused significant shifts in immune cell populations and induced robust expression of interferon response and proinflammatory cytokine genes and related pathways in both blood and tissue. In MAYV-infected lean mice, analysis of the local tissue response revealed a unique macrophage subset with high expression of IFN response genes that was not found in obese mice. This was associated with less severe inflammation in lean mice. These results provide evidence for a unique macrophage population that may contribute to the superior capacity of lean mice to control arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Graphical abstract Highlights Obesity worsens disease outcomes following arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Arthritogenic alphavirus infection causes significant shifts in immune cell populations in the blood and footpad. Blood monocytes from lean mice had higher expression of interferon response genes at the later stage of infection. Footpads in lean mice have an expanded population of F4/80lo macrophages with an intense interferon response gene signature before and after alphavirus infection that is not found in obese mice. Macrophages in obese mice express lower levels of interferon response genes, have a unique necroptosis signature, and higher F4/80 expression.">

        <tr id="Introduction A clear immune correlate of protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has not been defined. We explored antibody, B-cell, and T-cell responses to the third-dose vaccine and relationship to incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Adults in a prospective cohort provided blood samples at day 0, day 14, and 10 months after the third-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Participants self-reported incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma anti–SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and spike-subunit-1 and spike-subunit-2 antibodies were measured. A sub-study assessed SARS-CoV-2–specific plasma and memory B-cell and memory T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by enzyme-linked immunospot. Comparative analysis between participants who developed incident infection and uninfected participants utilised non-parametric t-tests, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard ratios. Results Of the 132 participants, 47 (36%) reported incident SARS-CoV-2 infection at a median 16.5 (16.25–21) weeks after the third-dose vaccination. RBD titres and B-cell responses, but not T-cell responses, increased after the third-dose vaccine. Whereas no significant difference in day 14 antibody titres or T-cell responses was observed between participants with and without incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, RBD memory B-cell frequencies were significantly higher in those who did not develop infection [10.0% (4.5%–16.0%) versus 4.9% (1.6%–9.3%), p = 0.01]. RBD titres and memory B-cell frequencies remained significantly higher at 10 months than day 0 levels (p < 0.01). Discussion Robust antibody and B-cell responses persisted at 10 months following the third-dose vaccination. Higher memory B-cell frequencies, rather than antibody titres or T-cell responses, predicted protection from subsequent infection, identifying memory B cells as a correlate of protection.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Although the risk of emerging coronavirus infection may seem to have disappeared at first glance, SARS-COV-2 has complex and poorly understood effects on many organ systems, including the nervous system. Disease progression and unfavorable outcome COVID-19 are not only due to lung damage, elderly age, concomitant pathology: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc. have a significant impact.Aim. To study the structure of mortality in a new coronavirus infection COVID-19, caused by delta strain of coronavirus SARS- CoV-2, taking into account the nature of concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, the degree of comorbidity, fatal complications, and sex and age characteristics.Materials and methods. A postmortem analysis of pathological and anatomical conclusions of 209 patients with COVID-19 with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology who received inpatient treatment in covid hospitals of the Republic of Mordovia in 2021 was performed. The severity of the underlying disease, concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, and comorbidity were analysed. The coincidence of the final clinical and pathological diagnoses, fatal complications were assessed. The presented data allowed to identify the main factors of unfavourable outcome.Results and discussion. In unfavourable outcome of the disease, concomitant pathology is represented by hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, chronic cerebral ischemia. In women, cases of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis were more frequent, in men - hypertension and chronic heart failure.Conclusions. New coronavirus COVID-19 infection associated with delta strain of SARS-COV-2 virus is characterised by severe and extremely severe course in elderly patients with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism and mechanisms implicated in cardiac damage in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was completely restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible. Author Summary Mosquito-borne viruses, such as those within the alphavirus genus, are an ongoing concern to human health globally. While we have recently begun to explore the mechanisms of CHIKV-induced pathology in the heart, little is known about other arboviruses and alphaviruses related to CHIKV. Here, we identified that multiple cardiac cell types are susceptible to infection by several arboviruses important to public health. Specifically, we noted differences in how two related viruses, CHIKV and MAYV, infect endothelial cells from multiple origins. This work highlights the potential for other emerging arboviruses, in addition to CHIKV, to directly infect cardiac tissue. Moreover, it emphasizes the ability for MAYV, an emerging virus that is less studied, to infect various endothelial cell types to high titers, suggesting the need for further research on MAYV pathogenesis. Finally, this research identifies differences in infection between individual strains of CHIKV, suggesting a finely tuned mechanism of restriction in endothelial cells that can be further explored, as well as the need to study use different viral strains for future alphavirus research.">

Microglia exhibit diverse transcriptional states in response to neuroinflammatory stimuli, and understanding these states is crucial for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of AD. Methods In this work, we integrated single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics data from multiple cohorts and brain regions, including microglia from experimental and human brains. Results This comprehensive atlas revealed a great heterogeneity of microglial states, with a significant enrichment of specific states, including activated microglia, in AD brains compared to controls. Further integration of spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry showed that activated microglia are predominantly located in the external cortical layers near amyloid plaques, while homeostatic microglia are more prevalent in the internal cortical layers and further away from the plaques. These spatial patterns were further validated using P2RY12 immunostaining, which confirmed the reliability of the transcriptomic data. Conclusion By integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we have provided a detailed atlas of microglial diversity, revealing the regional and pathological specificity of microglial states.">

        <tr id="The generation and maintenance of protective immunity is a dynamic interplay between host and environment that is impacted by age. Understanding fundamental changes in the healthy immune system that occur over a lifespan is critical in developing interventions for age-related susceptibility to infections and diseases. Here, we use multi-omic profiling (scRNA-seq, proteomics, flow cytometry) to examined human peripheral immunity in over 300 healthy adults, with 96 young and older adults followed over two years with yearly vaccination. The resulting resource includes scRNA-seq datasets of >16 million PBMCs, interrogating 71 immune cell subsets from our new Immune Health Atlas. This study allows unique insights into the composition and transcriptional state of immune cells at homeostasis, with vaccine perturbation, and across age. We find that T cells specifically accumulate age-related transcriptional changes more than other immune cells, independent from inflammation and chronic perturbation. Moreover, impaired memory B cell responses to vaccination are linked to a Th2-like state shift in older adults’ memory CD4 T cells, revealing possible mechanisms of immune dysregulation during healthy human aging.

        <tr id="Microglia are non-electrogenic immune cells that respond rapidly to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from infections, injuries, or other forms of damage. Microglia mitochondria are essential for providing the requisite energy resources for immune regulation. While fluctuations in energy metabolism are regulated by mitochondria and are reflected in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), there remains a lack of innovation in microglia-centric tools that capitalize on this. In this study, live imaging of microglia in acute slices from EGFP reporter mice expressing EGFP under the control of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) promoter is combined with loading a fluorescent reporter of ΔΨm. Depolarizations in the ΔΨm were recorded after administering the well-characterized immune stimulant lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia ΔΨm increased in distinctive phases with a relatively steep slope following LPS exposure. Conversely, the ΔΨm of neurons showed minimal regulation, highlighting a distinct microglia ΔΨm response to immune stimuli. Analysis of the depolarization of the microglia ΔΨm in the soma, branches, and endfeet revealed progressive changes in each subcellular domain originating in the soma and progressing outward. The inverse agonist emapunil attenuated the depolarization of the ΔΨm across states in a domain-specific manner. These findings emphasize the contribution of mitochondrial membrane dynamics in regulating microglial responses to immune stimuli. Further, this work advances a novel drug screening strategy for the therapeutic regulation of metabolic activity in inflammatory conditions of the brain.">

        <tr id="Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare and severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). While the exact disease mechanism remains unknown, previous studies suggest that mutant GFAP influences many cellular processes, including cytoskeleton stability, mechanosensing, metabolism, and proteasome function. While most studies have primarily focused on GFAP-expressing astrocytes, GFAP is also expressed by radial glia and neural progenitor cells, prompting questions about the impact of GFAP mutations on central nervous system (CNS) development. In this study, we observed impaired differentiation of astrocytes and neurons in co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons, as well as in neural organoids, both generated from AxD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with a GFAPR239C mutation. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified distinct cell populations and transcriptomic differences between the mutant GFAP cultures and a corrected isogenic control. These findings were supported by results obtained with immunocytochemistry and proteomics. In co-cultures, the GFAPR239C mutation resulted in an increased abundance of immature cells, while in unguided neural organoids and cortical organoids, we observed altered lineage commitment and reduced abundance of astrocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed increased stress susceptibility, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and altered extracellular matrix and cell-cell communication patterns in the AxD cultures, which also exhibited higher cell death after stress. Overall, our results point to altered cell differentiation in AxD patient-derived iPS-cell models, opening new avenues for AxD research.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated severity have been linked to uncontrolled inflammation and may be associated with changes in the microbiome of mucosal sites including the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. These sites play an important role in host–microbe homeostasis, and disruption of epithelial barrier integrity during COVID-19 may potentially lead to exacerbated inflammation and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in COVID-19 are highly disparate, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal, and the impact of microbial dysbiosis on disease severity is unclear. Here, we obtained plasma, rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasal swabs from 86 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 12 healthy volunteers. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial communities in the mucosal swabs and measured concentrations of circulating cytokines, markers of gut barrier integrity, and fatty acids in the plasma samples. We compared these plasma concentrations and microbiomes between healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients, some of whom had unfortunately died by the end of the study enrollment, and performed a correlation analysis between plasma variables and bacterial abundances. Rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients had reduced abundances of several commensal bacteria including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increased abundance of the opportunistic pathogens Eggerthella lenta and Hungatella hathewayi. Furthermore, the oral pathogen Scardovia wiggsiae was more abundant in the oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients who died. The abundance of both H. hathewayi and S. wiggsiae correlated with circulating inflammatory markers including IL-6, highlighting the possible role of the microbiome in COVID-19 severity and providing potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly disparate and are associated with uncontrolled inflammation; however, the individual factors that lead to this uncontrolled inflammation are not fully understood. Here, we report that severe COVID-19 is associated with systemic inflammation, microbial translocation, and microbial dysbiosis. The rectal and oropharyngeal microbiomes of COVID-19 patients were characterized by a decreased abundance of commensal bacteria and an increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens, which positively correlated with markers of inflammation and microbial translocation. These microbial perturbations may, therefore, contribute to disease severity in COVID-19 and highlight the potential for microbiome-based interventions in improving COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection can result in either productive or latent infection, the latter being the basis for the virus life-long persistence. Intriguingly, monocytes, which support latent infection, become permissive to productive infection upon differentiation to macrophages. However, the molecular factors explaining these differentiation-driven differences are not fully understood and have been so far attributed to chromatin-mediated repression of the viral genome. Here, by using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA early in monocyte and macrophage infection, we discover a major early block in viral gene expression, and viral transcripts are barely detected in infected monocytes. By unbiasedly analyzing the changes between monocytes and their differentiated counterparts, we reveal that the levels of several cell surface proteins involved in HCMV entry are upregulated upon monocyte to macrophage differentiation, and correspondingly we uncover HCMV entry into monocytes compared to macrophages is extremely inefficient. Remarkably, ectopic expression of a canonical HCMV entry receptor in monocytes facilitates productive infection of these cells, demonstrating that given efficient viral entry, monocytes, like macrophages, have the capacity to support productive infection. Among the cell surface proteins that are upregulated upon monocyte differentiation are several integrins, which we show play an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially explaining the differences in viral entry. Overall, our findings reveal that a previously unrecognized major barrier for productive infection in monocytes is entry, adding a critical layer to the paradigm of HCMV latency.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. About one-third of UC patients failed to respond to available drugs, including tofacitinib, a broad Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. However, the mechanisms underlying patient response or resistance to oral JAK inhibitors remain unknown. To elucidate the molecular and cellular pathways activated by tofacitinib in responder and non-responder patients, we generated a longitudinal single-cell RNA sequence dataset profiling both immune and non-immune cell populations from colonic biopsies of UC patients. Our analysis revealed that responders exhibited higher baseline JAK-STAT activity, while non-responders had increased baseline NF-kB pathway activation. Longitudinal comparisons showed that disease progression in non-responders was associated with increased abundance and enhanced activation of macrophages and fibroblasts. Our data suggest that resistance to tofacitinib is mediated by the hyperactivation of myeloid cells, and we identified IL-10-dependent macrophages as a cellular subset contributing to this resistance.">

        <tr id="Prion diseases are a group of rare and fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by the cellular prion protein, PrPC, misfolding into the infectious form, PrPSc, which forms aggregates in the brain. This leads to activation of glial cells, neuroinflammation, and irreversible neuronal loss, however, the role of glial cells in prion disease pathogenesis and neurotoxicity is poorly understood. Microglia can phagocytose PrPSc, leading to the release of inflammatory signaling molecules, which subsequently induce astrocyte reactivity. Animal models show highly upregulated inflammatory molecules that are a product of the Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, suggesting that this is a key regulator of inflammation in the prion-infected brain. The activation of the IκB kinase complex (IKK) by cellular stress signals is critical for NF-κB-induced transcription of a variety of genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and regulators of protein homeostasis and cell survival. However, the contribution of microglial IKK and NF-κB signaling in the prion-infected brain has not been evaluated. Here, we characterize a primary mixed glial cell model containing wild-type (WT) astrocytes and IKK knock-out (KO) microglia. We show that, when exposed to prion-infected brain homogenates, NF-κB-associated genes are significantly downregulated in mixed glial cultures containing IKK KO microglia. Mice with IKK KO microglia show rapid disease progression when intracranially infected with prions, including an increase in microglia and reactive astrocytes, and accelerated loss of hippocampal neurons and associated behavioral deficits. These animals display clinical signs of prion disease early and have a 22% shorter life expectancy compared to infected wild-type mice. Intriguingly, PrPSc accumulation was significantly lower in the brains of infected animals with IKK KO microglia compared to age-matched controls, suggesting that accelerated disease is independent of PrPSc accumulation, highlighting a glial-specific pathology. Conversely, primary mixed glia with IKK KO microglia have significantly more PrPSc accumulation when exposed to infected brain homogenates. Together, these findings present a critical role in NF-κB signaling from microglia in host protection suggesting that microglial IKK may be involved in sufficient clearance of prions.">

        <tr id="The identification of specific markers for microglia has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, markers such as P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls have been proposed as microglia-specific and widely used to explore microglial functions within various central nervous system (CNS) contexts. The specificity of these markers was based on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures even after infiltrating the CNS. However, recent findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes can adopt microglia-like characteristics while maintaining a pro-inflammatory profile upon permanent engraftment in the CNS.In this study, we utilize bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that engrafted monocytes acquire expression of established microglia markers—P2ry12, TMEM119, Fcrls—and the pan-myeloid marker Iba1, which has been commonly mischaracterized as microglia-specific. These changes are accompanied by alterations in chromatin accessibility and shifts in chromatin binding motifs that are indicative of microglial identity. Moreover, we show that engrafted monocytes dynamically regulate the expression of CX3CR1, CCR2, Ly6C, and transcription factors PU.1, CTCF, RUNX, AP-1, CEBP, and IRF2, all of which are crucial for shaping microglial identity. This study is the first to illustrate that engrafted monocytes in the retina undergo both epigenetic and transcriptional changes, enabling them to express microglia-like signatures. These findings highlight the need for future research to account for these changes when assessing the roles of monocytes and microglia in CNS pathology. Significance Statement Monocytes can express putative microglia markers P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls upon engraftment into the retina. Given their involvement in neuroinflammation, it is crucial to consider this overlap when utilizing these markers for experimental analysis.">

Materials and Methods: A comprehensive review of the current literature was conducted, analyzing studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, the expression of key viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in placental cells, and the immune responses involved in placental defense. The review also examined the clinical outcomes related to maternal and neonatal health, including adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta supports the biological plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 transplacental transmission. Histopathological findings from the infected placentas reveal inflammation, vascular changes, and the evidence of viral particles in placental tissues. Clinical reports indicate an increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and neonatal infection in pregnancies affected by COVID-19. However, the frequency and mechanisms of vertical transmission remain variable across studies, highlighting the need for standardized research protocols. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can potentially infect placental cells, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. While evidence of transplacental transmission has been documented, the risk and mechanisms are not fully understood. Ongoing research is essential to clarify these aspects and inform obstetric care practices to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in vaccination and therapies for coronavirus disease, challenges remain due to reduced antibody longevity and the emergence of virulent variants like Omicron (BA.1) and its subvariants (BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.5). This study explored the potential of adoptive immunotherapy and harnessing the protective abilities using virus-specific T cells (VSTs). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VSTs were generated by stimulating donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells with spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane protein peptide mixtures. Phenotypic characterization, including T-cell receptor (TCR) vβ and pentamer analyses, was performed on the ex vivo-expanded cells. We infected human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-partially matched human Calu-3 cells with various authentic SARS-CoV-2 strains in a Biosafety Level 3 facility and co-cultured them with VSTs. VSTs exhibited a diverse TCR vβ repertoire, confirming their ability to target a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens from both the ancestral and mutant strains, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.5. These ex vivo-expanded cells exhibited robust cytotoxicity and low alloreactivity against HLA-partially matched SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Their cytotoxic effects were consistent across variants, targeting conserved spike and nucleocapsid epitopes. Our findings suggest that third-party partial HLA-matching VSTs could counter immune-escape mechanisms posed by emerging variants of concern.">

        <tr id="In efforts to find reparative strategies for brain damage, brain-associated regulatory T cells (Tregs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Beyond their textbook immunoregulatory function, Tregs have emerged as key players in the response to brain trauma and the restoration of damaged brain tissue. Here, we are the first to describe a novel, non-canonical function of Tregs in maintaining the sealing capacity of both the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. Moreover, we identified the cytokine IL-34 as a critical determinant in this newly unveiled Treg function. Mechanistically, IL-34 exerts its influence by modulating the expression and localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in both BBB endothelial cells and choroid plexus epithelial cells, thereby reinforcing the strength of the brain barriers. Given the well-established notion of leaky brain barriers and the involvement of immunological components in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), we further demonstrate diminished IL-34 expression in Tregs derived from patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) and patients with AD and even mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Remarkably, our study reveals the potential of IL-34 treatment in reinstating the integrity of brain barriers within murine models mimicking these neurological disorders. These ground-breaking findings shed light on the intricate relationship between Tregs, IL-34, and the integrity of brain barriers. They offer novel avenues for therapeutic approaches to ameliorate brain barrier dysfunction in the context of neurological disorders.">

Given that circulatory proteins can enter the brain, we asked whether microglia are responsive to such proteins. Here, we identify a stable population of microglia specialized to take up circulatory proteins in a region-specific manner under physiological conditions; human hematopoietic stem cell-derived microglia replacing endogenous microglia in chimeric mice show similar regional specialization. Plasma-positive microglia are characterized by prominent expression of genes related to innate immunity and antigen presentation and exhibit high metabolic and phagocytic activity. This activity is dependent, in part, on microglial uptake and accumulation of circulatory Apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I). Our findings thus identify a new model of communication between brain and periphery through specialized microglia.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection often involves the nervous system, leading to cognitive dysfunctions, fatigue and many other neurological signs that are becoming increasingly recognized. Despite mild forms of the disease accounting for most cases worldwide, research on the pathophysiology driving mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has received little attention. In this respect, recent evidence has pointed out that around 30–40% of non-critical, mild-to-moderate severity COVID-19 survivors may display cognitive disturbances several months post-illness. Hence, the impact of COVID-19 on the brain structure and function, through potential neuropathological mechanisms underpinning cognitive alterations in post-mild COVID-19 infections, remains largely unexplored. This retrospective multicentre observational cohort study, entirely based on a healthcare worker sample (n = 65; 55% females, aged 21–61), investigated the cognitive status and the structural and functional brain integrity among non-hospitalized individuals who developed mild COVID-19 symptoms during the occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants Alpha to Delta, compared with healthy controls tested before the pandemic onset. All evaluations were performed at an average of 9-month follow-up post-infection period. Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and structural and functional MRI exams. Radiological inspection sought to detect the presence of white matter hyperintensities on axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Global and regional grey matter integrity assessment, analysing changes in grey matter volumes and cortical thinning, and functional connectivity alterations of resting-state brain networks were also conducted. Regression analyses tested the relationships between the presence of specific cognitive impairments and potential structural and functional brain findings. Our results revealed that clinical, cognitive screening and neuropsychological examinations were average between both groups, except for specific impairments related to executive functions in the mild COVID-19. Compared to healthy controls, mild COVID-19 subjects exhibited increased juxtacortical white matter hyperintensities, thalamic and occipital volume loss and diminished resting-state functional connectivity involving the left precuneus and cuneus in default-mode network and affecting the right angular gyrus and left precuneus in the dorsal attentional network. Reduced thalamic volume was the only variable selected in the final model explaining the observed executive function impairment in mild COVID-19. The presence of cognitive, structural and functional brain abnormalities over time suggests that the action of widespread neurovascular and inflammatory phenomena on the nervous system might also occur in mild forms following COVID-19 infection rather than permanent brain damage linked to the direct or indirect action of the virus. Our findings emphasize the need to pay attention to the long-term brain-related consequences of mild COVID-19 infections during the original stream.">

Particularly in the lung, GM-CSF plays an important homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of alveolar macrophages, and is therefore considered to play a role in respiratory virus infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, although the benefits of GM-CSF treatment in clinical studies remain inconclusive. To address this, we tested inhaled GM-CSF treatment in the Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) mouse model. Our findings show that local GM-CSF therapy during PVM disease increased local neutrophilia and monocyte-derived cell influx, but diminished CD8+ T cells responses. Despite this, the observed effects on T cells and myeloid cells did not result in an altered clinical outcome during PVM infection. We conclude that inhaled GM-CSF therapy cannot be considered as a universal protective therapy in respiratory virus infections.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence points to the microbial exposome as a critical factor in maturing and shaping the host immune system, thereby influencing responses to immune challenges such as infections or vaccines. To investigate the effect of early-life viral exposures on immune development and vaccine responses, we inoculated mice with six distinct viral pathogens in sequence beginning in the neonatal period, and then evaluated their immune signatures before and after intramuscular or intranasal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Sequential viral infection drove profound changes in all aspects of the immune system, including increasing circulating leukocytes, altering innate and adaptive immune cell lineages in tissues, and markedly influencing serum cytokine and total antibody levels. Beyond changes in the immune responses, these exposures also modulated the composition of the endogenous intestinal microbiota. Although sequentially-infected mice exhibited increased systemic immune activation and T cell responses after intramuscular and intranasal SARS-CoV-2 immunization, we observed decreased vaccine-induced antibody responses in these animals. These results suggest that early-life viral exposures are sufficient to diminish antibody responses to vaccination in mice, and highlight the potential importance of considering prior microbial exposures when investigating vaccine responses.">

Here we report that synapse engulfing microglia in the thalamus are crucial for cognitive impairment after cortical brain injury. Region-specific manipulations of reactive microglia in the chronic phase of injuries showed that microglial changes in the thalamus, but not in the hippocampus, impaired recognition memory. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the enrichment of synapse engulfing microglia in the thalamus, which developed in a CD9-dependent manner and caused synaptic loss and recognition memory deficits. In the thalamus, the blood-brain barrier was disrupted, and extravasated γ-immunoglobulins (IgG) co-localized with synapse engulfing microglia. Fcγ receptor III blockade in the thalamus reduced synapse engulfing microglia, synapse loss, and recognition memory deficits. These findings demonstrate that the induction of synapse engulfing microglia in the thalamus by extravasated IgG/FcγRIII and CD9 signals causes recognition memory deficits after cortical brain injury.">

Excessive complement activation can have deleterious outcomes for the host and is consequently tightly modulated by a set of membrane-associated and fluid-phase regulators of complement activation (RCAs). Here, we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hijacks host cellular RCA members CD55 and CD59 and serum-derived Factor H (FH) to resist antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis triggered by immunized human sera. Blockage of the biological functions of virion-associated CD55 and CD59 and competition of FH recruitment with functionally inactive recombinant FH-derived short consensus repeats SCR18-20 restore SARS-CoV-2 complement sensitivity in a synergistic manner. Moreover, complement-mediated virolysis is dependent on classical pathway activation and does not occur in the absence of virus-specific antibodies. Altogether, our findings present an intriguing immune escape mechanism that provides novel insights into the immunopathology observed in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).">

        <tr id="Long COVID, or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), was characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive impairments. These symptoms, emerging one to 2 months post-infection and persisting for several months, cannot be attributed to other diagnoses. The pathophysiology of long COVID remained elusive; however, emerging studies suggested multiple potential mechanisms, including the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus, persistent SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs, neuroinflammation, and vascular damage, which may contribute to its development. Long COVID affected multiple organ systems, including respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems, leading to a range of functional impairments. Additionally, it showed a profound impact on mental health, manifesting as anxiety and depression, which significantly degraded the quality of life. The absence of definitive treatments underscored the importance of prevention. Recent evidence indicated that early antiviral intervention—particularly with small-molecule drugs such as Metformin, Ensitrelvir, Molnupiravir, and Nirmatrelvir—may effectively reduce the incidence of long COVID. This underscored the promising role of small-molecule compounds in mitigating long-term COVID-19 consequences, offering a novel preventive strategy against long COVID and its extensive impacts on patients.">

        <tr id="The new coronavirus disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has several manifestations including neurological complications like encephalitis. The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, which are regulated by the circadian clock genes, are key signaling proteins that detect pathogenic microorganisms and sterile stressors and activate the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β and -18 (IL-1β and IL-18). The disruption of circadian rhythms following SARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the capillary endothelium could lead to hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to an enhanced inflammatory response in the central nervous system, thereby increasing susceptibility to or severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced encephalitis. This review highlights the role of the circadian-controlled NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced encephalitis and suggests targeting the NLRP3 circadian axis for timely intervention as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19-induced encephalitis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT It remains unclear how previous infections and vaccinations influenced and shaped heterogeneous immune responses against Omicron and its variants in diverse populations in China. After the national wave of Omicron in early 2023, we evaluated serum levels of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against Omicron (B.1.1.529) and its variants (BA.5, BF.7, and CH1.1) in 33 COVID-19 convalescents and 40 uninfected vaccinees, using vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudovirus neutralizing assay. In addition, we followed 34 Delta convalescent patients to compare their immune responses against Omicron before (late 2021) and after the Omicron wave (early 2023). NAbs at the acute phase of the disease were investigated in 50 Omicron inpatients, including 24 vaccinated and 26 unvaccinated patients. Among them, nasal mucosal IgA levels were measured in 42 subjects. Compared to vaccination, breakthrough infections significantly increased the breadth and magnitude of serum nAbs and mucosal IgA levels against Omicron variants. Exposure to Omicron but not Delta elicited stronger pan-Omicron responses. In Omicron inpatients, nAbs continued to rise as vaccination doses increased. However, in both vaccinees and convalescents, a fourth dose vaccination did not elicit higher nAbs against Omicron. Furthermore, nAbs against Omicron variants lasted longer than nAbs against WT SARS-CoV-2. Breakthrough infections of Omicron variants elicited specific immune responses against Omicron compared to vaccination and Delta infection. Although repeated vaccination revealed limited impacts on serum nAbs, populations at high risk of hospitalization may still benefit from continued vaccination. IMPORTANCE The study described the specific humoral immunity against Omicron and its variants (BA.5, BF.7, and CH1.1) in diverse populations, including Delta-positive convalescent patients, Omicron-infected patients with a previous or current confirmed Delta infection, Omicron-positive patients, and healthy controls. In addition, we followed Delta convalescents for 1 year to evaluate the effect of a booster vaccine, breakthrough infection, and reinfection. Nasal mucosal IgA levels against SARS-CoV-2 were also examined. The findings of this study demonstrated the varied responses of individuals in different states following the outbreak of Omicron, highlighting the potential advantages of ongoing immunization for groups that are more vulnerable and have a greater likelihood of being hospitalized.">

        <tr id="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm birth. Supplemental oxygen administration, while lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to develop BPD. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that the innate immune response activated in the lungs of mice sensitive to hyperoxia that develop BPD-like lung injury differs from mice resilient to disease. Specifically, we identified a selective upregulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on lung macrophages and monocytes in the hyperoxia-sensitive C57BL/6J mouse strain. We show that loss of function of TREM2 signaling in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatically improved phenotype after neonatal hyperoxia exposure characterized by a dampened immune response, preserved alveolar structure, and preserved cell proliferative potential supporting normal lung development. At the molecular level, inhibition of TREM2 signaling dampened the magnitude of p53 activation and resulted in cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. These findings show that TREM2 is a critical regulator of the pathogenic innate immune response to hyperoxia and highlight its importance as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating injury in the hyperoxia-exposed developing lung.">

Acute infectious diseases are some of the most common reasons for receiving medical care, and analysis of the host immune response is an attractive approach for their diagnosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential usefulness of CD169 expression on peripheral monocytes (mCD169) as a marker of viral-associated host immune response.


METHODS
In a large mono-institutional cohort of 4,025 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) and other viral infections, mCD169 analysis was performed by rapid flow cytometry assay.


RESULTS
Increased mCD169 values (median, 17.50; IQR, 8.40-25.72) were found in 1,631 patients with CoV2+ acute infection compared to 2,394 in CoV2- patients (median, 2.35; IQR, 2.0-3.25) (odds ratio [OR], 21.84; 95% CI ,17.53-27.21; P < .001). Among CoV2- patients, 1,484 (62.0%) were assessed for other viral infections, and viral etiology was laboratory confirmed in 428 patients (CoV2- Vir+), with RNA viruses most frequently detected (94.6%). Higher levels of mCD169 were also confirmed in CoV2- Vir+ compared to CoV2- Vir- patients (OR, 10.05; 95% CI, 7.35-13.74; P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
mCD169 analysis by rapid flow cytometry assay may be a sensitive broad marker useful for the rapid triage of patients with suspected acute viral infections and could potentially be directly applied to eventual new emergent viral outbreaks.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="Despite the emerging consensus that microglia are critical to physiological and pathological brain function, it is unclear how microglial roles and their underlying mechanisms differ between brain regions. Microglia throughout the brain express common markers, such as the purinergic receptor P2Y12, that delineate them from peripheral macrophages. P2Y12 is a critical sensor of injury but also contributes to the sensing of neuronal activity and remodeling of synapses, with microglial loss of P2Y12 resulting in behavioral deficits. P2Y12 has largely been studied in cortical microglia, despite the fact that a growing body of evidence suggests that microglia exhibit a high degree of regional specialization. Cerebellar microglia, in particular, exhibit transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional profiles that set them apart from their better studied cortical and hippocampal counterparts. Here, we demonstrate that P2Y12 deficiency does not alter the morphology, distribution, or dynamics of microglia in the cerebellum. In fact, loss of P2Y12 does little to disturb the distinct transcriptomic profiles of cortical and cerebellar microglia. However, unlike in cortex, P2Y12 is not required for a full microglial response to focal injury, suggesting that cerebellar and cortical microglia use different cues to respond to injury. Finally, we show that P2Y12 deficiency impairs cerebellar learning in a delay eyeblink conditioning task, a common test of cerebellar plasticity and circuit function. Our findings suggest not only region-specific roles of microglial P2Y12 signaling in the focal injury response, but also indicate a conserved role for P2Y12 in microglial modulation of plasticity across regions.">

        <tr id="Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often causes coagulation disorders that affect highly vascularized organs, such as the lungs and kidneys.

Objective
The objective of this study was to report the histopathological findings of variations in the fibrin pattern of pulmonary and renal microthrombi in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Minimally invasive autopsies were performed on 40 patients to collect lung (n=40) and kidney (n=16) tissue samples. Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques were used for histopathological analyses. Premortem laboratory data were obtained from the patients' electronic medical records.

Results
The lung tissue showed a patchy pattern, characterized by areas of both minimal and severe damage. The most significant histopathological finding was the detection of thrombi with fibrin structures organized into discrete star-shaped units, which were more frequently observed in areas with severe lung injury than in those with minimal lung injury (p = 0.012). Star-shaped fibrin structures were also observed in the renal glomerular capillaries. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of platelets and the procoagulant proteins von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Factor VIII within the star-shaped fibrin thrombi. Patients with star-shaped fibrin thrombi had higher levels of the systemic inflammatory indicators C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

Conclusion
Our observations suggest that the inflammatory microenvironment resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the formation of star-shaped fibrin units in the pulmonary and renal microthrombi.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and immune dysregulation are key features of the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes of brain ischemia. A comprehensive understanding of the interconnected mechanisms and endogenous mediators that regulate these processes is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, the present study investigates the role of cortistatin, a neuropeptide broadly distributed within the central nervous and immune systems. Given its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties, cortistatin positions as a promising endogenous factor in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. To evaluate its potential effects, we employed the widely recognized preclinical model of stroke, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), in young (3 months) and middle-aged (6 months) cortistatin-deficient mice and compared them with wild-type mice, assessing both short-term (48 hours) and long-term (7 days) outcomes. Our findings indicate that cortistatin deficiency in both young and middle-aged mice results in increased susceptibility to stroke and a significantly worsened prognosis, characterized by severe neurological deficits, altered microglial activity, impaired astrocytic scar formation, BBB disruption, dysregulated angiogenesis, and exacerbated immune infiltration and peripheral immune responses. Notably, the administration of cortistatin reversed these adverse outcomes, underscoring the critical role of cortistatin in regulating the complex interactions between the nervous and immune systems. Furthermore, cortistatin treatment for one week markedly improved key processes involved in stroke recovery, including neuronal repopulation, myelin repair, and the restoration of BBB integrity. The multifaceted therapeutic effects of cortistatin across various pathological stages and phenotypes suggest that multimodal therapies could represent a novel and more effective approach for treating ischemic stroke, offering advantages over current interventions that typically target only a single aspect of stroke pathology. In conclusion, our findings emphasize the significance of identifying the endogenous and therapeutic roles of neuro-immune mediators such as cortistatin in ischemic stroke.">

The immune system is a pivotal function in establishing the course of SARS-COV-2 infection. Severe instances of COVID-19 and the resulting death are caused less by the virus itself than by the destructive unrestrained immune response. Among the host determinants for poor disease prognosis is probably genetic vulnerability to dysregulated immune response. The objective of this work is to examine some of the host genetic variables that are being studied in relation to the severity of COVID-19. The complex relationship between autoimmunity and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 was examined.

All patients had been diagnosed with the virus using real-time polymerase chain reaction. A total of 70 blood samples (35 from the mild group, 35 from the severe group, and 35 from the controlled group) were obtained in EDTA tubes. Orderly to investigate the correlation between the progression of disease and variations in specific regions of host immunoassays had been used by flow cytometry. The results of the flow cytometry were reported as the average percentage of positive cells for CD4 and CD8 immunological markers. Cases with COVID-19 had a substantially lower mean CD4 concentration than the healthy patients. Furthermore, the mean concentration of CD8 was significantly lower in cases with COVID-19 than in healthy. In addition, there is significant (P 0.001) decline in both CD4 and CD8 mean levels between patients with severe and mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Astroviruses are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and have been recognized to cause fatal cases of encephalitis. A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model, as previous attempts failed to identify a suitable host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans that is a causative agent of encephalitis. VA1 RNA levels peak in heart tissue at day 7 post-inoculation. The cardiotropism was observed in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds evidenced by high VA1 RNA loads in heart tissue of A/J, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, Balb/c, and J:ARC mice. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Intracellular viral capsid was present in tissue sections based on immunofluorescent staining and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA co-localizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by > 10-fold in heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we also tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in human cardiac microvascular and coronary artery endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of viral pathogenesis and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses. Author Summary Astroviruses typically cause viral diarrhea in humans but can also cause serious infections of the brain. Previously, the methods available to study how these viruses lead to invasive infections were limited. Here, we describe the first system to study human-infecting astroviruses using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infected heart tissue and was associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of virus in their hearts and blood. Linking back to human health, we also found that VA1 can infect cells derived from human blood vessels of the heart. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans. In the future, we can develop interventions that will prevent and treat astrovirus infections in humans.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives In multiple sclerosis (MS), immune cells invade the CNS and destroy myelin. Macrophages contribute to demyelination and myelin repair, and their role in each process depends on their ability to acquire specific phenotypes in response to external signals. In this article, we assess whether defects in MS patient macrophage responses may lead to increased inflammation or lack of neuroregenerative effects. Methods CD14+CD16− monocytes from patients with MS and healthy controls (HCs) were activated in vitro to obtain homeostatic-like, proinflammatory, and proregenerative macrophages. Macrophage activation profiles were assessed through RNA sequencing and metabolomics. Surface molecule expression of CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR and myelin phagocytic capacity were evaluated with flow cytometry. Macrophage supernatant capacity to influence oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation toward an astrocytic or oligodendroglia fate was also tested. Results We observed that MS patient monocytes ex vivo recapitulate their preferential activation toward the CD16+ phenotype, a subset of proinflammatory cells overrepresented in MS lesions. Functionally, MS patient macrophages display a decreased capacity to phagocytose human myelin and a deficit of processing myelin after ingestion. In addition, MS patient macrophage supernatant favors astrocytes over oligodendrocyte differentiation when compared with HC macrophage supernatant. Furthermore, even when exposed to homeostatic or proregenerative stimuli, MS patient macrophages uphold a proinflammatory transcriptomic profile with higher levels of cytokine/chemokine. Of interest, MS patient macrophages exhibit a distinct metabolic signature with a mitochondrial energy metabolism blockage. Transcriptomic data are further substantiated by metabolomics studies that reveal perturbations in the corresponding metabolic pathways. Discussion Our results show an intrinsic defect of MS patient macrophages, reminiscent of innate immune cell memory in MS, lifting macrophage importance in the disease and as potential therapeutic targets.">

 Long-COVID (also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, PASC), is defined as the persistence, or the new onset, of symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19.
 It consists of a multiorgan syndrome expressing itself with a wide variety of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular symptoms such us chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and sleep disorders even in the absence of a clear evidence of organ dysfunction.
 Some previous studies have suggested the potential role of an abnormal inflammatory response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, however the specific underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
 In this study we performed a proteomic analysis of the serum of 80 long-COVID patients to identify potential biomarkers that may act as indicators or therapeutic targets for long COVID.



 We compared the levels of the proteins in both long-COVID group and a control group using multivariate and univariate analysis. Both PLS-DA and PCA analysis showed a clear distinction between the two groups; clustering analysis also clearly separated control from long-COVID patients. Proteins were then filtered based on (a) statistical analysis, considering proteins with a VIP>1 (PLSDA) and p<0.05 (t-test); (b) coefficient of variation (CV), where only proteins with CV<10 were considered; (c) and fold change (FC), for which proteins with FC<0.67 or FC>1.5 were selected for further analysis.
 The selected proteins were then subjected to a ROC curve analysis to identify antithrombin as a potential biomarker with an area under the curve (AUC) near 1. Other proteins, displaying an AUC > 0.98, were also identified as potential biomarkers (Sirtuin 1, NatriureticPeptide B, Hemopexin Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase). In addition, a multivariate ROC method, using linear SVM as classification method, identified that a combination of ten proteins would also result in an AUC near 1.
 Finally, a correlation analysis between the proteins of interest and the clinical manifestations was performed. A positive correlation (above 0.5) was found between dyspnea and Glucocorticoid Receptor and between memory deficit and Antithrombin. Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase was negatively correlated (below -0.5) with tremors and hair loss, MannoseBinding Lectin 2 was found to be positively linked to asthenia, Antithrombin with concentration deficit and Endothelin-2 with muscles aches.



 The identified biomarkers are associated with inflammatory processes, corroborating literature evidence that long-COVID patients develop an inflammatory state that damages many tissues. Further studies are needed to validate this data in larger cohorts to identify specific biomarkers, and guide future preventive strategies or treatments to address long COVID and its cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular sequelae.

        <tr id="Acute COVID-19 is a viral infection caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in dramatically decreased peripheral blood CD3+T cell count apparently due to alterations of thymic T cell maturation, that can persist long term afterwards. Therefore, we analyzed the levels of peripheral blood TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), and investigated the main alterations in peripheral blood T cell subsets in COVID-19 convalescents. We performed molecular quantification of TRECs with “TREC/KREC-AMP PS” kit and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes from three groups of patients. The first group contained 109 samples from COVID-19 convalescents (6–12 month post-acute COVID-19) with normal levels of TRECs (TRECn); the second was formed from COVID-19 convalescents (6–12 month post-acute COVID-19) with decreased levels of TRECs (TREClow, n = 29), and healthy control group (HC, n = 18). We noticed no significant differences between all three groups in CD3+T cell relative and absolute numbers. However, CD4+T cell frequencies were decreased in TREClow and TRECn groups compared to HC (40.8% (31.6; 50.1) and 46.4% (40.0; 53.0) vs 53.5% (47.36; 56.9), p 0.001 and р = 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, Th cell levels were decreased in TREClow patients vs HC and TRECn groups (701 cell/1 µL (478; 807) vs 1005 cell/1 µL (700; 1419), р = 0.020, and 876 cell/ 1 µL (661; 1046), р = 0.008, respectively). Finally, both groups of COVID-19 convalescents had increased frequencies of circulating CD8+T cells — 29.4% (20.7; 39.7) in TREClow group, 26.5% (21.1; 32.7) in TRECn group vs 21.3% (17.1; 26.0) in healthy controls (p = 0.024 and р = 0.026, respectively). In TRECn group, CD8+T cell count was elevated vs control range (508 cell/1 µL (372; 622) vs 356 cell/1 µL (247; 531), р = 0.044). Thus, COVID-19 convalescents (6–12 month post-acute COVID-19) showed an imbalance in CD4+and CD8+T cell level even at 6–12 months post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the observed changes in peripheral blood T cells could be closely related to the alterations in thymic T cell maturation and differentiation. Such a long-term decline in TREC levels in the circulation may have a profound impact on immune system functions and requires immunocorrection therapy.">

        <tr id="Significance Long COVID occurs in small but important minority of patients following COVID-19, reducing quality of life and contributing to healthcare burden. Although research into underlying mechanisms is evolving, immunity is understudied. As the recall of T cell memory promotes more rapid recovery and ameliorates disease outcomes, establishment of robust memory T cells is important for protection against subsequent infections, even when the virus mutates. We defined how SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and B cell responses are established and maintained following infection and vaccination for 2 y in people with long COVID. We found robust and prototypical SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with effector phenotype and key T cell receptor signatures in people with long COVID following SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent COVID-19 vaccination.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome in COVID-19, leads to complex immune reactions, hyperactivation of immunocompetent cells, including increased degranulation activity of mast cells and the release of their secretome products. The SARS-CoV-2 virus and the subsequent strong immune and inflammatory response, as well as a violation of the regulation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways, cause massive activation of latent TGF-β in the lungs, as well as the latent pool of TGF-β in the blood of patients with COVID-19. 
AIMS: To assume the participation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in lung damage in patients with COVID-19 by determining its quantitative level in autopsy lung samples in patients with COVID-19 and to conduct a correlation analysis with clinical and laboratory parameters. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included samples of lung autopsy material obtained from patients who died from severe COVID-19. A correlation analysis of TGF-β-positive cells and clinical and laboratory parameters was also performed. 
RESULTS: Extensive representation of TGF-β-positive cells was found in lung tissues of patients who died from COVID-19.A negative correlation was revealed: between TGF-β and the content of nucleated neutrophils in the blood (r = - 0,617; p = 0,033); between TGF-β and the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) according to the results of blood biochemistry (r = - 0,491; p = 0,013). A positive correlation was revealed between TGF-β and the content of blood platelets (r = 0,384; p =0,012);TGF-β with the level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = 0,409; p = 0,025). A positive correlation was also found between TGF-β and the presence of cough in the patient at the beginning of hospitalization (r = 0,367; p = 0,046). 
CONCLUSIONS: Activation of TGF-β in the lungs of patients who died from severe COVID-19 correlates with the level of neutrophils, platelets, ESR, CRP and the presence of cough in the patient. Further research is needed on the activation, release of TGF-β and its interactions in larger cohorts of patients. These correlations suggest the negative involvement of the transforming growth factor and consider the therapeutic possibilities of regulatory influence on its activation.">

        <tr id="Background: The difference in the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with mild versus severe disease remains poorly understood. Recent scientific advances have recognised the vital role of both B cells and T cells; however, many questions remain unanswered, particularly for T cell responses. T cells are essential for helping the generation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses but have also been recognised in their own right as a major factor influencing COVID-19 disease outcomes. The examination of T cell receptor (TCR) family differences over a 12-month period in patients with varying COVID-19 disease severity is crucial for understanding T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied a machine learning approach to analyse TCR vb family responses in COVID-19 patients (n = 151) across multiple timepoints and disease severities alongside SARS-CoV-2 infection-naïve (healthy control) individ-uals (n = 62). Results: Blood samples from hospital in-patients with moderate, severe, or critical disease could be classified with an accuracy of 94%. Furthermore, we identified significant variances in TCR vb family specificities between disease and control subgroups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest advantageous and disadvantageous TCR repertoire patterns in relation to disease severity. Following validation in larger cohorts, our methodology may be useful in detecting protective immunity and the assessment of long-term outcomes, particularly as we begin to unravel the immunological mechanisms leading to post-COVID complications.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are the leading cause of disease exacerbations in individuals with chronic pulmonary diseases, primarily due to impaired macrophage functions, resulting in defective bacterial elimination. We previously demonstrated that HRV16 impairs macrophages’ functions in an ARL5b-dependent manner. In permissive cells, ARL5b acted as an HRV16 restriction factor and was repressed. Here, we delve into the dual regulation of ARL5b by HRV16 in both cell types. We analyzed the effect of HRV16 on primary human macrophages using neutralizing antibodies, specific inhibitors, siRNA, and chromatin immune precipitation. Our study reveals that, while the virus does not replicate in macrophages, it induces interferon and pro-inflammatory responses. We identify the ICAM-1-PKR-ATF2 signaling axis as crucial for ARL5b induction in macrophages, whereas only ICAM-1 plays a role in ARL5b repression in permissive cells. Furthermore, HRV16 triggers epigenetic reprogramming in both cell types at the ARL5b promoter. In macrophages, epigenetic changes are ATF2 dependent. In conclusion, our findings highlight previously unknown signaling pathways activated by HRV16 in macrophages. Targeting these pathways could offer novel strategies to improve outcomes for individuals with respiratory conditions. IMPORTANCE Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are the leading cause of disease exacerbations in individuals with chronic pulmonary conditions and are frequently associated with bacterial superinfections due to defective bacterial elimination by macrophages. We previously identified ARL5b-induction by HRV16 to be responsible for the impairment of bacteria elimination. In contrast, in permissive cells, ARL5b is repressed and acts as a restriction factor for HRV16. Here, we investigated the dual regulation of ARL5b by HRV16 in these cells. Our study reveals that the ICAM-1-PKR-ATF2 signaling axis is crucial for ARL5b induction in macrophages. In permissive cells, only ICAM-1 plays a role in ARL5b repression. Moreover, HRV16 triggered epigenetic reprogramming in macrophages. ARL5b promoter was repressed in an ATF2-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings reveal previously unknown signaling pathways activated by HRV16 in macrophages. Targeting these pathways provides novel strategies to target ARL5b expression specifically in macrophages and improve outcomes for individuals with respiratory pathologies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to myocardial and endothelial damage. The present study sought to characterize the cardiovascular sequel in a large group of consecutive patients admitted for out-patient cardiovascular follow-up after a symptomatic COVID-19 infection.


METHODS
The aims of this study were as follows: to evaluate the presence of post-covid cardiovascular symptoms in an unselected population of outpatients referred to a post-COVID outpatient cardiology clinic and to characterize the long-term abnormalities associated with a more severe COVID-19 infection clinical course. A total of 914 patients were included in this single-center, observational, cross-sectional study, of which 163 were hospitalized and 149 required mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were analyzed at follow-up according to the care setting during the initial presentation.


RESULTS
The median time to follow-up was 126 days. At that time, only 3.5% of patients reported no persistent dyspnea, chest pain, or fatigue on exertion. In a follow-up echocardiographic assessment, patients who required hospitalization showed slight alterations in the pulmonary acceleration time and the tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient, as well as reduced exercise tolerance during treadmill exercise testing when compared to patients with a benign clinical course. 24-hour Holter EKG monitoring or 24-hour blood pressure monitoring did not identify significant differences between the analyzed subgroups.


CONCLUSIONS
The current study reports on an association between COVID-19 severity and the presence of cardiovascular alterations at follow-up. A simple diagnostic protocol, comprising an exercise treadmill test and transthoracic echocardiography is useful in identifying patients who may benefit from regular, structured cardiovascular medical care.">

        <tr id="Viral infections can induce changes in innate immunity that persist after virus clearance. Here, we used blood samples from a human influenza H3N2 challenge study to perform comprehensive multi-omic analyses. We detected remodeling of immune programs in innate immune cells after resolution of the infection that was proportional in magnitude to the level of prior viral load. We found changes associated with suppressed inflammation including decreased cytokine and AP-1 gene expression as well as decreased accessibility at AP-1 targets and interleukin-related gene promoter regions. We also found decreased histone deacetylase gene expression, increased MAP kinase gene expression, and increased accessibility at interferon-related gene promoter regions. Genes involved in inflammation and epigenetic-remodeling showed modulation of gene-chromatin site regulatory circuit activity. These results reveal a coordinated rewiring of the epigenetic landscape in innate immune cells induced by mild influenza virus infection.">

However, the role of microglia in GB pathogenesis remains unclear, especially regarding the in vivo dynamics of their interplay. Performing three-photon imaging in an autochthonous, immunocompetent mouse GB model, we examined tumor/microglia dynamics within previously inaccessible regions at the GB far infiltration zone in the corpus callosum. Initially, microglia increased tissue surveillance upon encountering GB-cells in sparsely infiltrated areas. In contrast, when GB-cell density increased, microglia reduced surveillance, suggesting a biphasic response to tumor invasion. Additionally, microglia were not uniformly attracted to infiltrating GB-cells; only a subset moved directionally toward them within a defined spatial range. This study provides insight into the heterogeneity of the immune response to tumor invasion and the dynamics of microglia-GB interactions in vivo. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Microglia are brain’s resident immune cells known for their dynamic responses to tissue and vascular injury. Little is known about how microglial activity differs across the life-stages of early development, adulthood, and aging. Using two-photon live imaging, we show that microglia in the adult cerebral cortex exhibit highly ramified processes and relatively immobile somata under basal conditions. Their responses to injury occur over minutes and are highly coordinated neighboring microglia. In neonates, microglia are denser and more mobile but less morphologically complex. Their responses to focal laser-induced injuries of capillaries or parenchymal tissue are uncoordinated, delayed and persistent over days. In the aged brain, microglia somata remain immobile under basal conditions but their processes become less ramified. Their responses to focal injuries remain coordinated but are slower and less sensitive. These studies confirm that microglia undergo significant changes in their morphology, distribution, dynamics and response to injury across the lifespan. HIGHLIGHTS Microglia undergo significant morphological and dynamic changes between life-stages. Neonatal microglia are highly dynamic, less morphologically complex and mount delayed responses to focal injury compared to adult microglia. Aged microglia are slightly less ramified and their responses to focal injury are slow and less sensitive than adult microglial. Maturation of microglial morphology in the developing cortex is disrupted by focal laser injury.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and is widespread over the world. This disease shows a 5.1% mortality. The understanding of the disease has expanded rapidly in many areas, including virological, epidemiological, clinical, and management dimensions. To better understand the inflammatory and immune profiles that impact the pathogenesis and development of severe COVID-19 symptoms, further studies are essential. This research aims to explore the inflammatory and adaptive immune responses associated with COVID-19, considering factors such as genetic diversity and environmental exposure among Saudi patients. The goal is to determine if patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit different disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: This case-control study includes 115 participants (healthy and with COVID-19 infection), 55 of which had confirmed cases of COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICUs) at different hospitals in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia. Whole blood samples were collected from June to September 2021 for cellular analyses, and inflammation marker data were collected from hospital records. The expression of activation markers on B (CD27 and CD38) and T cells (CD27 and HLA-DR) was obtained using the flow cytometry technique. Also, serum was collected for cytokine measurements, including IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF- α. Results: The results indicated that lymphopenia and excessive T cell activation were more prevalent in severe cases than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the results revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had an increased frequency of CD19+ B cells, with changes in B cell subsets. The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers with pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers in severe COVID-19 cases, which could be targeted for therapeutic interventions. This might be a valuable approach for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Microglial cells are the phagocytic cells of the brain that under physiological conditions participate in brain homeostasis and surveillance. Under pathogenic states, microglia undergoes strong morphological and transcriptional changes potentially leading to sustained neuroinflammation, brain damage, and cognitive disorders. Postnatal and adult Zika virus (ZIKV) brain infection is characterized by the induction of reactive microglia associated with brain inflammation, synapse loss and neuropathogenesis. Contrary to neurons, microglial cells are not infected by ZIKV thus raising the question of the mechanism governing ZIKV-induced microglia's reactivity. In this work, we have questioned the role of exogenous, neuronal type I interferons (IFNs-I) in regulating ZIKV-induced microglia's reactivity. Primary cultured microglial cells were either treated with conditioned media from ZIKV-infected mature neurons or co-cultured with ZIKV-infected neurons. Using either an antibody directed against the IFNAR receptor that neutralizes the IFNs-I response or Ifnar-/-microglial cells, we demonstrate that IFNs-I produced by ZIKV-infected neurons are the main regulators of the phagocytic capacity and the pro-inflammatory gene expression profile of reactive, non-infected microglial cells. We identify protein kinase R (PKR), whose expression is activated by IFNs-I, as a major regulator of the phagocytic capacity, pro-inflammatory response, and morphological changes of microglia induced by IFNs-I while up-regulating STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression. Results obtained herein in vitro with primary cultured cells and in vivo in ZIKV-infected adult immunocompetent mice, unravel a role for IFNs-I and PKR in directly regulating microglia's reactivity that could be at work in other infectious and non-infectious brain pathologies.">

        <tr id="Microglia signatures refer to distinct gene expression profiles or patterns of gene activity that are characteristic of microglia. Advances in gene expression profiling techniques, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, have allowed us to study microglia at a more detailed level and identify unique gene expression patterns that are associated, but not always, with different functional states of these cells. Microglial signatures depend on the developmental stage, brain region, and specific pathological conditions. By studying these signatures, it has been possible to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of microglial activation and begin to develop targeted therapies to modulate microglia-mediated immune responses in the CNS. Historically, the first two signatures coincide with M1 pro-inflammatory and M2 anti-inflammatory phenotypes. The first one includes upregulation of genes such as CD86, TNF-α, IL-1β, and iNOS, while the second one may involve genes like CD206, Arg1, Chil3, and TGF-β. However, it has long been known that many and more specific phenotypes exist between M1 and M2, likely with corresponding signatures. Here, we discuss specific microglial signatures and their association, if any, with neurodegenerative pathologies and other brain disorders.">

To define the molecular features underlying CZS in a relevant human cell model, we evaluated ZIKV infection and neurodevelopment in primary fetal brain explants and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mixed neural cultures at single cell resolution. We identified astrocytes as key innate immune sentinel cells detecting ZIKV and producing IFN-β. In contrast, neural progenitor cells displayed impaired innate immunity and supported high levels of viral replication. ZIKV infection of neurons suppressed differentiation and synaptic signaling networks and programmed a molecular switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis. We identified a universal ZIKV-driven cellular stress response linked to intrinsic apoptosis and regulated by IFN-β. These findings reveal how innate immune signaling intersects with ZIKV-driven perturbations in cellular function to influence CZS outcomes including neuron developmental dysfunction and apoptotic cell death.">

To directly compare and further analyze the autoantibody profiles of sepsis patients with and without COVID-19, the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) assay was used to measure the levels of autoantibodies against a variety of clinically relevant cytokines, lung-associated proteins, other autoantigens, and antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, cytokine titers were measured with the LEGENDplex™ Human Antivirus Response Panel. We observed significantly increased levels of autoantibodies in 59% of the COVID-19-Sepsis group compared to 48% of the Sepsis group. Significant differences were identified between the groups for the levels of autoantibodies against gATPase. The cytokine levels of interferon (IFN)-λ1 and IP-10 were higher in the COVID-19-Sepsis group compared to the Sepsis group. Additional correlations between autoantibodies, cytokines and 30-day survival could be demonstrated, suggesting varied underlying pathological mechanisms. Elevated levels of cytokines and autoantibodies may serve as prognostic indicators for the survival probability of sepsis patients, highlighting the intricate relationship between immune responses and patient outcomes in the context of both sepsis and COVID-19.">

However, whether the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) influences microglial migration remains unknown. Label-free proteomic profiling predicted changes in RHO-signaling activity that hint at dysregulated cytoskeleton signaling in Cx3cr1-deficient murine cortex tissue. To further investigate microglial migration, we carried out 4-hour interval two-photon in vivo imaging for 72 hours after a laser lesion in the cortex. Cx3cr1-deficient microglia showed enhanced migration towards the lesion. Additionally, length and velocity of microglial fine processes extending towards the lesion were increased in Cx3cr1-deficient microglia. Migration remained unchanged in Ccr2-deficient mice, indicating that monocyte-derived macrophages/microglia did not contribute to microglia accumulation around the lesion. These results demonstrate microglia migration towards CNS injury and suggest CX3CR1 as a modulator of this. Manipulating microglia migration via CX3CR1 therefore is a potential target for treatment of CNS-injury.">

This narrative review delves into host miRNAs’ multifaceted roles within the COVID-19 context, highlighting their involvement in disease progression, diagnostics, and prognostics aspects, given their stability in biological fluids and varied expression profiles when responding to an infection. Additionally, we discuss complicated interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and host cellular machinery facilitated by host miRNAs revealing how dysregulation of host miRNA expression profiles advances viral replication, immune evasion, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, it investigates the potential of host miRNAs as therapeutic agents, whether synthetic or naturally occurring, which could be harnessed to either mitigate harmful inflammation or enhance antiviral responses.

        <tr id="Microglia, the residential immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibited in multiple states from resting to activated, play a significant role in neurogenesis, myelination, synaptic transmission, immune surveillance, and neuroinflammation. The aggravated inflammatory response by microglia triggers the generation of superoxide, which often causes the degeneration of neurons, leading to the development of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. The oxidative stress is key to many neurological disorders, often regulated by many genes. The terminal neutralization of oxidative stress is mediated by NADPH and glutathione. The cytosolic NADPH level is majorly contributed by a key enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The deficiency of G6PD is associated with hemolytic anemia, diabetes, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurological disorders. Our recent study indicated that G6PD deficiency decreases cytosolic NADPH levels and alters redox homeostasis and lysosomal function in microglia. Therefore, replenishment of NADPH is crucial for targeting G6PD deficiency-mediated microglial dysfunctions. This research promotes alternate metabolic pathways by targeting the expression and activity of enzymes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and malic enzyme 1 (ME1), which are responsible for cytoplasmic NADPH production. Metabolites like citric and malic acid supplementation promote NADPH production and reduce microglial oxidative stress. Additionally, using another group of small-molecule metabolites, such as dieckol and resveratrol, enhances the expression of IDH1 and ME1 enzymes to resolve potential tissue heterogeneity. Finally, combining these metabolites supplementation increased NADPH production and restored redox homeostasis and lysosomal function in G6PD deficient microglia, indicating their further use as potential therapeutics against G6PD deficiency disorders.

        <tr id="The innate and adaptive immune systems collaborate to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, minimize the viral spread, and kill infected cells, ultimately leading to the resolution of the infection. The adaptive immune system develops a memory of previous encounters with the virus, providing enhanced responses when rechallenged by the same pathogen. Such immunological memory is the basis of vaccine function. Here, we review the current knowledge on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, focusing on the pivotal role of T cells in establishing protective immunity against the virus. After providing an overview of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we describe the main features of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including cross-reactive T cells, generated in patients with different degrees of COVID-19 severity, and of Spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced by vaccines. Finally, we discuss T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants and hybrid immunity and conclude by highlighting possible strategies to improve the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination.">

        <tr id="The role of nonneuronal cells in the resolution of cerebral ischemia remains to be fully understood. To decode key molecular and cellular processes that occur after ischemia, we performed spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the male mouse brain during the first week of injury. Cortical gene expression was severely disrupted, defined by inflammation and cell death in the lesion core, and glial scar formation orchestrated by multiple cell types on the periphery. The glial scar was identified as a zone with intense cell-cell communication, with prominent ApoE-Trem2 signaling pathway modulating microglial activation. For each of the three major glial populations, an inflammatory-responsive state, resembling the reactive states observed in neurodegenerative contexts, was observed. The recovered spectrum of ischemia-induced oligodendrocyte states supports the emerging hypothesis that oligodendrocytes actively respond to and modulate the neuroinflammatory stimulus. The findings are further supported by analysis of other spatial transcriptomic datasets from different mouse models of ischemic brain injury. Collectively, we present a landmark transcriptomic dataset accompanied by interactive visualization that provides a comprehensive view of spatiotemporal organization of processes in the postischemic mouse brain.">

        <tr id="Post-mortem studies have shown that patients dying from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection frequently have pathological changes in their CNS, particularly in the brainstem. Many of these changes are proposed to result from para-infectious and/or post-infection immune responses. Clinical symptoms such as fatigue, breathlessness, and chest pain are frequently reported in post-hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We propose that these symptoms are in part due to damage to key neuromodulatory brainstem nuclei. While brainstem involvement has been demonstrated in the acute phase of the illness, the evidence of long-term brainstem change on MRI is inconclusive. We therefore used ultra-high field (7 T) quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to test the hypothesis that brainstem abnormalities persist in post-COVID patients and that these are associated with persistence of key symptoms. We used 7 T QSM data from 30 patients, scanned 93-548 days after hospital admission for COVID-19 and compared them to 51 age-matched controls without prior history of COVID-19 infection. We correlated the patients' QSM signals with disease severity (duration of hospital admission and COVID-19 severity scale), inflammatory response during the acute illness (C-reactive protein, D-dimer and platelet levels), functional recovery (modified Rankin scale), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7). In COVID-19 survivors, the MR susceptibility increased in the medulla, pons and midbrain regions of the brainstem. Specifically, there was increased susceptibility in the inferior medullary reticular formation and the raphe pallidus and obscurus. In these regions, patients with higher tissue susceptibility had worse acute disease severity, higher acute inflammatory markers, and significantly worse functional recovery. This study contributes to understanding the long-term effects of COVID-19 and recovery. Using non-invasive ultra-high field 7 T MRI, we show evidence of brainstem pathophysiological changes associated with inflammatory processes in post-hospitalized COVID-19 survivors.">

        <tr id="Background: Long COVID-19 is an emerging chronic illness of significant public health concern due to a myriad of neuropsychiatric sequelae, including increased suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). Methods: This review provides a concise synthesis of clinical evidence that points toward the dysfunction of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system, as a potential shared pathology between SI/SB and COVID-19. Results: Depression, a suicide risk factor, and SI/SB were both associated with reduced frequencies of various astrocyte subsets and complex proteomic/transcriptional changes of astrocyte-related markers in a brain-region-specific manner. Astrocyte-related circulating markers were increased in depressed subjects and, to a less consistent extent, in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, reactive astrocytosis was observed in subjects with SI/SB and those with COVID-19. Conclusions: Astrocyte dysfunctions occurred in depression, SI/SB, and COVID-19. Reactive-astrocyte-mediated loss of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity and subsequent neuroinflammation—a factor previously linked to SI/SB development—might contribute to increased suicide in individuals with long COVID-19. As such, the formulation of new therapeutic strategies to restore astrocyte homeostasis, enhance BBB integrity, and mitigate neuroinflammation may reduce SI/SB-associated neuropsychiatric manifestations among long COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and long COVID are debilitating multisystemic conditions sharing similarities in immune dysregulation and cellular signaling pathways contributing to the pathophysiology. In this study, immune exhaustion gene expression was investigated in participants with ME/CFS or long COVID concurrently. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from participants with ME/CFS (n = 14), participants with long COVID (n = 15), and healthy controls (n = 18). Participants with ME/CFS were included according to Canadian Consensus Criteria. Participants with long COVID were eligible according to the case definition for “Post COVID-19 Condition” published by the World Health Organization. RNA was analyzed using the NanoString nCounter Immune Exhaustion gene expression panel. Differential gene expression analysis in ME/CFS revealed downregulated IFN signaling and immunoglobulin genes, and this suggested a state of immune suppression. Pathway analysis implicated dysregulated macrophage activation, cytokine production, and immunodeficiency signaling. Long COVID samples exhibited dysregulated expression of genes regarding antigen presentation, cytokine signaling, and immune activation. Differentially expressed genes were associated with antigen presentation, B cell development, macrophage activation, and cytokine signaling. This investigation elucidates the intricate role of both adaptive and innate immune dysregulation underlying ME/CFS and long COVID, emphasizing the potential importance of immune exhaustion in disease progression.">

        <tr id="The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system plays a pivotal role in the immune response to viral infections, mediating the presentation of viral peptides to T cells and influencing both the strength and specificity of the host immune response. Variations in HLA genotypes across individuals lead to differences in susceptibility to viral infection and severity of illness. This study uses observations from the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how specific HLA class I molecules affect clinical responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By analyzing paired high-resolution HLA types and viral genomic sequences from 60 patients, we assess the relationship between predicted HLA class I peptide binding repertoires and infection severity as measured by the sequential organ failure assessment score. This approach leverages functional convergence across HLA-C alleles to identify relationships that may otherwise be inaccessible due to allelic diversity and limitations in sample size. Surprisingly, our findings show that severely symptomatic infection in this cohort is associated with disproportionately abundant binding of SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural protein epitopes by patient HLA-C molecules. In addition, the extent of overlap between a given patient’s predicted HLA-C and HLA-A peptide binding repertoires correlates with worse prognoses in this cohort. The findings highlight immunologic mechanisms linking HLA-C molecules with the human response to viral pathogens that warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="Normal aging, though lacking widespread neurodegeneration, is nevertheless characterized by cognitive impairment in learning, memory, and executive function. The aged brain is spared from neuron loss, but white matter is lost and damage to myelin sheaths accumulates. This myelin damage is strongly associated with cognitive impairment. Although the cause of the myelin damage is not known, microglia dysregulation is a likely contributor. Immunologic proteins interact with microglial receptors to modulate microglia-mediated phagocytosis, which mediates myelin damage clearance and turn-over. Two such proteins, “eat me” signal C1q and “don’t eat me” signal CD47, act in opposition with microglia. Both C1q and CD47 have been implicated in Multiple Sclerosis, a demyelinating disease, but whether they play a role in age-related myelin pathology is currently unknown. The present study investigates C1q and CD47 in relation to age-related myelin degeneration using multilabel immunofluorescence, RNAscope, and confocal microscopy in the cingulum bundle of male and female rhesus monkeys across the lifespan. Our findings showed significant age-related elevation in C1q localized to myelin basic protein, and this increase is associated with more severe cognitive impairment. In contrast, CD47 localization to myelin decreased in middle age and oligodendrocyte expression of CD47 RNA decreased with age. Lastly, microglia reactivity increased with age in association with the changes in C1q and CD47. Together, these results suggest disruption in the balance of “eat me” and “don’t eat me” signals during normal aging, biasing microglia toward increased reactivity and phagocytosis of myelin, resulting in cognitive deficits.">

Here, we performed an analysis of epitope data curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). We found that the patterns of immunodominance of seasonal influenza viruses circulating in humans and H5N1 are similar. We further conclude that a significant fraction of the T cell epitopes is conserved at a level associated with cross-reactivity between avian and seasonal sequences, and we further experimentally demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity in the most dominant T cell epitopes curated in the IEDB. Based on these observations, and the overall similarity of the neuraminidase (NA) N1 subtype encoded in both HPAI and seasonal H1N1 influenza virus as well as cross-reactive group 1 HA stalk-reactive antibodies, we expect that a degree of pre-existing immunity is present in the general human population that could blunt the severity of human H5N1 infections.">

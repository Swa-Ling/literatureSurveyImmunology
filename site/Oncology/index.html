        <tr id="By the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had diffused widely across the globe, with 770 million infected individuals and over 7 million deaths reported. In addition to its high infectivity and pathogenicity and its rapid mutation rate, the unique capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to circumvent the immune system has also contributed to the widespread nature of this pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 elicits the onset of innate immune system activation and initiates antiviral responses once it has infected the host. While battling the host’s immune responses, SARS-CoV-2 has established many countermeasures to evade attack and clearance. As the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 continues, substantial evidence has revealed that the 29 proteins synthesized by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are integral to the viral infection process. They not only facilitate viral replication and transmission, but also assist SARS-CoV-2 in escaping the host’s immune defenses, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets that have attracted considerable attention in recent studies. This review summarizes the manner in which SARS-CoV-2 interfaces with the innate immune system, with a particular focus on the continuous evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications of mutations.">

        <tr id="The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has threatened human health worldwide. Among protective immune reactions, T cell responses are diverse among individuals, which is related to the differences in severity. A T cell subset, regulatory T (Treg) cells, is crucial for limiting excessive immune responses. If SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs are developed during infection, they may counteract anti-viral immunity and cause severe symptom. To address this possibility, we conducted single-cell TCR-RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Among thirteen donors, one with severe symptom had substantially more FOXP3-expressing Treg clonotypes activated in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virion or other major antigen proteins. To define the reactivity of these Treg clonotypes, fifteen highly expanded Treg clonotypes were reconstituted into reporter cells and stimulated with 27 distinct peptide pools that cover all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, none of these clonotypes react to any SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Instead, the reporter cells expressing one TCR clonotype (23599) were activated in the presence of EBV-transformed B cells without adding exogenous antigens. Furthermore, 23599 TCR-expressing cells were activated by non-transformed naïve syngenic B cells in DQA1*03:03-DQB1*04:01-dependent manner, suggesting that clonotype 23599 may be autoreactive. This Treg clonotype, 23599, was also detected in a public TCR database, and significantly expanded in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy donors. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not the dominant antigen inducing Treg during infection.">

        <tr id="Understanding the early interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human airway epithelial cells is essential for unraveling viral replication and spread mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the early dynamics of airway epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection using well-differentiated human nasal and tracheal epithelial cell cultures by incorporating three publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We identified a previously uncharacterized cell population, termed virus-rich intermediate (VRI) cells, representing an intermediate differentiation stage between basal and ciliated cells. These VRI cells exhibited high viral loads at all infection time points, strong interferon and inflammatory responses, increased mRNA expression of microvilli-related genes (PAK1, PAK4, VIL1), and suppression of apoptosis markers (BAX, CASP3) alongside increased anti-apoptotic gene expression (BCL2). Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that VRI cells send signals to basal cells via receptor-ligand pathways such as EPHA and VEGF, likely promoting basal cell differentiation and proliferation through MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes VRI cells as a primary site for replication and spread, leveraging these cells’ unique differentiation state to evade host cell death and facilitate viral propagation. This study provides insights into the early cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights potential therapeutic targets to limit viral spread.">

        <tr id="Severity of COVID-19 is affected by multiple factors; however, it is not understood how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure affects the control of viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that immune events in the mouse lung closely preceding SARS-CoV-2 infection affect viral control and identify innate immune pathways that limit viral replication. Pulmonary inflammatory stimuli including resolved, antecedent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus or influenza, ongoing pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma, or airway administration of TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines all establish an antiviral state in the lung that restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to antiviral type I interferons, TNFα and IL-1 potently precondition the lung for enhanced viral control. Our work shows that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and suggests that heterogeneity in pulmonary inflammation preceding SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to variability in disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a pivotal role in the immune response against viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. However, our understanding of memory NK cell responses in the context of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited. To address this, we investigated the memory-like response of NK cells to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, presented by autologous cells. Blood samples from 45 donors underwent analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, categorizing them into four groups based on the antibody kind and level. NK cells from SARS-CoV-2-experienced donors demonstrated enhanced degranulation and activation levels, IFNγ production and proliferative potential in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Investigation of highly proliferating NK cells demonstrated the formation of distinct clusters depending on the SARS-CoV-2 peptide supplementation and the donor group. RNA sequencing revealed differential gene expression patterns, highlighting metabolism, protein transport, and immune response genes. Notably, KIR2DS4 expression correlated with enhanced IFNγ production, degranulation and proliferation levels, suggesting a role in SARS-CoV-2 recognition. Collectively, these findings provide detailed insights into antigen-specific NK cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, indicating potential mechanisms underlying NK cell activation in antiviral immunity.">

Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B and T lymphocytes in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

Currently, the Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the most dominant. The most prominent symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory. Meanwhile, the fatality of COVID-19 was mainly from pneumonia. However ,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have pneumonia and those who do not, the differences in the immune repertoire still require further investigation.We conducted seven-chain adaptome immune repertoire analyses on patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, both with and without pulmonary infiltration.Patients with pulmonary infiltration exhibit lymphopenia, a decreased proportion of the overall TCR repertoire alongside an increased BCR repertoire, reduced IGHD and IGHM isotype expression, a shorter mean CDR3 length for TRG, and a longer mean length for TRD, as well as diminished clonality and diversity in the TCR/BCR repertoire. Meanwhile, patients with pulmonary infiltration have distinct V-J gene usage and unique CDR3 signature, as well as BCR class switch recombination pattern. Finally, prior vaccination triggered less BCR IGHM/IGHD somatic hypermutation response, preserved the diversity of the entire adaptive immune repertoire, and provided clinical protection against severe or critical conditions following Omicron infection.We report a unique, comprehensive adaptive immune system signature in patients with pulmonary infiltration, which may serve as potential immunological biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

While treatments have been developed to reduce morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, more antivirals with broad-spectrum activities are still needed. Here we identified lonafarnib (LNF), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug inhibitor of cellular farnesyltransferase (FTase), as an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent. LNF inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and acted synergistically with known anti-SARS antivirals. LNF was equally active against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants. Mechanistic studies suggested that LNF targeted multiple steps of viral life cycle. Using other structurally diverse FTase inhibitors and LNF-resistant FTase mutant, we demonstrated a key role of FTase in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. To demonstrate in vivo efficacy, we infected SARS-CoV-2 susceptible humanized mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and treated them with LNF. LNF at clinically relevant dose suppressed viral titer in the respiratory tract and improved pulmonary pathology and clinical parameters. Our study demonstrated that LNF, an approved oral drug with excellent human safety data, is a promising antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that warrants further clinical assessment for treatment of COVID-19 and potentially other viral infections.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of COVID-19, led to an ongoing pandemic with devastating consequences for the global economy and human health. With the global spread of SARS-CoV-2, multidisciplinary initiatives were launched to explore new diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccination strategies. From this perspective, proteomics could help to understand the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify new therapeutic options. A TMT-based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis was performed to study the proteome remodeling of human lung alveolar cells expressing human ACE2 (A549-ACE2) after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Detectability and the prognostic value of selected proteins was analyzed by targeted PRM. A total of 6802 proteins and 6428 phospho-sites were identified in A549-ACE2 cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The differential proteins here identified revealed that A549-ACE2 cells undergo a time-dependent regulation of essential processes, delineating the precise intervention of the cellular machinery by the viral proteins. From this mechanistic background and by applying machine learning modeling, 29 differential proteins were selected and detected in the serum of COVID-19 patients, 14 of which showed promising prognostic capacity. Targeting these proteins and the protein kinases responsible for the reported phosphorylation changes may provide efficient alternative strategies for the clinical management of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The persistence of RNA viruses in the brain is increasingly recognized as a significant factor in the progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This phenomenon is particularly evident in infections caused by various neurotropic and non-neurotropic viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgent need to explore the complex relationship between viral persistence and neurological decline. Growing evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 affects brain structure and function, although the precise molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Chronic neuroinflammation induced by viral infections is thought to accelerate age-related neurodegeneration. While the immune system typically clears many viral infections in the brain, some viruses establish chronic infections, leading to restricted viral replication. These persistent infections can exacerbate neuroinflammation and contribute to ongoing neuronal damage, key drivers of age-related neurodegeneration. This review explores current knowledge on how SARS-CoV-2 infiltrates the brain, evades immune defenses, and persists within brain cells, potentially using them as viral reservoirs. As individuals age, the cumulative effects of such viral infections may accelerate cognitive decline and increase vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of viral persistence and its long-term impact on brain health is crucial for developing targeted therapies to combat these age-related diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract As the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continues to evolve and infect the global population, many individuals are likely to suffer from post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Manifestations of PASC include vision symptoms, but little is known about the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and impact the retinal cells. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and perturb the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in vivo, after intranasal inoculation of a transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in cell culture. Separate lentiviral studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mediates viral entry and replication in RPE cells, while the Envelope and ORF3a proteins induce morphological changes. Infection with major variants of SARS-CoV-2 compromised the RPE barrier function and phagocytic capacity. It also caused complement activation and production of cytokines and chemokines, resulting in an inflammatory response that spread across the RPE layer. This inflammatory signature has similarities to that associated with the onset of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of human blindness, resulting from RPE pathology that eventually leads to photoreceptor cell loss. Thus, our findings suggest that post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the RPE may have long-term implications for vision, perhaps comparable to the increased occurrence of AMD found among individuals infected by HIV, but with greater public health consequences due to the much larger number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="It has been reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in long-term neurological symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, however the specific mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Initially, we confirmed a reduction in the level of synaptic proteins in SH-SY5Y neurons following SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 Nsps are crucial for the efficient replication of the virus and play important roles in the interaction between virus and host cell. Nsps screening experiments implied that Nsp7 is able to reduce the level of synapsin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Nsp7 in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse primary neurons demonstrated that Nsp7 could decrease the levels of synaptic proteins without affecting neuronal viability. Moreover, C57BL/6 mice receiving AAV-GFP-Nsp7 injections into the ventral hippocampus displayed impaired memory ability, along with reduced dendritic spine density and synaptic protein levels. Mechanistic investigations suggested that Nsp7-induced mitochondrial damage led to ROS production and ATP levels decreasing in neurons. Additional experiments employing the ROS inhibitor NAC demonstrated that Nsp7 suppressed the expression of synaptic proteins via ROS inducing, implicating mitochondrial dysfunction in synaptic plasticity impairment and subsequent cognitive dysfunction. Our findings underscore the crucial role of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7 in cognitive dysfunction, which is potentially mediated through impaired synaptic plasticity via mitochondrial damage. This study enhances our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying central nervous system-related symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background To date, it is still not clear why during the COVID-19 pandemic children generally developed no or milder symptoms compared to adults. As innate immune responses are crucial in the early defense against pathogens, we aimed at profiling these responses from both adults and children with a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In the first months of the pandemic, PBMCs and serum were collected from peripheral blood of adults and children at different time points after testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive (PCR+). The levels of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific IgG were measured in serum. The cells were cultured for 24 hours in medium only, with heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (iSARS-CoV-2) or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. The levels of secreted cytokines/chemokines as well as monocyte phenotype were determined. Results Few days after testing PCR+, PBMCs from PCR+ children secreted higher levels of cytokines/chemokines compared to PCR+ adults, after these cells were incubated either in medium only or after stimulation with iSARS-CoV-2 or TLR ligands. Furthermore, PBMCs from children stimulated with iSARS-CoV-2 secreted significantly higher levels of IL-10 and GM-CSF compared to PBMCs from control children. In contrast, PBMCs from the PCR+ adults secreted lower levels of IL-8 compared to adult controls. Phenotypic analysis of monocytes indicates a smaller proportion non-classical monocytes for adults compared to children. The distinct cytokine profiles, symptom severity, and the proportion of non-classical monocytes correlated to each other. The levels of Spike-specific IgG overtime did not significantly differ between children and adults. Conclusions Within the first week after testing PCR+, children showed a stronger inflammatory innate immune profile and experienced less severe symptoms compared to adults. Our data implies correlations between the secretion of cytokines/chemokines, proportion of non-classical monocytes, and symptoms severity. These findings enhance our understanding of the distinct pediatric and adult innate immune profile after SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the knowledge necessary to improve future prevention strategies.">

It has infected billions of people worldwide with >6 million deaths. With expedited development of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs, there have been significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated mortalities and morbidities. The virus is closely related to SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2003 and infected several thousand people with a higher mortality rate of ∼10%. Because of continued viral evolution and drug-induced resistance, as well as the possibility of a new coronavirus in the future, studies for new therapies are needed. The viral methyltransferases play critical roles in SARS coronavirus replication and are therefore promising drug targets. This review summarizes the function, structure and inhibition of methyltransferases of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Challenges and perspectives of targeting the viral methyltransferases to treat viral infections are discussed.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to numerous cases of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), worldwide. This co-infection has increased patient mortality due to the lack of efficient bi-targeted drugs. Cambogin, a bioactive natural product, has been shown to effectively induce regression of KSHV-latently infected tumours in xenograft mice models; however, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Here, we report that Cambogin targets 46 host genes commonly affected by both SARS-CoV-2 and KSHV infections, as identified through bioinformatics analysis. These genes are related with 14 key upstream signalling pathways, particularly those involved in inflammation regulation, protein phosphorylation, metabolic processes, and cellular stress response. Within the transcriptional factor (TF)-miRNA co-regulatory network, ten out of 46 hub-target genes are closely linked to Cambogin and KSHV/SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, Cambogin not only efficiently blocks the replication and virion production of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo by reducing the expression of EGFR and Cyclin A2, but also simultaneously inhibits both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the growth of KSHV-induced tumours in vivo using a murine xenograft model. These findings provide an alternative strategy for the potential use of Cambogin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients, particularly those with KSHV co-infection.">

        <tr id="Genetic variations in MS4A4A and MS4A6A are linked to the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels and are associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk and progression. Using CRISPR knockout and MS4A4A-degrading antibodies in primary human microglia, non-human primates (NHP), and a xenotransplantation model of amyloid pathology, we provide evidence that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are negative regulators of both the transmembrane and soluble TREM2 proteins. They also negatively regulate microglia proliferation, survival, metabolism, lysosomal function, energetics, phagocytosis, and disease-fighting states. Mechanistically, we find that MS4A4A exerts negative regulation by interacting with MS4A6A and protecting it from degradation. MS4A6A in turn forms a complex with and blocks the co-receptor DAP12, which is required for the stability, cell surface localization, and signaling of TREM2 and other receptors. Taken together, the data indicate that MS4A4A and MS4A6A are cooperating, post-transcriptional negative regulators of TREM2 and microglial function, and potential drug targets for AD.">

Infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may presently be treated with less than 10 antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir. The need for medical intervention due to sickness has led to unprecedented research efforts to study the biology of coronaviruses. Additionally, there is a strong likelihood that coronaviruses will cause pandemics in the future. All viruses cannot replicate optimally due to host restriction factors. Given that they are genetically more stable than viral targets and may be shared by similar viruses, these antiviral host factors provide appealing targets for antiviral treatment. The identification of antiviral host factors that are a component of human innate immunity and that prevent the completion of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle has been made possible by the deployment of several “omics” technologies. In this review, we provide an overview of the antiviral host factors that limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in this, which were mostly discovered using functional genetic and interactome screening. Important cellular mechanisms for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle are covered. Finally, we highlight host restriction factors that could be targeted by clinically approved molecules and the induction of these factors as potential antiviral therapies for COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Long Covid is defined by a wide range of symptoms that persist after the acute phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Commonly reported symptoms include fatigue, weakness, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction, with many other symptoms reported. Symptom range, duration, and severity are highly variable and partially overlap with symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and other post-acute infectious syndromes, highlighting opportunities to define shared mechanisms of pathogenesis. Potential mechanisms of Long Covid are diverse, including persistence of viral reservoirs, dysregulated immune responses, direct viral damage of tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, inflammation driven by reactivation of latent viral infections, vascular endothelium activation or dysfunction, and subsequent thromboinflammation, autoimmunity, metabolic derangements, microglial activation, and microbiota dysbiosis. The heterogeneity of symptoms and baseline characteristics of people with Long Covid, as well as the varying states of immunity and therapies given at the time of acute infection, have made etiologies of Long Covid difficult to determine. Here, we examine progress on preclinical models for Long Covid and review progress being made in clinical trials, highlighting the need for large human studies and further development of models to better understand Long Covid.

        <tr id="Abstract Up to one-third of individuals suffering from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection with the onset of severe-to-mild diseases could develop several symptoms of neurological disorders, which could last long after resolving the infection, known as neuro-COVID. Effective therapeutic treatments for neuro-COVID remain unavailable, in part, due to the absence of animal models for studying its underlying mechanisms and developing medical countermeasures against it. Here, we explored the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the well-being of respiratory and neurological functions of BALB/c mice by using a clinical isolate of β-variant, i.e. B.1.351. We found that this β-variant of SARS-CoV-2 primarily infected the lungs, causing tissue damage, profound inflammatory responses, altered respiratory functions and transient but significant hypoxia. Although live progeny viruses could not be isolated, viral RNAs were detected across many anatomical regions of the brains in most challenged mice and triggered activation of genes encoding for NF-kB, IL-6, IP-10 and RANTES and microglial cells. We noted that the significantly activated IL-6-encoded gene persisted at 4 weeks after infection. Together, these results suggest that this B.1.351/BALB/c model of SARS-CoV-2 infection warrants further studies to establish it as a desirable model for studies of neuropathogenesis and the development of effective therapeutics of neuro-COVID.">

        <tr id="Extensive research has been conducted on the SARS-CoV-2 virus in association with various infectious diseases to understand the pathophysiology of the infection and potential co-infections. In tropical countries, exposure to local viruses may alter the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and coinfection. Notably, only a portion of the antibodies produced against SARS-CoV-2 proteins demonstrate neutralizing properties, and the immune response following natural infection tends to be temporary. In contrast, long-lasting IgG antibodies are common after dengue virus infections. In cases where preexisting antibodies from an initial dengue virus infection bind to a different dengue serotype during a subsequent infection, there is a potential for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and the formation of immune complexes associated with disease severity. Both SARS-CoV-2 and dengue infections can result in immunodeficiency. Viral proteins of both viruses interfere with the host’s IFN-I signaling. Additionally, a cytokine storm can occur after viral infection, impairing a proper response, and autoantibodies against a wide array of proteins can appear during convalescence. Most of the reported autoantibodies are typically short-lived. Vaccines against both viruses alter the immune response, affecting the course of viral infection and enhancing clearance. A comprehensive analysis of both viral infections and pathogenicity is revisited to prevent infection, severity, and mortality.">

The persistent effects of COVID-19 have become a subject of significant concern amongst the medical and scientific community. This article aims to explore the probability of a link between the COVID-19 infection and the risk of lung cancer development. First, this article reports that SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammatory response and cellular stress, potentially leading to tumorigenesis through common pathways between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer. These pathways include the JAK/STAT3 pathway which is activated after the initiation of cytokine storm following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This pathway is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune homeostasis. The JAK/STAT3 pathway is also hyperactivated in lung cancer which serves as a link thereof. It predisposes patients to lung cancer through myriad molecular mechanisms such as DNA damage, genomic instability, and cell cycle dysregulation. Another probable pathway to tumorigenesis is based on the possibility of an oncogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 through hijacking the p53 protein, leading to cell oxidative stress and interfering with the DNA repair mechanisms. Finally, this article highlights the overexpression of the SLC22A18 gene in lung cancer. This gene can be overexpressed by the ZEB1 transcription factor, which was found to be highly expressed during COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the worst pandemics in human history. The causative virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can invade host cells in multiple organs by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II expressed on the cell surface. Once inside the host cell, viral replication takes place, leading to cellular disruption and the release of signal molecules that are recognised by the innate immune system. Innate immunity activation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and primes the adaptive immune system. The proinflammatory environment defends against further viral entry and replication. SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to lead to myocardial injury through several mechanisms. Firstly, direct viral-mediated cellular invasion of cardiomyocytes has been shown in in vitro and histological studies, which is related to cellular injury. Secondly, the proinflammatory state during COVID-19 can lead to myocardial injury and the release of protein remnants of the cardiac contractile machinery. Thirdly, the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is associated with thromboembolism of coronary arteries and/or other vascular systems. COVID-19 patients can also develop heart failure; however, the underlying mechanism is much less well-characterised than for myocardial injury. Several questions remain regarding COVID-19-related heart failure, including its potential reversibility, the role of anti-viral medications in its prevention, and the mechanisms underlying heart failure pathogenesis in long COVID-19. Further work is required to improve our understanding of the mechanism of cardiac sequelae in COVID-19, which may enable us to target SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients against longer-lasting cardiovascular complications.">

As the world is recovering with improving vaccines and antiviral treatments, the alarming rate of long-COVID, or Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), calls for further investigations. Among a list of symptoms associated with multi-organ dysfunctions, the neurological complications are particularly intriguing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, driven by the novel coronavirus and its variants, has caused over 518 million infections and 6.25 million deaths globally, leading to a significant health crisis. Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury. Additionally, neurological complications, including cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation, have been observed in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to acute kidney injury, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), emphasizing its effects on pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance, and the regulation of gluconeogenesis. We also explore how SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological complications, detailing the intricate pathways of neuro-invasion and the potential to trigger conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By elucidating the metabolic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, this review underscores the imperative for continued research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term and short-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Although the direct infection caused by virus invasion is important for the pathobiology of COVID-19, the hyperinflammatory response and tissue injury are major contributors in critically ill patients. As a host sensor, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognizes multiple pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), producing various inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cell death signals, which are central to the inflammatory pathology observed in COVID-19. The objectives of this narrative review are to summarize the role of TLR2 activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and emphasize the importance of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in TLR2 activation. Additionally, we presented some compounds related to TLR2 regulation clinically or experimentally, which may provide new insights into targets for pharmaceutical discovery and development.">

        <tr id="Myeloid cells maintain tissue homeostasis via the recognition, engulfment, and lysosomal clearance of dying cells and cellular debris, which is often accompanied by changes from homeostatic to reactive states. While a role for phagocytic receptors in gating these transitions has been described1,2, less is known about if and how lysosomes can contribute to transcriptional and functional plasticity. To determine how lysosomal health impacts myeloid cell states, we evaluated microglia and macrophages deficient for progranulin (encoded by Grn), a lysosomal protein with pleiotropic functions whose loss is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases3–8. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the aged mouse brain identified a Grn knockout (KO)-specific microglial subpopulation marked by high GPNMB expression that displays hallmarks of lysosomal dysfunction, including lipofuscin accumulation. Epigenetic analysis of aged microglia revealed MITF/TFE transcription factors as key mediators of the transcriptional states associated with Grn deficiency. In addition to identifying a core myeloid cell transcriptional response to diverse lysosomal stressors, targeted perturbations of various lysosomal properties in vitro uncovered a cell autonomous, TREM2- independent, response to lysosomal deacidification (via v-ATPase or VPS34 loss of function) that overlaps with Grn KO microglia phenotypes, including the induction of a lysosomal gene program, increased proliferation, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Compound loss-of-function approaches established GPNMB upregulation upon lysosomal stress is required for the compensatory response to enhance lysosomal function via promoting acidification. Finally, pharmacological endolysosomal reacidification through sodium/proton exchanger inhibition partially rescued Grn KO microglia phenotypes. Overall, these data establish a fundamental link between lysosomal health and myeloid cell epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional states observed in neurodegeneration models.">

Alarmingly, approximately one in four individuals diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience varying degrees of cognitive impairment, raising concerns about a potential increase in neurological sequelae cases. Neuroinflammation seems to be the key pathophysiological hallmark linking mild respiratory COVID-19 to cognitive impairment, fatigue, and neurological sequelae in COVID-19 patients, highlighting the interaction between the nervous and immune systems following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the virus disrupts physiological pathways to trigger inflammation within the CNS, potentially leading to neuronal damage. These include neuroinvasion, systemic inflammation, disruption of the lung and gut-brain axes, and reactivation of latent viruses. This review explores the potential origins of neuroinflammation and the underlying neuroimmune cross-talk, highlighting important unanswered questions in the field. Addressing these fundamental issues could enhance our understanding of the virus's impact on the CNS and inform strategies to mitigate its detrimental effects.">

Functionality and magnitude of acute SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were evaluated, in addition to antibody responses. Most individuals with acute COVID-19 developed SARS2-specific T cell responses within 6 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Early CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell responses were polyfunctional, and both strongly associated with reduced upper respiratory tract SARS2 viral RNA, independent of neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, these findings provide evidence for protective roles for circulating SARS2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2; over the course of the disease, a dysregulated immune response leads to excessive inflammation that damages lung parenchyma and compromises its function. One of the cell lineages classically associated with pathological inflammatory processes is mast cells (MCs). MCs and their mediators have been associated with COVID-19; we previously reported the role of carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) in severe COVID-19. However, sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been poorly studied. In patients who successfully resolve the infection, one of the reported sequelae is pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The etiology and exact mechanisms are unknown, and few studies exist. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether MCs are associated with PF development after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings demonstrate that during severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an increased amount of CPA3+ MCs in areas with pneumonia, around thrombotic blood vessels, and in fibrotic tissue. Moreover, higher numbers of CPA3-expressing MCs correlate with fibrotic tissue development (r = 0.8323; p = 0.001170). These results suggest that during COVID-19, exacerbated inflammation favors the recruitment or expansion of MCs and CPA3 expression in the lungs, which favors tissue damage and a failure of repair mechanisms, leading to fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Following viral infection, antigen-restricted T lymphocytes are activated and recognize infected cells to eliminate them. A subset of T cells differentiates into memory lymphocytes able to counteract viral rechallenge in a faster and enhanced way. SARS-CoV-2 can escape immune responses leading to a poor clinical outcome. Immune escape can be associated with the failure of the development of T cell memory compartments. The aim of this study is to characterize the T memory subsets and to test the immune response against class I- and II-restricted immunodominant epitopes shared by ancestral and SARS-CoV-2 variants strains. T memory subsets and recognition of SARS-CoV-2S Spike-specific epitopes were analyzed by flow cytometry on 14 fully vaccinated healthy donors (HDV) and 18 COVID-19 recovered patients (CD). The results obtained showed that CD8+ T naïve subset numbers decreased in association with a significant increase of the effector memory T cell subset whereas there was a small increase in the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-restricted T clones in both CD4+ and CD8+ subset in the CD compared to HDV sample. Collectively, these features may reflect a broader cytotoxic T cell repertoire stimulated by the virus during the natural infection compared to the spike-restricted response activated during vaccination.">

This investigation was designed as a qualitative, cross-sectional, comparative, and randomized observational study. Samples were collected through nasal/oral swabs from patients symptomatic for influenza syndrome or SARS. Patients were categorized into three groups: DVAC (patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccinated), DNVAC (patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and not vaccinated), and ND (patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection). SARS-CoV-2 was detected through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Gene expressions of IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-1RN were also evaluated using RT-PCR. Statistically significant differences in IL-8 expression were observed among the study groups (P = 0.033); moreover, clinical signs and symptoms, frequency of hospitalizations, and need for intensive care units showed significant differences. These differences were noted in the DVAC group compared with those in the DNVAC and ND groups. Patients with COVID-19 showed reduced IL-8 expression compared with those with other diseases that also cause influenza syndrome or SARS. These results suggested that the severity of clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 reduced after the initial two doses of the CoronaVac/Sinovac vaccine. Moreover, this vaccine reduced mortality and lethality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with malignancies, particularly those with CML. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on CML cell viability and the protective role of vitamin K2 (VK2) in conjunction with imatinib. Experiments conducted on K562 CML cells demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein induces cytotoxicity and activates caspase 3/7, which are key markers of apoptosis. VK2 mitigated these cytotoxic effects and decreased cytokine production while inhibiting colony formation. Furthermore, the combination of VK2 with imatinib significantly reduced cellular proliferation, diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, and markedly suppressed colony formation. These findings suggest that VK2 protects CML cells from SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxicity and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of imatinib, presenting a potential strategy to improve CML treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.">

In particular, in our paper, we elaborate on the aspects related to the possible correlation of transposable HERV elements’ activation and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein’s presence in cells of COVID-19 patients or upon COVID-19 vaccination with implications for natural and adaptive immunity. In particular, the release of cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 occurs in such cases and plays a notable role in sustaining chronic inflammation. Moreover, well-known interindividual variations of HERVs might partially account for the interpersonal variability of COVID-19 symptoms or unwanted events post-vaccination.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has underscored the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Recent studies have revealed a complex interplay between the circadian clock and SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cells, opening new avenues for targeted interventions. This systems pharmacology study investigates this intricate relationship, focusing on the circadian protein BMAL1. BMAL1 plays a dual role in viral dynamics, driving the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2 while suppressing interferon-stimulated antiviral genes. Its critical position at the host-pathogen interface suggests potential as a therapeutic target, albeit requiring a nuanced approach to avoid disrupting essential circadian regulation. To enable precise tuning of potential interventions, we constructed a computational model integrating the lung cellular clock with viral infection components. We validated this model against literature data to establish a platform for drug administration simulation studies using the REV-ERB agonist SR9009. Our simulations of optimized SR9009 dosing reveal circadian-based strategies that potentially suppress viral infection while minimizing clock disruption. This quantitative framework offers insights into the viral-circadian interface, aiming to guide the development of chronotherapy-based antivirals. More broadly, it underscores the importance of understanding the connections between circadian timing, respiratory viral infections, and therapeutic responses for advancing precision medicine. Such approaches are vital for responding effectively to the rapid spread of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The cytokine storm associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the most distinctive pathological signatures in COVID-19 patients. Macrophages respond to this pro-inflammatory challenge by reprogramming their functional and metabolic phenotypes. Interestingly, human macrophages fail to express the inducible form of the NO synthase (NOS2) in response to pro-inflammatory activation and, therefore, NO is not synthesized by these cells. The contribution of exogenously added NO, via a chemical NO-donor, on the immunometabolic changes associated with the cytokine storm is investigated. By using metabolic, transcriptomic, and functional assays the effect of NO in human macrophages is evaluated and found specific responses. Moreover, through integrative fluxomic analysis, pathways modified by NO that contribute to the expression of a particular phenotype in human macrophages are identified, which includes a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and TCA with a slight increase in the glycolytic flux. A significant ROS increase and preserved cell viability are observed in the presence of NO, which may ease the inflammatory response and host defense. Also, NO reverses the cytokine storm-induced itaconate accumulation. These changes offer additional clues to understanding the potential crosstalk between NO and the COVID-19 cytokine storm-dependent signaling pathways.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 and other pandemic viruses continue being important for public health and the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 more deeply, particularly its association with inflammatory and antiviral processes. In this study, we used the RNA-seq technique to analyze mRNA and non-coding RNA profiles of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals after SARS-CoV-2 in vitro exposure, to identify pathways related to immune response and the regulatory post-transcriptional mechanisms triggered that can serve as possible complementary therapeutic targets. Our analyses show that SARS-CoV-2 induced a significant regulation in the expression of 790 genes in PBMCs, of which 733 correspond to mRNAs and 57 to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The immune response, antiviral response, signaling, cell proliferation and metabolism are the main biological processes involved. Among these, the inflammatory response groups the majority of regulated genes with an increase in the expression of chemokines involved in the recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and T-cells. Additionally, it was observed that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 induces the expression of genes related to the IL-27 pathway but not of IFN-I or IFN-III, indicating the induction of ISGs through this pathway rather than the IFN genes. Moreover, several lncRNA and RNA binding proteins that can act in the cis-regulation of genes of the IL-27 pathway were identified. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can regulate the expression of multiple genes in PBMCs, mainly related to the inflammatory and antiviral response. Among these, lncRNAs establish an important mechanism in regulating the immune response to the virus. They could contribute to developing severe forms of COVID-19, constituting a possible therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Background: The pathogenesis of Severe SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to severe immune responses and inflammation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this context, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) has a crucial role in inhibiting cytokine-induced immune responses. On the other hand, interleukin-29 (IL-29) and lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) are important molecules involved in inducing immune responses. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the mRNA levels of SOCS1, IL-29, and LYST in the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe symptoms. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 70 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with severe symptoms and 70 healthy controls were evaluated. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood and after cDNA synthesis, the mRNA levels of SOCS1, IL-29, and LYST were assessed by Real-Time PCR technique Results: The study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients exhibited a significant increase in mRNA levels of IL-29 compared to healthy individuals. However, there were no observed alterations in the mRNA levels of SOCS1 and LYST in the patient group. Conclusions: The results emphasize the importance of IL-29 as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 cases. Further research is needed to investigate the specific mechanisms through which IL-29 influences immune responses and contributes to the development of severe disease. Additionally, exploring other factors that may regulate SOCS1 and LYST expression could provide a more comprehensive understanding of their roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Clinical outcomes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to the development of mild to severe respiratory illness, and in some instances, chronic lingering disease and mortality. The underlying biological mechanisms driving this wide spectrum of pathogenicity among certain individuals and demographics remain elusive. Autoantibodies have emerged as potential contributors to the severity of COVID-19. Although preliminary reports have suggested the induction of antibodies targeting Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) post-infection, this assertion lacks confirmation in large-scale studies. In this study, our objective is to comprehensively characterize and quantify the prevalence and expression levels of autoantibodies directed against ACE2 in a sizable cohort (n = 434). Our findings reveal that ACE2-reactive IgM antibodies are the most prevalent, with an overall seroprevalence of 18.8%, followed by IgG at 10.3% and IgA at 6.3%. Longitudinal analysis of individuals with multiple blood draws showed stable ACE2 IgG and IgA levels over time. Upon stratifying individuals based on molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 or serological evidence of past infection, no significant differences were observed between groups. Functional assessment of ACE2 autoantibodies demonstrated that they are non-neutralizing and failed to inhibit spike-ACE2 interaction or affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Our results highlight that ACE2 autoantibodies are prevalent in the general population and were not induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort. Notably, we found no substantiated evidence supporting a direct role for ACE2 autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.">

We crossed TIA1 cKO mice (using a CX3CR1 driven cre element) to PS19 MAPT P301S tauopathy mice. The peripheral macrophages of TIA1 cKO mice exhibited a hyper-inflammatory phenotype with increased cytokine signaling, as expected. Surprisingly, the brains of these mice showed striking reductions in inflammation, including decreases in microglial inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β) and sensome markers (CLEC7A, TREM2, ITGAX); these reductions were accompanied by corresponding decreases in tau pathology. Analysis of the brain TIA1 protein interactome identified brain selective TIA1 protein mediated pathways, including strong interactions with the microglial protein C1q, which directs pruning of dystrophic neurons. These results uncover a previously unknown regulatory role for TIA1 in microglial activation in the context of neurodegenerative disease and highlights the divergent regulation of two mononuclear phagocytic lineages: microglia and macrophages.">

        <tr id="Basal ganglia disease has been reported as a post-infection sequela of several viruses, with documentation of this phenomenon from the H1N1 Spanish flu to the recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

How formation of specifically long-lived plasma cells is regulated via the interplay between specific B and CD4+ T cells is not well understood. Generally, antibody levels decline over time after clearance of the primary infection.In this study, convalescent individuals with stable RBD antibody levels (n=14, “sustainers”) were compared with donors (n=13) with the greatest antibody decline from a cohort of 132. To investigate the role of the cellular immune compartment in the maintenance of antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific responses at 4 to 6 weeks post-mild COVID-19 infection were characterized using deep immune profiling.Both groups had similar frequencies of total SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+ T cells. Sustainers had fewer Spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells early after infection and increased neutralizing capacity of RBD antibodies over time, unlike the declining group. However, declining IgG titers correlated with lower frequency of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells.These data suggest that “sustainers” have unique dynamics of GC reactions, yield different outputs of terminally differentiating cells, and improve the quality of protective antibodies over time. This study helps identify factors controlling formation of long-lived PC and sustained antibody responses.">

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism.

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly impacted global health, emphasizing the need to understand its pathogenicity and virulence mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the alveolar epithelial barrier and exacerbates airway inflammation, leading to acute respiratory failure, but the molecular details remain unclear. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological symptoms, potentially due to its weakly understood ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The viral multifunctional Envelope (E) protein is crucial for its virulence, playing a key role in virus assembly, budding, and release. The E protein contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that interacts with host PDZ domain-containing proteins, potentially affecting host signaling pathways and contributing to pathogenicity. This study focuses on the E protein PBM and its role in virulence, disrupting respiratory epithelial barriers and exacerbating airway inflammation. We generated recombinant mutant viruses lacking the PBM and conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments to elucidate its impact on viral fitness, pathogenicity, and effects on the epithelial integrity. In vitro, the viral mutants showed delayed replication and reduced cytopathic effects. In vivo, experiments with hamsters revealed that PBM-deficient viruses caused less weight loss, lower viral loads, and reduced inflammation, indicating decreased pathogenicity. Histological analyses confirmed less airway damage in these hamsters compared to those infected with the wild-type virus. Additionally, PBM-deficient viruses had impaired interactions with tight junction proteins like ZO-1, a PDZ-containing protein, crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. Our findings also demonstrate that the PBM does not play a significant role in neuroinvasion during the acute phase of infection, as evidenced by comparable viral RNA loads across brain regions in infected hamsters, regardless of PBM presence. Histopathological and transcriptomic analyses further support this observation, suggesting that the PBM primarily affects specific epithelial barriers. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis on lung and brainstem from infected hamsters reveals that the PBM modulates inflammatory and immune responses, with a stronger impact in lung tissue than in the brainstem. PBM-deficient viruses induce lower levels of inflammation and cytokine expression, suggesting PBM’s specific role in enhancing viral pathogenicity through the activation of pathways such as NF-κB and TNF. Thus, the E protein PBM plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2’s fitness, virulence, and pathogenicity, through the disruption of cell junctions and inflammation, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a global health crisis, prompting extensive research into its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions. One area of increasing interest is the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the complement system, a crucial component of innate immunity. This review explores the intricate relationship between COVID-19 and the complement system, shedding light on how the virus exploits and manipulates the complement components to induce inflammatory responses leading to coagulopathies. The activation of the complement pathway simultaneously activates the coagulation cascade due to the presence of common substrates of mannan-binding serine proteases of the lectin complement system in the coagulation pathway. This cross-talk between the components of the complement and coagulation system further aggravates the dysregulation of immune responses, contributing to the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases. A comprehensive understanding of this crosstalk is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe disease. Understandings into the molecular mechanisms governing this interaction may pave the way for the development of novel antiviral diagnostics and therapies based on immunomodulatory interventions, offering better management for such cases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted global health, affecting not only the immediate morbidity and mortality rates but also long-term health outcomes across various populations. Although the acute effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system have initially been the primary focus, it is increasingly evident that the virus can have significant impacts on multiple physiological systems, including the nervous and immune systems. The pandemic has highlighted the complex interplay between viral infection, immune aging, and brain health, that can potentially accelerate neuroimmune aging and contribute to the persistence of long COVID conditions. By inducing chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and neuroinflammation, COVID-19 may exacerbate the processes of neuroimmune aging, leading to increased risks of cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases, and impaired immune function. Key factors include chronic immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the disruption of cellular processes. These overlapping mechanisms between aging and COVID-19 illustrate how the virus can induce and accelerate aging-related processes, leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and other age-related conditions. This mini-review examines key features and possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced neuroimmune aging that may contribute to the persistence and severity of long COVID. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective interventions. Anti-inflammatory therapies, neuroprotective agents, immunomodulatory treatments, and lifestyle interventions all hold potential for mitigating the long-term effects of the virus. By addressing these challenges, we can improve health outcomes and quality of life for millions affected by the pandemic.">

The development of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 has been hampered by the requirement of a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory for experiments related to SARS-CoV-2, and by the lack of easy and precise methods for quantification of infection. Here, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 viral vector composed of all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins constitutively expressed in lentivirally transduced cells, combined with an RNA replicon deleted for SARS-CoV-2 structural protein genes S, M and E, and expressing a luciferase-GFP fusion protein. We show that, after concentrating viral stocks by ultracentrifugation, the SARS-CoV-2 viral vector is able to infect two human cell lines expressing receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Both luciferase activity and GFP fluorescence were detected, and transduction was remdesivir-sensitive. We also show that this vector is inhibited by three type I interferons (IFN-I) subtypes. Although improvements are needed to increase infectious titers, this vector system may prove useful for antiviral drug screening and SARS-CoV-2-related investigations.">

 Introduction:
 The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has significantly impacted global health. SARS-CoV-2 features an RNA genome and four structural proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Despite the decline in severe COVID-19 cases, patients with hematological malignancies remain at a heightened risk for hospitalization. Hence, novel therapeutic strategies are essential for treating COVID-19 in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is vital for blood coagulation, bone health, antioxidative activities, and immune regulation. It exists primarily in two forms: VK1 (phylloquinone) and VK2 (menaquinone). VK2 is particularly significant for bone and cardiovascular health and may offer therapeutic benefits in this context.
 Materials and Method:
 The study investigated the potential of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to induce cell death in CML cells and examined if VK2 could inhibit this effect. Furthermore, it explored whether VK2 could enhance the efficacy of ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in treating CML cells, including those resistant to ABL TKI therapy.
 Results:
 Gene expression profiles from CML patients were analyzed using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, with focus on biological processes related to immune response and SARS-CoV-2 signaling pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the data from CML patients indicated that immune effector response and vascular development were significantly enriched biological processes (GSE100026). The SARS-CoV-2 signaling pathway (WP5115) played notable roles in these immune effector responses. In severe COVID-19 cases, there was a significant increase in the gene expression of IL-1a, IL-1b, and IL-6 compared to healthy controls (GSE227341). Due to the respiratory and immune-mediated effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, the CML cell line K562 was treated with an exogenous addition of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Treatment of K562 cells with the SARS-CoV-2 E protein led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, heightened cytotoxicity, and increased caspase 3/7 activity. Cell death in K562 cells began within two hours. The apoptotic cell count rose due to the SARS-CoV-2 E protein, while the S1 protein did not trigger similar effects, suggesting that the E protein primarily causes cytotoxicity in CML cells. VK2 treatment protected CML cells from the damage caused by the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Our results showed that VK2 significantly reduced the levels of IL-1a, IL-1b, and IL-6. Additionally, VK2 suppressed the growth of both K562 and ponatinib-resistant K562 (K562 PR) cells in a dose-responsive manner, enhanced cytotoxicity, and diminished colony formation. When used with imatinib, VK2 further inhibited cell proliferation, raised caspase 3/7 activity, and led to increased cytotoxicity in both K562 and K562 PR cells, and diminished colony formation. Co-treatment also resulted in a significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP), indicating impaired mitochondrial function and reduced cellular viability.
 Conclusion:
 The research shows that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein triggers cell death in CML cells, and VK2 effectively mitigates this harm. In addition, VK2 boosts the efficacy of imatinib against CML cells, even those resistant to ABL TKI therapy. These results indicate that VK2 may be a potential treatment option for CML patients, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it provides both protective and therapeutic advantages.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was linked to significant neurological and psychiatric manifestations. This review examines the physiopathological mechanisms underlying these neuropsychiatric outcomes and discusses current management strategies. Primarily a respiratory disease, COVID-19 frequently leads to neurological issues, including cephalalgia and migraines, loss of sensory perception, cerebrovascular accidents, and neurological impairment such as encephalopathy. Lasting neuropsychological effects have also been recorded in individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting a lasting impact on mental health. The neuroinvasive potential of the virus, inflammatory responses, and the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in neuroinflammation are critical factors in neuropsychiatric COVID-19 manifestations. In addition, the review highlights the importance of monitoring biomarkers to assess Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement. Management strategies for these neuropsychiatric conditions include supportive therapy, antiepileptic drugs, antithrombotic therapy, and psychotropic drugs, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Understanding the long-term neuropsychiatric implications of COVID-19 is essential for developing effective treatment protocols and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The persistence or emergence of long-term symptoms following resolution of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). PASC predominantly affects the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Among these, the central nervous system (CNS) is significantly impacted, leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, brain fog, cognitive impairment, anosmia, hypogeusia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and peripheral neuropathy (neuro-PASC). However, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms responsible for neuro-PASC remain unclear. This review hypothesis discusses the leading hypotheses regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in long COVID/PASC, focusing on neuro-PASC. We propose vascular dysfunction mediated by activation of astrocytes and pericytes followed by blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological manifestations. Additionally, we provide insights into the role of spike protein at the blood–brain interface. Finally, we explore the potential pathogenic mechanisms initiated by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors at the brain endothelial and tissue levels.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virus-infected cells have the potential to encapsulate viral peptides, a characteristic that could facilitate vaccine development. Furthermore, plasma-derived EVs may elucidate pathological changes occurring in distal tissues during viral infections. We hypothesized that molecular characterization of EVs isolated from COVID-19 patients would reveal peptides suitable for vaccine development. Blood samples were collected from three cohorts: severe COVID-19 patients (G1), mild/asymptomatic cases (G2), and SARS-CoV-2-negative healthcare workers (G3). Samples were obtained at two time points: during the initial phase of the pandemic in early 2020 (m0) and eight months later (m8). Clinical data analysis revealed elevated inflammatory markers in G1. Notably, non-vaccinated individuals in G1 exhibited increased levels of neutralizing antibodies at m8, suggesting prolonged exposure to viral antigens. Proteomic profiling of EVs was performed using three distinct methods: immunocapture (targeting CD9), ganglioside-capture (utilizing Siglec-1) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Contrary to our hypothesis, this analysis failed to identify viral peptides. These findings were subsequently validated through Western blot analysis targeting the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein’s and comparative studies using samples from experimentally infected Syrian hamsters. Furthermore, analysis of the EV cargo revealed a diverse molecular profile, including components involved in the regulation of viral replication, systemic inflammation, antigen presentation, and stress responses. These findings underscore the potential significance of EVs in the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes the extremely infectious sickness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Globally, COVID-19 (simply, COVID) has had a terrible impact, killing more than 6 million people. SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly around the globe since the first instance of this respiratory viral infection was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 31 December 2019. Keeping given epidemiological estimates, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Post-COVID is a clinical condition characterized by the development of totally new COVID-19 symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-affected patients have been reporting a range of cardiovascular (CV) abnormalities which include myocardial inflammation, myocardial infarction, right ventricular dysfunction, myocardial hypertrophy, coronary artery atherosclerosis, focal myocardial fibrosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, viral myocarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom (POTS), aortic and arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, and arrhythmias. Cardiopulmonary symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, hypotension, and POTS are common and associated with significant disability and heightened anxiety. Additionally, the risk of CV side effects has also been reported with currently available COVID-19 vaccines. Pathophysiological mechanisms for post-COVID cardiac complications are still poorly understood. COVID-19 is anticipated to alter the long-term trajectory of many chronic cardiac diseases which are abundant in those at risk of severe disease. This review discusses the definition of post-COVID complications, pathophysiological mechanisms of underlying acute and chronic CV injury, and their impact post-COVID-19 on multiorgan health.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease marked by the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and a lack of tolerance to nuclear self-antigens. Hypocomple-mentemia, or an abnormal blood complement deficit, is a reliable predictor of infection in SLE patients. Moreover, it has been found that immunoglobulin (Ig), particularly IgG and IgM, is lowered in SLE patients, which may be a factor in their heightened susceptibility to infection. Bloodstream autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, proinflammatory cytokines, and impaired regulatory systems all lead to an immune response that is aberrant in lupus patients. SLE patients exhibit impaired CD8 T cell responses, including abnormal phagocytosis and chemotaxis. Recent study has shown that COVID-19 infections significantly boost type I inter-feron responses. Patients with SLE and Covid-19 infection typically get immune-suppressing drugs viz corticosteroids, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK), and tocilizumab, which improve their immune systems and diminution susceptible to Covid-19 infections.">

        <tr id="Introduction Dysregulated host cytokine responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are a primary cause of progression to severe disease, whereas early neutralizing antibody responses are considered protective. However, there are gaps in understanding the early temporal dynamics of these immune responses, and the profile of productive immune responses generated by non-hospitalized people with mild infections in the community. Methods Here we conducted a prospective cohort study of people with suspected infections/exposures in the US state of North Carolina, before vaccine availability. We recruited participants not only in hospitals/clinics, but also in their homes. With serial sampling, we compared virologic and immunologic factors in 258 community cases versus 114 hospital cases of COVID-19 to define factors associated with severity. Results We found that high early neutralizing antibodies were associated with lower nasal viral load, but not protection from hospitalization. Cytokine responses were evaluated in 125 cases, with subsets at first versus second week of illness to assess for time-dependent trajectories. The hospital group demonstrated a higher magnitude of serum IL-6, IL-1R antagonist, IP-10, and MIG; prolonged upregulation of IL-17; and lesser downregulation of GROα, IL-1R antagonist, and MCP1, in comparison to the community group suggesting that these factors may contribute to immunopathology. In the second week of illness, 2-fold increases in IL-6, IL-1R antagonist, and IP-10 were associated with 2.2, 1.8, and 10-fold higher odds of hospitalization respectively, whereas a 2-fold increase in IL-10 was associated with 63% reduction in odds of hospitalization (p<0.05). Moreover, antibody responses at 3-6 months post mild SARS-CoV-2 infections in the community revealed long-lasting antiviral IgM and IgA antibodies as well as a stable set point of neutralizing antibodies that were not waning. Discussion Our data provide valuable temporal cytokine benchmarks to track the progression of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients and guide improvements in immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 (LC) is a poorly understood, multifactorial condition that persists for at least three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the wide range of associated symptoms—including fatigue, brain fog, and respiratory issues—remain unclear. However, emerging evidence suggests that the reactivation of latent viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella-zoster virus, may significantly contribute to the complexity of LC. These latent viruses can be reactivated by SARS-CoV-2, contributing to a chronic inflammatory state that prolongs symptomatology. This review confirms the potential involvement of latent viral infections in LC and examines whether these infections play an independent role or act synergistically with other factors. In addition, recent studies have highlighted viral persistence and immune dysregulation as key elements in LC. Our findings suggest that preventative strategies, including vaccination and antiviral treatments during the acute phase of COVID-19, show potential in reducing LC risk by preventing viral reactivation. However, tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting these latent infections are urgently needed. Identifying biomarkers of viral reactivation, particularly for high-risk populations, could be considered another effective strategy to mitigate LC severity. Further research is crucial to better understand the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and latent infections, and to improve the prevention and treatment of LC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and risk of long COVID has been associated with the depletion or over-abundance of specific taxa within the gut microbiome. However, the microbial mechanisms mediating these effects are not yet known. We hypothesized that altered microbial production of tryptophan and its downstream derivatives might contribute to inappropriate immune responses to viral infection. In patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 172), serum levels of tryptophan and indole-3-propionate (IPA) negatively correlated with serum levels of many proinflammatory mediators (including C-reactive protein and Serum amyloid A), while C-glycosyltryptophan (C-Trp), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were positively correlated with levels of acute phase proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, alarmins and chemokines. A similar pattern was observed in long COVID patients (n = 20) where tryptophan and IPA were negatively associated with a large number of serum cytokines, while C-Trp and IAA were positively associated with circulating cytokine levels. Metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota showed the relative abundance of genes encoding the microbial enzymes required for tryptophan production (e.g. anthranilate synthase) and microbial tryptophan metabolism was significantly lower in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 380) compared to healthy controls (n = 270). Microbial tryptophan metabolites reduced innate cell proinflammatory responses to cytosolic DNA sensor Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and TLR-4 stimulation in vitro, while IL-10 secretion was enhanced. Microbial tryptophan metabolites also modified ex vivo human lymphocyte responses by limiting the production of TH1 and TH17 associated cytokines, while enhancing secretion of IL-22. These data suggest that lower levels of tryptophan production and tryptophan metabolism by gut microbes may increase the risk of severe and chronic outcomes to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to impaired innate and adaptive responses to infection. Screening patients for lower-level microbiome capacity for tryptophan metabolism may help identify at-risk individuals.">

        <tr id="Regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a key homeostatic regulator of immune cells, has been implicated in multiple diseases associated with aging and chronic inflammation including Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Interestingly, subjects with idiopathic PD display reduced levels of RGS10 in subsets of peripheral immune cells. Additionally, individuals with PD have been shown to have increased activated peripheral immune cells in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) compared to age-matched healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether CSF-resident peripheral immune cells in individuals with PD also exhibit decreased levels of RGS10. Therefore, we performed an analysis of RGS10 levels in the proteomic database of the CSF from the Michael J. Fox Foundation Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study. We found that RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF of individuals with PD compared to healthy controls and prodromal individuals. Moreover, we find that RGS10 levels decrease with age but not PD progression and that males have less RGS10 than females in PD. Importantly, studies have established an association between chronic systemic inflammation (CSI) and neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, and known sources of CSI have been identified as risk factors for developing PD; however, the role of peripheral immune cell dysregulation in this process has been underexplored. As RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF and circulating peripheral immune cells of individuals with PD, we hypothesized that RGS10 regulates peripheral immune cell responses to CSI prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. To test this, we induced CSI for 6 weeks in C57BL6/J mice and RGS10 KO mice to assess circulating and CNS-associated peripheral immune cell responses. We found that RGS10 deficiency synergizes with CSI to induce a bias for inflammatory and cytotoxic cell populations, a reduction in antigen presentation in peripheral blood immune cells, as well as in and around the brain that is most notable in males. These results highlight RGS10 as an important regulator of the systemic immune response to CSI and implicate RGS10 as a potential contributor to the development of immune dysregulation in PD.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has exposed the vulnerabilities and unpreparedness of the global healthcare system in dealing with emerging zoonoses. In the past two decades, coronaviruses (CoV) have been responsible for three major viral outbreaks, and the likelihood of future outbreaks caused by these viruses is high and nearly inevitable. Therefore, effective prophylactic universal vaccines targeting multiple circulating and emerging coronavirus strains are warranted. Methods: This study utilized an immunoinformatic approach to identify evolutionarily conserved CD4+ (HTL) and CD8+ (CTL) T cells, and B-cell epitopes in the coronaviral spike (S) glycoprotein. Results: A total of 132 epitopes were identified, with the majority of them found to be conserved across the bat CoVs, pangolin CoVs, endemic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Their peptide sequences were then aligned and assembled to identify the overlapping regions. Eventually, two major peptide assemblies were derived based on their promising immune-stimulating properties. Conclusions: In this light, they can serve as lead candidates for universal coronavirus vaccine development, particularly in the search for pan-coronavirus multi-epitope universal vaccines that can confer protection against current and novel coronaviruses.">

Based on viral infectious diseases, innate immunity cells such as mast cells and basophils play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. Understanding these mechanisms could be essential to better study practical therapeutic approaches not only to COVID-19 but also to other viral infections widely spread worldwide, such as influenza A, HIV, and dengue. In this literature review, we want to study these concepts. Mast cells and basophils intervene as a bridge between innate and acquired immunity and seem to have a role in the damage mechanisms during infection and in the stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity. In some cases, these cells can act as reservoirs and favor the replication and spread of the virus in the body. Understanding these mechanisms can be useful not only in therapeutic but also in diagnostic and prognostic perspectives. The prospects of applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for the creation of very accurate diagnostic/prognostic tools are interesting.">

 The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has brought about numerous challenges. One of these challenges is the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver. Although this virus primarily affects the lungs, it can induce elevated transaminase levels and the development of scar tissue in the liver, exacerbating preexisting liver conditions. Individuals with preexisting conditions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), face an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. However, drugs currently used to treat COVID-19 have undesirable side effects that make them unsuitable for patients with pre-existing liver conditions. In this review, we explore the potential of phytochemicals, such as apigenin, berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, quercetin, resveratrol and silymarin, for treatment of the liver conditions NAFLD, ALD and HCC. We also discuss significant associations between phytochemicals and COVID-19 by depicting their molecular interactions. Based on the discussed overlapping functions, it is important to assess the therapeutic efficacy of phytochemicals that possess hepatoprotective properties as potential alternative COVID-19 treatments.">

        <tr id="Vascular injury and pathologies underlie common diseases including ischemic stroke and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Prior work has identified a key role for glial cells, including microglia, in the multifaceted and temporally evolving neuroimmune response to both stroke and CSVD. Transcriptional profiling has led to important advances including identification of distinct gene expression signatures in ischemia-exposed, flow cytometrically sorted microglia and more recently single cell RNA sequencing-identified microglial subpopulations or clusters. There is a reassuring degree of overlap in the results from these two distinct methodologies with both identifying a proliferative and a separate type I interferon responsive microglial element. Similar patterns were later seen using multimodal and spatial transcriptomal profiling in ischemia-exposed microglia and astrocytes. Methodological advances including enrichment of specific neuroanatomic/functional regions (such as the neurovascular unit) prior to single cell RNA sequencing has led to identification of novel cellular subtypes and generation of new credible hypotheses as to cellular function based on the enhanced cell sub-type specific gene expression patterns. A ribosomal tagging strategy focusing on the cellular translatome analyses carried out in the acute phases post stroke has revealed distinct inflammation-regulating roles for microglia and astrocytes in this setting. Early spatial transcriptomics experiments using cerebral ischemia models have identified regionally distinct microglial cell clusters in ischemic core versus penumbra. There is great potential for combination of these methods for multi-omics approaches to further elucidate glial responses in the context of both acute ischemic stroke and chronic CSVD.">

MIP-1β and IFN-γ were altered upon early LPS stimulation. In the periphery, we found MMP-9 was significantly increased in serum samples from 5xFAD mice. Interestingly, early LPS stimulation significantly elevated TNF-α in serum from WT and 5xFAD mice, but was reduced in the hippocampus due to Aβ pathology. The LPS treatment in 5xFAD mice had a tendency to improve the short-term memory deficit.

        <tr id="Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a significant global public health challenge. While respiratory symptoms dominate, the virus's impact on other systems, particularly the central nervous system (CNS), has gained increasing attention. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates tropism for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, expressed in the olfactory epithelium, lungs, endothelium, kidneys, enterocytes, and neurons, contributing to neurological manifestations observed during the acute phase of the disease.  
Materials and Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. Keywords included: COVID-19, Post Acute COVID-19 Syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 Virus, Neurological Manifestations, and Central Nervous System Viral Diseases. A total of 58 articles were selected for analysis based on relevance and quality of evidence regarding neurological symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19.  
Basic Results: The acute phase of COVID-19 frequently involves neurological symptoms such as frontal and holocranial headaches, dizziness, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions, and alterations in consciousness. Severe complications, though less common, include encephalitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and myelitis. These conditions often present as altered mental status, seizures, aphasia, headaches, or focal deficits, contributing substantially to patient morbidity and mortality.  
Conclusions: Neurological symptoms and complications constitute a significant aspect of COVID-19, highlighting the virus's potential to affect the CNS. While severe complications are rare, their profound impact on prognosis underscores the importance of early recognition and management. Further research is essential to understand the pathophysiology and optimise therapeutic approaches for affected patients. ">

Here, we take advantage of a detailed dataset from a human challenge study to fit dynamic models that include innate and adaptive immune responses to longitudinal changes in both infectious and total virus. We uncovered a nonlinear relationship between total virus and infectious virus. We found that viral replication, after a short delay, is rapid, with a doubling time of ~2 h for viral RNA and ~3 h for infectious virus. We also found that innate immunity wanes as virus is brought under control, which together with adaptive immunity, initiated ~7 to 10 d postinfection, contributes to a multiphasic viral decline experienced by some participants.">

        <tr id="Aberrant and sustained activation of microglia is implicated in the progression and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether intrinsic alterations in microglial function impact the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclear. We conducted transcriptomic and functional analyses of microglia-like cells (iMGLs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with MS (pwMS) to answer this question. We generated iPSCs from six pwMS showing increased microglial activity via translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging. We demonstrated that the differentiated iMGL transcriptional profile resembled the microglial signature found in MS lesions. Importantly, compared with healthy controls, MS iMGLs presented cell-autonomous differences in their regulation of inflammation, both in the basal state and following inflammatory lipopolysaccharide challenge. Through transcriptomic profiling, we showed that MS iMGLs display increased expression of genes known to be upregulated in MS microglia. Furthermore, upregulated genes in MS iMGLs were associated with immune receptor activation, antigen presentation, and the complement system, with known MS implications. Finally, functional analyses indicated that the transcriptional changes in MS iMGLs corresponded with alterations in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and increased phagocytosis. Together, our results provide evidence of putative cell-autonomous microglial activation in pwMS and identify transcriptomic and functional changes that recapitulate the phenotypes observed in vivo in microglia from pwMS. These findings indicate that MS disease-specific iPSCs are valuable tools for studying disease-specific microglial activation in vitro and highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets in MS.">

        <tr id="Introduction and Objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the nasal cavity, penetrates the nasal epithelial cells through the interaction of its spike protein with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then triggers a cytokine storm. We aimed to assess the biocompatibility of fullerenol nanoparticles C60(OH)40 and ectoine, and to document their effect on the protection of primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpCs) against the effects of interaction with the fragment of virus - spike protein. This preliminary research is the first step towards the construction of a intranasal medical device with a protective, mechanical function against SARS-CoV-2 similar to that of personal protective equipment (eg masks). Methods We used HNEpCs and the full-length spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 to mimic the first stage of virus infection. We assessed cell viability with the XTT assay and a spectrophotometer. May–Grünwald Giemsa and periodic acid–Schiff staining served to evaluate HNEpC morphology. We assessed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate and commercial kit. Finally, we employed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and confocal microscopy to determine the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and inflammatory cytokines. Results There was normal morphology and unchanged viability of HNEpCs after incubation with 10 mg/L C60(OH)40, 0.2% ectoine or their composite for 24 h. The spike protein exerted cytotoxicity via ROS production. Preincubation with the composite protected HNEpCs against the interaction between the spike protein and the host membrane and prevented the production of key cytokines characteristic of severe coronavirus disease 2019, including interleukin 6 and 8, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Conclusion In the future, the combination of fullerenol and ectoine may be used to prevent viral infections as an intranasal medical device for people with reduced immunity and damaged mucous membrane.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a significant threat to global public health. Immunopathological damage plays a role in driving pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure in severe COVID-19. Therefore, dissecting the pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to understand disease pathogenesis and identify immune pathways targetable by therapeutic intervention. Considering that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 enhances COVID-19 disease severity, therapeutic targeting of upstream signals that drive type 2 immunity may confer further protection. In this study, we investigate the role of the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis, a potent inducer of type 2 immunity in the lung, in a mouse model of COVID-19. Upon infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10, ST2-/- mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (69.2% vs 13.3% survival; P = 0.0005), as compared to wild-type mice. In a complementary pharmacologic approach, IL-33/ST2 signaling was inhibited using HpBARI_Hom2, a helminth derived protein that binds to mouse ST2 and blocks IL-33 signaling. In SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had significantly improved weight loss and survival (60% vs 10% survival; P = 0.0035), as compared to inert control-treated mice. These data demonstrate that loss of IL-33/ST2 signaling confers protection during acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection, implicating the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis as an enhancer of COVID-19 disease severity. The protection conferred by pharmacologic blockade of IL-33/ST2 signaling was independent of viral control, as HpBARI_Hom2-treated mice had no reduction in viral titers. This finding suggests an immunopathogenic role for IL-33/ST2 signaling. One potential mechanism through which IL-33/ST2 signaling may drive severe disease is through enhancement of type 2 immune pathways including IL-5 production, as pulmonary IL-5 concentrations were found to depend on IL-33/ST2 signaling in acute SARS-CoV-2 MA10 infection.">

 The sheer number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the development of a debilitating post-acute condition named post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as Long COVID. Symptoms of PASC can last for months to years after the initial infection and are multifaceted, including fatigue, exertional malaise, and a collection of cognitive impairments (e.g., brain fog). Conservative estimates suggest PASC occurs in ~10% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. PASC is associated with hypercoagulability and persistent endotheliopathy, and several studies reported increased risks for cardiovascular disease and thrombosis up to 1 year after infection. The mechanisms responsible for PASC remain unclear. Numerous hypotheses are proposed, including chronic inflammation due to persistent viral reservoirs, development of autoimmunity, and immune-mediated tissue damage resulting from continuing complement activation and/or non-resolving anti-viral responses. This indicates the urgent need for new models to test these hypotheses and to understand the pathogenesis of PASC and PASC-associated thrombosis.
 We developed a mouse model of Long-COVID based on the widely used K18-hACE2 (K18) transgenic mouse. Infection with a low viral dose of 2.5 x 103 f.f.u. of SARS-CoV-2 (USA WA1/2020) prolonged the acute symptomatic phase recapitulating many of the COVID-19-Associated Coagulopathy (CAC) findings observed in human patients, including hypercoagulability, increased plasma concentration of D-Dimers, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and VWF. Surviving mice recovered their initial body weight two weeks post-infection and did not display signs of overt disease for their remaining lifetime.
 Histological analysis of surviving mice revealed the presence of long-lasting inflammatory foci scattered around the lungs' parenchyma, persisting up to 14 months post-infection, suggesting the existence of an enduring inflammatory stimulus of unknown origin leading to a state of chronic inflammation. Persistent endotheliopathy was evident from elevated levels of circulating sTM, sEPCR, sP-Selectin, and elevated levels of VWF in plasma lasting for at least 5 months post-infection.
 At 70 days post-infection K18 survivors developed significantly larger thrombi 24 hours after stenosis of the vena cava compared to infected wild-type (WT) littermate controls who developed minimal disease during the acute infection. The average thrombus size in K18 survivors was in between that of uninfected factor V Leiden heterozygous and homozygous mice, suggesting the thrombotic risk of K18 survivors might be somewhere in between as well. At 5 months post-infection, K18 survivors showed a complete and sustained occlusion in a carotid artery thrombosis model induced by a low dose of ferric chloride, whereas no stable occlusion was observed in infected WT littermate controls, suggesting a persistently increased susceptibility for thrombosis.
 To evaluate the occurrence of cognitive abnormalities comparable to those described in individuals with PASC, K18 survivors and infected WT littermate controls were challenged using a battery of behavioral tests 5 months post-infection. In an open field test, K18 survivors showed reduced exploratory drive and total distance traveled compared to controls, suggesting impaired locomotive activity and increased anxiety. Cognitive impairments of K18 survivors were exacerbated after physical or emotional stress. In a novel object recognition test preceded by 20 minutes treadmill running, K18 survivors spent significantly less time exploring the newly introduced object compared to infected WT littermate controls. Similarly, in a light/dark transfer test, a 30 minutes physical restraint, eliciting a corticosterone-mediated stress response, significantly reduced transitions from darkness to light in K18 survivors when compared to infected WT littermate controls. Thus, K18 survivors displayed a significant increase in stress and anxiety responses that are indicative of cognitive impairments that were not observed in infected WT littermate controls.
 In summary, our Long COVID mouse model replicates key aspects of PASC in humans and provides a unique opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms contributing to PASC and to evaluate potential new therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Understanding how RNA viral load changes (viral load kinetics) during acute infection in SARS-CoV-2 can help to identify when and which patients are most infectious. We seek to summarise existing data on the longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 sampled from different parts of the respiratory tract (nose, nasopharynx, oropharynx, saliva and exhaled breath) and how this may vary with age, sex, ethnicity, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment and virus variant. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis, using studies identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE (via Ovid). All research studies reporting primary data on longitudinal RNA viral load kinetics of infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 will be included. Methodological quality will be assessed using a validated checklist for longitudinal studies as well as predefined quality criteria for assessment of individual-level RNA viral load. Should the data allow, we will aim to perform individual patient-level meta-analysis. Our primary outcomes are duration to, and quantity of peak RNA viral load, and total duration of viral load shedding within different respiratory compartments. Secondary outcomes include duration of lateral flow antigen and virus culture positivity and variation of RNA viral load by age, immune status, disease severity, vaccination, treatment, lateral flow tests, viral culture positivity and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Study-level effects affecting observations, but not related to properties of the patient, such as the PCR platform and gene target will also be recorded. Random-effects models will estimate the population mean and individual-level variation in viral shedding conditional on the aforementioned variables. Finally, we will summarise the key mechanistic models used in the literature to reconstruct individual-level viral kinetics and estimate how different factors shape viral dynamics over time. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not needed as data will be obtained from published articles or studies with data that have already received and ethical review for analysis.

        <tr id=". Literature data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection in people with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RD) are contradictory. According to most studies, the risk of infection and development of severe forms of COVID-19 is higher in patients with RD compared to the general population, but largely depends on the type and activity of RD. Patients with severe RD most often required mechanical ventilation and died more often. This is due to immune dysfunction caused by both the disease itself and antirheumatic therapy using immunomodulatory drugs. The state of immunosuppression, additional comorbid chronic diseases and incomplete vaccination are factors in the need for hospitalization, intensive care, the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and reinfection with coronavirus in patients with RD. They retained their significance during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Although there is no complete consensus in the literature regarding the association between the presence of rheumatic diseases and the severity of COVID-19, in general, rheumatic diseases are not considered to be a factor that increases the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the antibody response and reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19. However, people with rheumatic diseases have reduced or absent antibody production in response to even full vaccination and higher rates of breakthrough infection after vaccination. Further research on specific rheumatic diseases and the use of antirheumatic drugs in the context of COVID-19 is needed to reduce the severity of COVID-19 in this population.">

        <tr id="The global spread of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 has posed unique challenges to public health. This review was carried out from the perspective of immunological and pathological changes affecting epidemiological features of the disease during progression and therapy. COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system but may also affect cardiovascular and neurological systems, manifesting various symptoms from fever and cough to such severe complications as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and organ failure. Patterns in immune responses involving decreases in peripheral T cells and natural killer cells have been recognized as being part of a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Finally, it discusses the dynamic of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including droplet mode spread and possible fecal-oral pathway. The virus's structural and pathological attributes are emphasized, complemented by a historical overview that chronicles its transformation from a non-threatening variant to a worldwide hazard. Various management approaches, encompassing traditional Indian medicinal practices and immune-enhancing measures such as zinc, iron, magnesium, vitamins, and herbal treatments, are assessed regarding their effectiveness in bolstering immunity and facilitating recovery. Additionally, lifestyle habits such as physical activity, sufficient rest, and proper hydration contribute to the maintenance of immune health.

        <tr id="Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 and long-term complications in bone health. Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces bone turnover and promotes bone loss, but the mechanism underlying worsened bone health remains elusive. This study sought to identify specific immune mediators that exacerbated preexisting IMIDs after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Plasma samples from 4 groups were analyzed: healthy, IMID only, COVID-19 only, and COVID-19 + IMID. Using high-throughput multiplexed proteomics, we profiled 1,500 protein biomarkers and identified 148 unique biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with IMIDs, including elevated inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17F) and bone resorption markers. Long-term circulating SARS-CoV-2 ORF8, a virulence factor for COVID-19, was detected in the COVID + IMID group. RA was one of the most common IMIDs in our study. ORF8 treatment of RA-derived human osteoblasts (RA-hOBs) increased levels of inflammatory (TNF, IL6, CCL2) and bone resorption (RANKL/osteoprotegerin ratio) markers compared with healthy controls. Supernatants from ORF8-treated RA-hOBs drove the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exposure can exacerbate IMIDs through ORF8-driven inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19–induced bone pathologies.">

        <tr id="Concerns about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (COVID-19) continue to persist even years later, with the emergence of new variants and the risk of disease severity. Common clinical symptoms, like cough, fever, and respiratory symptoms, characterize the noncritical patients, classifying them from mild to moderate. In a more severe and complex scenario, the virus infection can affect vital organs, resulting, for instance, in pneumonia and impaired kidney and heart function. However, it is well-known that subclinical symptoms at a metabolic level can be observed previously but require a proper diagnosis because viral replication on the host leaves a track with a different profile depending on the severity of the illness. Metabolomic profiles of mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 patients were obtained by multiple platforms (LC-HRMS and MALDI-MS), increasing the chance to elucidate a prognosis for severity risk. A strong link was discovered between phenylalanine metabolism and increased COVID-19 severity symptoms, a pathway linked to cardiac and neurological consequences. Glycerophospholipids and sphingolipid metabolisms were also dysregulated linearly with the increasing symptom severity, which can be related to virus proliferation, immune system avoidance, and apoptosis escaping. Our data, endorsed by other literature, strengthens the notion that these pathways might play a vital role in a patient’s prognosis.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant attention to the respiratory system, with much focus on lung-related disorders. However, the diaphragm, a crucial component of respiratory physiology, has not been adequately studied, especially in the context of long COVID. This review explores the multipotential role of the diaphragm in both respiratory health and disease, emphasizing its involvement in long-term complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diaphragm’s fundamental role in respiratory physiology and its impact on balance and posture control, breathing patterns, and autonomic nervous system regulation are discussed. This review examines complications arising from COVID-19, highlighting the diaphragm’s involvement in neurological, musculoskeletal, and inflammatory responses. Particular attention is given to the neuroinvasive impact of SARS-CoV-2, the inflammatory response, and the direct viral effects on the diaphragm. The diaphragm’s role in long COVID is explored, with a focus on specific symptoms such as voice disorders, pelvic floor dysfunction, and sleep disturbances. Diagnostic challenges, current methods for assessing diaphragmatic dysfunction, and the complexities of differentiating it from other conditions are also explored. This article is the first to comprehensively address diaphragmatic dysfunction resulting from COVID-19 and long COVID across various physiological and pathological aspects, offering a new perspective on its diagnosis and treatment within a multisystem context.">

        <tr id="The clearance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) remains a significant public health challenge due to impaired cellular immune responses and HIV-1 maintenance during acute infection. However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) during early infection (<6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signalling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harbouring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.">

        <tr id="Advanced age increases the risk of severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as incidence of long COVID and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. We hypothesized that perturbations in the aged antiviral CD8+ T cell response predisposes elderly individuals to severe coronavirus infection, re-infection, and postinfectious cognitive sequelae. Using MHV-A59 as a murine model of respiratory coronavirus, we found that aging increased CNS infection and lethality to MHV infection. This was coupled with increased CD8+ T cells within the aged CNS but reduced antigen specificity. Aged animals also displayed a decreased proportion of CD103+ resident memory cells (TRM), which correlated with increased severity of secondary viral challenge. Using a reciprocal adoptive transfer paradigm, data show that not only were fewer aged CD8+ T cells retained within the adult brain post-infection, but also that adult CD8+ cells expressed lower levels of TRM marker CD103 when in the aged microenvironment. Furthermore, aged animals demonstrated spatial learning impairment following MHV infection, which worsened in both aged and adult animals following secondary viral challenge. Spatial learning impairment was accompanied by increased TUNEL positivity in hippocampal neurons, suggestive of neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, primary cell coculture showed that activated CD8+ T cells induced TUNEL positivity in neurons, independent of antigen-specificity. Altogether, these results show that non-antigen specific CD8+ T cells are recruited to the aged brain and cause broad neuronal death without establishing a TRM phenotype that confers lasting protection against a secondary infection.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 causes a global pandemic, with severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients often experiencing poor prognoses. Severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation. Detecting markers of macromolecular damage caused by OS may provide valuable insights into disease progression. Methods: This study included 187 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, categorized into non-severe, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 groups. We monitored the changes in serum indexes such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL), OxLDL/LDL-C ratio, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in patients with different clinical types. Results: 48 non-severe patients, 90 severe patients, and 49 critically ill patients were enrolled. Compared with the non-severe group, OxLDL level and OxLDL/LDL-C ratio were increased in severe COVID-19 patients and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while 3-NT and TXB2 concentrations were lower in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Critically ill COVID-19 patients also exhibited lower concentrations of Lp-PLA2 and a higher OxLDL/LDL-C ratio compared to severe COVID-19 patients. No significant differences were observed in AOPP and 8-OHdG concentrations. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that CRP was associated with OxLDL, OxLDL/LDL-C ratio, AOPP, 3-NT, TXB2, and Lp-PLA2 (P <0.05). OxLDL was identified as an independent risk factor for progression from non-severe to severe/critically ill COVID-19. OxLDL and OxLDL/LDL-C ratio demonstrated good discriminatory value between non-severe and severe/critically ill COVID-19, with the OxLDL/LDL-C ratio also distinguishing between severe and critically ill patients. Conclusion: Patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19 exhibit elevated levels of oxidative damage to lipoproteins. OxLDL and the OxLDL/LDL-C ratio can serve as biomarkers for assessing disease severity in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Although the risk of emerging coronavirus infection may seem to have disappeared at first glance, SARS-COV-2 has complex and poorly understood effects on many organ systems, including the nervous system. Disease progression and unfavorable outcome COVID-19 are not only due to lung damage, elderly age, concomitant pathology: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, etc. have a significant impact.Aim. To study the structure of mortality in a new coronavirus infection COVID-19, caused by delta strain of coronavirus SARS- CoV-2, taking into account the nature of concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, the degree of comorbidity, fatal complications, and sex and age characteristics.Materials and methods. A postmortem analysis of pathological and anatomical conclusions of 209 patients with COVID-19 with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology who received inpatient treatment in covid hospitals of the Republic of Mordovia in 2021 was performed. The severity of the underlying disease, concomitant therapeutic and neurological pathology, and comorbidity were analysed. The coincidence of the final clinical and pathological diagnoses, fatal complications were assessed. The presented data allowed to identify the main factors of unfavourable outcome.Results and discussion. In unfavourable outcome of the disease, concomitant pathology is represented by hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, chronic cerebral ischemia. In women, cases of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis were more frequent, in men - hypertension and chronic heart failure.Conclusions. New coronavirus COVID-19 infection associated with delta strain of SARS-COV-2 virus is characterised by severe and extremely severe course in elderly patients with comorbid somatic and neurological pathology.">

        <tr id="Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, represents a significant and complex health challenge with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the emerging evidence suggesting a critical role of the gut and gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of Long COVID. It explores how changes in the gut microbiome, disruption of gut barrier integrity, and the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens within the gastrointestinal tract may contribute to the prolonged and varied symptoms seen in Long COVID, including chronic inflammation and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The review also summarizes key insights gained about Long COVID, highlighting its multifactorial nature, which involves immune dysregulation, microvascular damage, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, with the gut playing a central role in these processes. While progress has been made in understanding these mechanisms, current evidence remains inconclusive. The challenges of establishing causality, standardizing research methodologies, and addressing individual variations in the microbiome are discussed, emphasizing the need for further longitudinal studies and more comprehensive approaches to enhance our understanding of these complex interactions. This review underscores the importance of personalized approaches in developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Long COVID, while also acknowledging the significant gaps in our current understanding. Future research should aim to further unravel the complex interplay between the gut and Long COVID, ultimately improving outcomes for those affected by this condition.">

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the population unequally, with a greater impact on older and immunosuppressed people. Methods Hence, we performed a prospective experimental cohort study to characterise the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in immune-compromised patients (older adults and oncohaematologic patients), compared with healthy counterparts, based on deep characterisation of the circulating immune cell subsets. Results and discussion While acquired humoral and cellular memory did not predict subsequent infection 18 months after full vaccination, spectral and computational cytometry revealed several subsets within the CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and TEMRA Tγδ cells that were differentially expressed in individuals who were subsequently infected and not infected not just following immunisation, but also prior to vaccination. Of note, we found up to seven clusters within the TEMRA Tγδ cell population, with some of them being expanded and others decreased in subsequently infected individuals. Moreover, some of these cellular clusters were also related to COVID-19-induced hospitalisation in oncohaematologic patients. Therefore, we have identified a cellular signature that even before vaccination is related to COVID-19 vulnerability as opposed to the acquisition of cellular and/or humoral memory following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.">

        <tr id="Sex differences have been observed in acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Long Covid (LC) outcomes, with greater disease severity and mortality during acute infection in males and greater proportions of females developing LC. We hypothesized that sex-specific immune dysregulation contributes to LC pathogenesis. To investigate the immunologic underpinnings of LC development and symptom persistence, we performed multiomic analyses on blood samples obtained during acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 3 and 12 months after infection in a cohort of 45 participants who either developed LC or recovered. Several sex-specific immune pathways were associated with LC. Males who would later develop LC exhibited increases in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling during acute infection, whereas females who would go on to develop LC had reduced TGFB1 expression. Females who developed LC demonstrated increased expression of XIST, an RNA gene implicated in autoimmunity, during acute infection compared with females who recovered. Many immune features of LC were also conserved across sexes, such as alterations in monocyte phenotype and activation state. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors were up-regulated in many cell types at acute and convalescent time points. Those with ongoing LC demonstrated reduced ETS1 expression across lymphocyte subsets and elevated intracellular IL-4 in T cell subsets, suggesting that ETS1 alterations may drive aberrantly elevated T helper cell 2-like responses in LC. Altogether, this study describes multiple innate and adaptive immune correlates of LC, some of which differ by sex, and offers insights toward the pursuit of tailored therapeutics.">

        <tr id="In this study we tested the hypothesis that the immunosenescence profile could account for the disproportional susceptibility of the elderly to severe forms of COVID-19. The immunological profiles of volunteers residing in endemic and non-endemic areas for chronic infectious diseases were analyzed at early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A unique signature of inflammatory plasma mediators was identified in COVID-19 volunteers when compared to individuals with other flu-like syndromes. COVID-19 severity correlated with high levels of inflammatory mediators; among them, CXCL9, a serum marker of aging. Patients who progressed to hospitalization displayed high frequencies of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing exhaustion and senescence markers and showed reduced and more mature B cell repertoires, which are typical of senescence. They also had an acceleration of epigenetic age measured by DNA methylation. Therefore, severe COVID-19 correlated with phenotypic, functional, and epigenetic features of accelerated immunosenescence at onset of infection.">

        <tr id="The pathogenesis of long COVID (LC) still presents many areas of uncertainty. This leads to difficulties in finding an effective specific therapy. We hypothesize that the key to LC pathogenesis lies in the presence of chronic functional damage to the main anti-inflammatory mechanisms of our body: the three reflexes mediated by the vagus nerve, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis, and the mitochondrial redox status. We will illustrate that this neuro-endocrine-metabolic axis is closely interconnected and how the SARS-CoV-2 can damage it at all stages through direct, immune-inflammatory, epigenetic damage mechanisms, as well as through the reactivation of neurotropic viruses. According to our theory, the direct mitochondrial damage carried out by the virus, which replicates within these organelles, and the cellular oxidative imbalance, cannot be countered in patients who develop LC. This is because their anti-inflammatory mechanisms are inconsistent due to reduced vagal tone and direct damage to the endocrine glands of the HPA axis. We will illustrate how acetylcholine (ACh) and cortisol, with its cytoplasmatic and cellular receptors respectively, are fundamental players in the LC process. Both Ach and cortisol play multifaceted and synergistic roles in reducing inflammation. They achieve this by modulating the activity of innate and cell-mediated immunity, attenuating endothelial and platelet activation, and modulating mitochondrial function, which is crucial for cellular energy production and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In our opinion, it is essential to study the sensitivity of the glucocorticoids receptor in people who develop LC and whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause long-term epigenetic variations in its expression and function.">

        <tr id="Microglia are non-electrogenic immune cells that respond rapidly to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from infections, injuries, or other forms of damage. Microglia mitochondria are essential for providing the requisite energy resources for immune regulation. While fluctuations in energy metabolism are regulated by mitochondria and are reflected in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), there remains a lack of innovation in microglia-centric tools that capitalize on this. In this study, live imaging of microglia in acute slices from EGFP reporter mice expressing EGFP under the control of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) promoter is combined with loading a fluorescent reporter of ΔΨm. Depolarizations in the ΔΨm were recorded after administering the well-characterized immune stimulant lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microglia ΔΨm increased in distinctive phases with a relatively steep slope following LPS exposure. Conversely, the ΔΨm of neurons showed minimal regulation, highlighting a distinct microglia ΔΨm response to immune stimuli. Analysis of the depolarization of the microglia ΔΨm in the soma, branches, and endfeet revealed progressive changes in each subcellular domain originating in the soma and progressing outward. The inverse agonist emapunil attenuated the depolarization of the ΔΨm across states in a domain-specific manner. These findings emphasize the contribution of mitochondrial membrane dynamics in regulating microglial responses to immune stimuli. Further, this work advances a novel drug screening strategy for the therapeutic regulation of metabolic activity in inflammatory conditions of the brain.">

In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this disease has enhanced our comprehension of viral infections, inflammatory reactions, and cardiovascular repercussions. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the occurrence of cardiac damage, arrhythmias, and thrombotic events that are associated to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby making the understanding of their development more complex. This research explores the complex correlation between Kounis syndrome and COVID-19, encompassing the phenomena of cytokine storms and endothelial dysfunction. Diagnosing Kounis syndrome in the context of COVID-19 presents challenges, nevertheless, it is imperative to distinguish it from other cardiovascular disorders. The identification of risk factors and predisposing situations that can exacerbate Kounis syndrome in COVID-19 patients is highlighted, with a particular focus on patient assessment. The care of Kounis syndrome in COVID-19 necessitates a multidisciplinary strategy that involves collaboration among cardiologists, allergists, and other specialists. Possible therapies encompass epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, cardiovascular interventions, as well as long-term surveillance and measures to reduce risk. Additional investigation should include epidemiological enquiries, experimental frameworks, and advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Comprehending the connection between viral infections and coronary syndromes caused by allergies is crucial for clinical practice and the well-being of patients.

The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has raised questions as to the similarities and differences between COVID-19 lung injury and ALI of other etiologies. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of ALI and COVID-19 lung injury and draws comparisons between the latter and other infectious etiologies of ALI. Indeed, severe COVID-19 is characterized by a unique array of disease mechanisms including suppression of interferon responses, widespread inflammasome activation, altered leukocyte phenotypes, and hyperactive thrombotic activity. Moreover, these mechanisms manifest as a unique clinical progression, which further differentiates COVID-19 from other viral respiratory pathogens such as SARS, MERS, and influenza. These unique features of COVID-19 pathophysiology bear important implications for current and future therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and has been related to more than 7 million deaths globally since 2019. The association of high levels of IL‐6 with severe cases led to the early evaluation of the anti‐IL6 inhibitor tocilizumab as a potential treatment, which unfortunately failed to improve survival in many trials. Moreover, little is known about the development of COVID‐19 sequelae, and biomarkers are needed to understand and anticipate these processes. Because extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in viral infection and immune response, they could potentially serve as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. We isolated EVs from 39 patients with severe COVID‐19, from which 29 received tocilizumab and 10 were considered controls. Blood samples, which were collected at hospitalisation before treatment, at Day 7, and Day 15 during follow‐up, were assessed by immunoblot for longitudinal expression of spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Dynamic expression was calculated and compared with clinicopathological and experimental variables. Expression of EV S was validated by immunogold and imaging flow‐cytometry, revealing an enrichment in CD9+ EVs. As a result, decreasing expression of EV viral proteins was observed in patients treated with tocilizumab. Moreover, higher increase in EV S was observed in patients with lower antibody response, hyperfibrinogenemia, lower respiratory function, higher blood pressure and shorter outcomes. These findings lay the foundation for future studies characterizing the role of EVs in multiorgan assessment and identifying biomarkers in patients with severe COVID‐19 and possible long COVID.">

        <tr id="Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection can result in either productive or latent infection, the latter being the basis for the virus life-long persistence. Intriguingly, monocytes, which support latent infection, become permissive to productive infection upon differentiation to macrophages. However, the molecular factors explaining these differentiation-driven differences are not fully understood and have been so far attributed to chromatin-mediated repression of the viral genome. Here, by using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA early in monocyte and macrophage infection, we discover a major early block in viral gene expression, and viral transcripts are barely detected in infected monocytes. By unbiasedly analyzing the changes between monocytes and their differentiated counterparts, we reveal that the levels of several cell surface proteins involved in HCMV entry are upregulated upon monocyte to macrophage differentiation, and correspondingly we uncover HCMV entry into monocytes compared to macrophages is extremely inefficient. Remarkably, ectopic expression of a canonical HCMV entry receptor in monocytes facilitates productive infection of these cells, demonstrating that given efficient viral entry, monocytes, like macrophages, have the capacity to support productive infection. Among the cell surface proteins that are upregulated upon monocyte differentiation are several integrins, which we show play an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially explaining the differences in viral entry. Overall, our findings reveal that a previously unrecognized major barrier for productive infection in monocytes is entry, adding a critical layer to the paradigm of HCMV latency.">

 Background.
 Post-COVID syndrome is related to a multisystem disorder that affects in part the cardiovascular system. This disease involves symptoms, and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection of immune and endothelial cells are associated with NETosis, microthrombosis and endothelial dysfunction that could persist several weeks after acute phase of infection. Damaged endothelial cells can expose the vessel pro-coagulant area leading to platelet and neutrophil clumps. Increased levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been described as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we hypothesize that CECs and microthrombosis are potential biomarkers of vascular dysfunction in Long COVID.


 Methods.
 A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Miami VA long COVID clinic. Long COVID cases and controls were recruited according to WHO definition for long COVID. A total of 23 patients and 7 controls were included in this study. Blood samples were collected in Heparin and Sodium Citrate tubes. Cell immunophenotyping and NETosis markers (MPO) were quantified on a Cytek Aurora spectral flow cytometer system. Microclots (CD62P
 +
 PAC-1
 +
 ) and platelet response were assessed by flow cytometry and response to Adenosine di-phosphate (ADP), respectively. A ttest was used for statistical analysis. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.


 Results.
 The age and gender were similar between cases and controls while their symptom score was significantly different. There was a significant increase in the number of CECs (CD31+CD309+CD45-CD133-) in Long COVID cases. MPO expression in neutrophils (CD11b
 +
 CD66b
 +
 CD15
 +
 ) and classical monocytes (CD14
 +
 CD16
 -
 ) was significantly higher in Long COVID. Microclots were significantly elevated, and the platelet aggregation response was dysregulated in Long COVID.


 Conclusions.
 CECs and microthrombosis including NETosis are present in Long COVID and may serve as potential biomarkers or causative mechanisms for vascular dysfunction.

        <tr id="The initial efforts to describe the inflammatory mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 have revealed upregulation of circulating proinflammatory cytokines as well as activation of innate immune cells.The aim of the study was to investigate the phagocytic activity of leukocytes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019).Methods. The phagocytic activity of leukocytes was studied in admitted patients with COVID-associated lung disease (n = 105). The mean age of the studied patients was 43.5 (37; 51) years; 69 for men, and 36 for women; the mean duration of the disease before hospitalization was 6 (4; 8) days. Using cluster analysis, two groups of patients (clusters) were formed according to the severity of COVID-19: Group 1 with the moderate course (n = 34) and Group 2 with the mild course (n = 71). Flow cytofluorimetry with determination of neutrophil (NI) and monocyte index (MI) was used to determine the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes in the peripheral blood.Results. The median NI in the studied patients was 97.9% (96.3; 99); the mean median MI was 91.2% (84.6; 95). The correlation analysis revealed statistically significant direct correlation of MI with SpO2 level (r = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.005 – 0.39; p = 0.04); inverse correlation of MI with CRP level (r = –0.31; 95% CI: –0.11 to –0.48; p = 0.003) and degree of lung damage by CT (r = –0.2; 95% CI: –0.11 to –0.48); p = 0.05). MI in the group with moderate course was statistically significantly lower than in the group with mild course of COVID-19 (86.7 (81.4; 91.7) and 92.6 (86.5; 95.4), p = 0.01). The blood MI of the initially more severe patients statistically significantly increased.Conclusion. Complicated forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection lead to a decrease in phagocytic activity of the monocytic-macrophage link of innate immunity. The degree of decrease in monocyte phagocytic activity is directly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the MI is comparable in the patients with severe and mild course after 30 days of treatment.">

Cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of mortality following infection. In this review, we discuss immune pathogenesis and four medications, including Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone, and Annual SZ for COVID-19. A comparison of the effectiveness and therapeutic usage of drugs as reported in clinical trials and reports was made at different disease levels as well. Clinical studies indicate that Annual SZ with mild side effects was more affordable and might be more effective than other medications.

        <tr id="Background: HIV-1 infection, even with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), is associated with chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, contributing to long-term health complications. Nicotine use, prevalent among people with HIV (PWH), is known to exacerbate immune activation and disease progression, but the precise biological mechanisms remain to be fully understood. This study sought to uncover the synergistic effects of HIV-1 infection and nicotine on immune cell function, focusing on beneficial insights into NLRP3 inflammasome activation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial pathways. Methods: Human tonsil explants were infected with HIV-1 and exposed to nicotine. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to profile immune cell populations and gene expression linked to inflammasome activation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and synergy assessments were conducted to investigate how nicotine modulates immune responses in the context of HIV. Results: The combination of HIV infection and nicotine exposure significantly increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thioredoxin, and components of oxidative phosphorylation. Conclusions: This study highlights how the combined effects of HIV-1 and nicotine offer valuable insights into immune modulation, opening doors for future therapeutic strategies. Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and addressing nicotine use may contribute to improved outcomes for PWH.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: COVID-19 is characterised by a wide variety of clinical manifestations, and clinical tests and genetic analysis might help to predict patient outcomes. Methods: In the current study, the expression of genes related to immune response (CCL5, IFI6, OAS1, IRF9, IL1B, and TGFB1) was analysed in the upper airway and paired-blood samples from 25 subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2. Relative gene expression was determined by RT-qPCR. Results: CCL5 expression was higher in the blood than in the upper airway (p < 0.001). In addition, a negative correlation was found between IFI6 and viral load (p = 0.033) in the upper airway, suggesting that the IFI6 expression inhibits the viral infection. Concerning sex, women expressed IL1B and IRF9 in a higher proportion than men at a systemic level (p = 0.008 and p = 0.049, respectively). However, an increased expression of IRF9 was found in men compared to women in the upper airway (p = 0.046), which could be due to the protective effect of IRF9, especially in men. Conclusions: The higher expression of CCL5 in blood might be due to the key role of this gene in the migration and recruitment of immune cells from the systemic circulation to the lungs. Our findings confirm the existence of sex differences in the immune response to early stages of the infection. Further studies in a larger cohort are necessary to corroborate the current findings.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic now had a broad impact on the health care system since its start. Cancer patients, specifically lung cancer patients, are undergoing a more vulnerable group due to their complex pathophysiological and immunological characteristics. Therefore, they need more attention and care about health and treatment. It is yet unknown how SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected lung cancer patient's health and management of treatment impacts them. From a clinical and multidisciplinary perspective, we aimed to explain our main priorities concerning COVID-19 infection in the scenario of lung cancer patients’ group in this chapter. Various types of lung cancer therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, can all significantly increase the risk, therefore making a patient's chances of a poor outcome higher. Patients with lung cancer need regular clinical and radiologic examinations and follow-ups, which the COVID-19 pandemic might hamper. COVID-19-related lung cancer patients’ incidental radiologic abnormalities might show up in regular radiology exams, making it challenging to understand disease progression and the effect of therapy. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted lung cancer care, highlighting challenges in patient management, treatment outcomes, and ethical dilemmas. Quantitative analysis and exploration of future directions would enhance clinical and research impact. In addition, cancer treatment-induced pneumonitis can exhibit radiologic characteristics that are identical to those seen in acute SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, possibly due to a wrong diagnosis and misinterpretation. The current COVID-19 health crisis is affecting many healthcare requirements, including the necessity for regular healthcare accessibility, particularly follow-ups, and the clinical trials in which this patient group may be included. The COVID-19 epidemic has placed healthcare practitioners, scientists, researchers, and institutions in a complex and dangerous situation, forcing them to address challenges with ethical scenarios.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections are ubiquitous in humans, with individuals harboring multiple latent viruses that can reactivate during acute illnesses. Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence (≥3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue. Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.">

        <tr id="Post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) syndrome represents a cluster of persistent symptoms following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that can severely affect quality of life. The pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiology in different regions are still under evaluation. To assess the outcomes of post-COVID-19 syndrome, we performed a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study in previously infected individuals. Out of 549 respondents, (male:female ratio: 0.32), 29.5% had persistent symptoms at 3 months, 23.5% had persistent symptoms at 6 months, and 18.3% had persistent symptoms at 12 months after the initial infection. The most common symptoms included fatigue (8.7%), sleep disturbances (7.1%), and cognitive impairment (6.4%). The risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome increased for those with more symptoms in the acute phase (OR 4.24, p < 0.001) and those experiencing reinfections (OR 2.405, p < 0.001), while SARS-CoV-2 vaccination halved the risk (OR = 0.489, p = 0.004). Individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome had a 5.7-fold higher risk of being diagnosed with a new chronic condition, with 44% reporting cardiovascular disease, and a 6.8-fold higher likelihood of needing medical care or leave. Affected individuals reported significant impairments in mobility, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, with 20.7% needing to adjust their work schedules. Overall, patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome require ongoing monitoring and rehabilitation, and further socio-economic impact studies are needed.">

        <tr id="Introduction An unprecedented breadth of longitudinal viral and multi-scale immunological data has been gathered during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the high complexity, non-linearity, multi-dimensionality, mixed anatomic sampling, and possible autocorrelation of available immune data, it is challenging to identify the components of the innate and adaptive immune response that drive viral elimination. Novel mathematical models and analytical approaches are required to synthesize contemporaneously gathered cytokine, transcriptomic, flow cytometry, antibody response, and viral load data into a coherent story of viral control, and ultimately to discriminate drivers of mild versus severe infection. Methods We investigated a dataset describing innate, SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell, and antibody responses in the lung during early and late stages of infection in immunologically naïve rhesus macaques. We used multi-model inference and ensemble modeling approaches from ecology and weather forecasting to compare and combine various competing models. Results and discussion Model outputs suggest that the innate immune response plays a crucial role in controlling early infection, while SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells correspond to later viral elimination, and anti-spike IgG antibodies do not impact viral dynamics. Among the numerous genes potentially contributing to the innate response, we identified IFI27 as most closely linked to viral load decline. A 90% knockdown of the innate response from our validated model resulted in a ~10-fold increase in peak viral load during infection. Our approach provides a novel methodological framework for future analyses of similar complex, non-linear multi-component immunologic data sets.">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a concern for world health since it may impact both the upper (nose, throat, sinuses) and lower (trachea, lungs) respiratory tracts. Death (at a rate of 10%), respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are among the problems that might arise. Recent years have seen a global spread of zoonotic coronaviruses, which have caused human epidemics such as MERS and SARS. Various clinical symptoms may be seen in this sickness because to the numerous changes in intestinal homeostasis caused by SARS-CoV-2. Because of the beneficial impact that probiotics have on the host immune system, gastrointestinal disorders may now be effectively treated. This article discusses the close relationship between what we eat, the bacteria in our gut, and the risk of contracting the COV-19 virus. 
Conclusion: The relationship between gut microbiota, dietary factors, and COVID-19 severity indicates that the microbiome may influence immune regulation. Imbalances in microbial communities and reduced diversity can intensify inflammation, potentially worsening COVID-19 outcomes. Strategies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary changes might provide therapeutic benefits by improving gut health and strengthening immune defenses. However, further research is required to clarify these mechanisms and establish effective interventions.">

A clinical test distinguishing between mild and severe cases could inform effective treatment strategies. Toward the latter stages of the pandemic, it became evident that vaccination or prior infection cannot entirely prevent reinfection. However, they are crucial in reducing the risk of severe disease by inducing T-cell memory. T cell receptors (TCRs), which can be obtained from human blood, serve as valuable biomarkers for monitoring T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we investigated the associations between TCR metrics and COVID-19 severity and found significant associations. Furthermore, such associations could depend on the subset of TCRs used (e.g., TCRs from CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells) and when the TCRs were collected.">

        <tr id="Understanding the perturbed lung immune cell distribution and their functionality in tuberculosis is well documented; however, limited reports covered their disruption, if any, in diabetes-tuberculosis (DM-TB) comorbid conditions. Here, we measured serum cytokines and employed single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms that govern the heterogeneity in host immune response in DM- TB comorbid conditions. Diabetes associated with chronic hyperinflammation and reduced lung- infiltrating immune cells delayed the immune response to Mycobacterial infection. scRNA-seq of lung CD3+ and CD11c+ cells revealed compromised adaptive and innate immunity, with decreased Th1 and M1 macrophage populations in DM-TB mice. A dampened immune response, marked by increased IL- 16 signaling and reduced TNF and IFN-II responses observed in DM-TB. This study highlights chronic inflammation, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia associated with diabetes impairing anti-TB immunity, and selective inhibition of aberrant IL-16 secretion and Th17 cell activation might provide strategies for better management of this comorbidity. Highlights Elevated serum IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17A levels reflect hyperinflammation in diabetic mice. Lung CD3+ and CD11c+ cell single-cell RNA-seq profiles reveals inflammaging in diabetic mice.

        <tr id="Accurately tracking dynamic state transitions is crucial for modeling and predicting biological outcomes, as it captures heterogeneity of cellular responses. To build a model to predict bacterial infection in single cells, we have monitored in parallel infection progression and metabolic parameters in thousands of human primary macrophages infected with the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. By combining livecell imaging with a novel tool for classifying cells based on infection outcomes, we were able to trace the specific evolution of metabolic parameters linked to distinct outcomes, such as bacterial replication or cell death. Our findings revealed that early changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and in the production of mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (mROS) are associated with macrophages that will later support bacterial growth. We used these data to train an explainable machine-learning model and achieved 83% accuracy in predicting L. pneumophila replication in single, infected cells before bacterial replication starts. Our results highlight backtracking as a valuable tool to gain new insights in host-pathogen interactions and identify early mitochondrial alterations as key predictive markers of success of bacterial infection.">

        <tr id="Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has facilitated a deeper comprehension of the molecular mechanisms behind eye diseases and has prompted the selection of precise therapeutic targets by examining the cellular and molecular intricacies at the single-cell level. This review delineates the pivotal role of scRNA-seq in elucidating the functions of innate immune cells within the context of ocular pathologies. Recent advancements in scRNA-seq have revealed that innate immune cells, both from the periphery and resident in the retina, are actively engaged in various stages of multiple eye diseases. Notably, resident microglia and infiltrating neutrophils exhibit swift responses during the initial phase of injury, while peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages exhibit transcriptomic profiles akin to those of activated microglia, suggesting their potential for long-term residence within the retina. The scRNA-seq analyses have underscored the cellular heterogeneity and gene expression alterations within innate immune cells, which, while sharing commonalities, exhibit disease-specific variations. These insights have not only broadened our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms in eye diseases but also paved the way for the identification of candidate targets for targeted therapeutic interventions. The application of scRNA-seq technology has heralded a new era in the study of ocular pathologies, enabling a more detailed appreciation of the roles that innate immune cells play across a spectrum of eye diseases.">

        <tr id="Persistent Covid (PC) represents a post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by symptoms that persist for more than 12 weeks after the acute phase. These symptoms, which include chronic fatigue, respiratory distress, cognitive dysfunction, and other multisystem effects, significantly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood, although studies have suggested a multifactorial origin. Proposed factors include viral persistence, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation disturbances, and gut dysbiosis. The identification of these mechanisms could facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, opening new perspectives for the effective management of persistent Covid. The diagnosis of PC is complex due to the diversity of symptoms and the lack of specific biomarkers. At present, therapeutic approaches focus primarily on symptomatic relief, but further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying PC and to develop targeted interventions. This review synthesizes current evidence on the pathophysiological mechanisms of persistent Covid-19, highlighting recent advances and identifying key areas for future research.">

        <tr id="Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) patients are at high risk of severe infections including COVID-19 due to an immune dysregulation affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, our understanding of the immune responses to infection and vaccination in MM patients is limited. To gain more detailed insights into infection- and vaccine-elicited T cell immunity in MM, we studied the CD8+ T cell response on the single-epitope level in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and mRNA-vaccinated MM patients. Methods: We compared peptide/MHC class I tetramer-enriched SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells and antibody responses in MM patients (convalescent: n = 16, fully vaccinated: n = 5, vaccinated convalescent: n = 5) and healthy controls (HCs) (convalescent: n = 58, fully vaccinated: n = 7) either after infection with SARS-CoV-2 alone, complete mRNA vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection and single-shot mRNA vaccination (hybrid immunity). Results: MM patients have lower frequencies and a lower proportion of fully functional virus-specific CD8+ T cells compared to HCs, after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. CD8+ T cell memory subset distribution in MM patients is skewed towards reduced frequencies of central memory (TCM) T cells and higher frequencies of effector memory 1 (TEM1) T cells. In contrast, the humoral immune response was comparable in both cohorts after viral clearance. Notably, CD8+ T cell frequencies as well as the humoral immune response were improved by a single dose of mRNA vaccine in convalescent MM patients. Conclusions: MM patients have relative immunological deficiencies in SARS-CoV-2 immunity but benefit from hybrid immunity. These findings underline the relevance of vaccinations in this vulnerable patient group.">

Of 39 clinical samples collected at the UCI Medical Center in Orange, California, the extended REVEALR panel showed a positive predictive agreement and negative predictive agreement of 100% for IAV, CoV2, and RSV in sequence-verified clinical samples, with 0 false positive results. Additionally, REVEALR was able to detect a synthetic IBV genome and precisely identify the viruses from clinical samples that were combined to simulate a patient infected with more than one virus.

        <tr id="Background and Objectives In multiple sclerosis (MS), immune cells invade the CNS and destroy myelin. Macrophages contribute to demyelination and myelin repair, and their role in each process depends on their ability to acquire specific phenotypes in response to external signals. In this article, we assess whether defects in MS patient macrophage responses may lead to increased inflammation or lack of neuroregenerative effects. Methods CD14+CD16− monocytes from patients with MS and healthy controls (HCs) were activated in vitro to obtain homeostatic-like, proinflammatory, and proregenerative macrophages. Macrophage activation profiles were assessed through RNA sequencing and metabolomics. Surface molecule expression of CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR and myelin phagocytic capacity were evaluated with flow cytometry. Macrophage supernatant capacity to influence oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation toward an astrocytic or oligodendroglia fate was also tested. Results We observed that MS patient monocytes ex vivo recapitulate their preferential activation toward the CD16+ phenotype, a subset of proinflammatory cells overrepresented in MS lesions. Functionally, MS patient macrophages display a decreased capacity to phagocytose human myelin and a deficit of processing myelin after ingestion. In addition, MS patient macrophage supernatant favors astrocytes over oligodendrocyte differentiation when compared with HC macrophage supernatant. Furthermore, even when exposed to homeostatic or proregenerative stimuli, MS patient macrophages uphold a proinflammatory transcriptomic profile with higher levels of cytokine/chemokine. Of interest, MS patient macrophages exhibit a distinct metabolic signature with a mitochondrial energy metabolism blockage. Transcriptomic data are further substantiated by metabolomics studies that reveal perturbations in the corresponding metabolic pathways. Discussion Our results show an intrinsic defect of MS patient macrophages, reminiscent of innate immune cell memory in MS, lifting macrophage importance in the disease and as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, making them a significant public health concern. During infection, respiratory viruses, including Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), trigger an antiviral immune response, specifically boosting the inflammatory response that plays a critical role in their pathogenesis. The inflammatory response induced by respiratory viruses can be a double-edged sword since it can be initially induced to be antiviral and protective/reparative from virus-induced injuries. Still, it can also be detrimental to host cells and tissues. However, the mechanisms that differentiate the complex crosstalk between favorable host inflammatory responses and harmful inflammatory responses are poorly understood. This review explores the complex interplay between viral pathogens and the host immune response, mainly focusing on the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of VRIs. We discuss how inflammation can both contain and exacerbate the progression of viral infections, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and emerging drugs for modulating the aberrant inflammatory responses during VRIs.">

        <tr id="Dear editor We have carefully reviewed Gambari and Finotti’s letter concerning our recent review, “Interplay of Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) and SARS-CoV-2: Unveiling the Complex Mechanisms of Inflammation and Severity in COVID-19 Infections”. Their thoughtful comments provide a valuable perspective that deepens the scientific discourse on therapeutic strategies, particularly by exploring microRNAs (miRNAs) as regulatory agents within the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Their suggestion to employ specific miRNAs - such as miR-93 and miR-145-5p - as modulators of TLR4 signaling aligns closely with our goal of attenuating the heightened immune response associated with severe COVID-19 cases. As Gambari and Finotti aptly highlight, miRNAs could serve as precise regulators of TLR4-driven cytokine production, thus dampening the intensity of the inflammatory cascade that can lead to adverse clinical outcomes. Specifically, applying miRNA mimics, such as miR-93-5p, which targets pro-inflammatory pathways, offers a promising approach to modulate the TLR4/NF-κB axis, potentially reducing cytokine storm severity. Their approach to miRNA-based therapeutics introduces a sophisticated therapeutic paradigm. This strategy, which extends beyond the direct inhibition of TLR4, may allow modulation of downstream inflammatory mediators and enable a finely tuned immune response. Such a multi-tiered strategy could address the immune dysregulation observed in severe COVID-19 cases, minimizing hyper-inflammation while preserving essential antiviral functions. Further, Gambari and Finotti also present evidence indicating that miRNAs can inhibit NF-κB-mediated expression of key pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8">

        <tr id="Acute COVID-19 is a viral infection caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in dramatically decreased peripheral blood CD3+T cell count apparently due to alterations of thymic T cell maturation, that can persist long term afterwards. Therefore, we analyzed the levels of peripheral blood TRECs (T-cell receptor excision circles), and investigated the main alterations in peripheral blood T cell subsets in COVID-19 convalescents. We performed molecular quantification of TRECs with “TREC/KREC-AMP PS” kit and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes from three groups of patients. The first group contained 109 samples from COVID-19 convalescents (6–12 month post-acute COVID-19) with normal levels of TRECs (TRECn); the second was formed from COVID-19 convalescents (6–12 month post-acute COVID-19) with decreased levels of TRECs (TREClow, n = 29), and healthy control group (HC, n = 18). We noticed no significant differences between all three groups in CD3+T cell relative and absolute numbers. However, CD4+T cell frequencies were decreased in TREClow and TRECn groups compared to HC (40.8% (31.6; 50.1) and 46.4% (40.0; 53.0) vs 53.5% (47.36; 56.9), p 0.001 and р = 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, Th cell levels were decreased in TREClow patients vs HC and TRECn groups (701 cell/1 µL (478; 807) vs 1005 cell/1 µL (700; 1419), р = 0.020, and 876 cell/ 1 µL (661; 1046), р = 0.008, respectively). Finally, both groups of COVID-19 convalescents had increased frequencies of circulating CD8+T cells — 29.4% (20.7; 39.7) in TREClow group, 26.5% (21.1; 32.7) in TRECn group vs 21.3% (17.1; 26.0) in healthy controls (p = 0.024 and р = 0.026, respectively). In TRECn group, CD8+T cell count was elevated vs control range (508 cell/1 µL (372; 622) vs 356 cell/1 µL (247; 531), р = 0.044). Thus, COVID-19 convalescents (6–12 month post-acute COVID-19) showed an imbalance in CD4+and CD8+T cell level even at 6–12 months post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the observed changes in peripheral blood T cells could be closely related to the alterations in thymic T cell maturation and differentiation. Such a long-term decline in TREC levels in the circulation may have a profound impact on immune system functions and requires immunocorrection therapy.">

We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

 Introduction: Cytokine storm (CS) is a severe hyperinflammatory disorder characterized by the overproduction of diverse inflammatory cytokines, manifesting as high fever, vascular leakage, nausea, hypotension, and even multi-organ failure. CS can occur as a complication in various conditions, primarily chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These represent the three major triggers of CS: iatrogenic causes, infections, and autoimmune conditions. Given the heterogeneity of CS triggers, the clinical features and immune landscapes of CS vary widely, necessitating tailored management strategies. However, the detailed immune profiles of CS across these diverse settings are not well characterized, hindering the identification of common and distinct mechanisms underlying this hyperinflammatory complication.
 Methods and Results: Here, we constructed a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in CS with data from three representative disease settings: CAR-T cell therapy, COVID-19, and SLE. The total sample count is 416, encompassing 2,304,606 cells. We collected 111 samples from multiple myeloma (MM) patients who received anti-BCMA CAR-T treatment and experienced CS events at our center, with ethical approval and informed consent from all participants. The scRNA-seq data for COVID-19 (n=221), SLE (n=40), and healthy donor controls (n=44) were retrieved from online open-access publications. Samples from the progression stage of each disease showed significantly elevated expression of CS-related genes, indicating an inflammatory status. We further analyzed the enriched cellular subclusters and expression profiles of these samples to reveal the unique CS landscape of each disease. The results showed that CS following CAR-T therapy was strongly associated with actively proliferating CD8+ T cells, with gene expressions enriched in T cell function-related pathways, such as MAPK and NLR signaling pathways. We also identified an increased percentage of CD8+ exhausted T cells in CS following CAR-T therapy, which might significantly contribute to the abnormal inflammatory responses. Moreover, COVID-19 progression was characterized by unique dynamics of myeloid immune cells, particularly CD14+ monocytes with S100A8 expression and neutrophils with enhanced interferon signaling. Interestingly, in myeloid immune cells from the COVID-19 progression stage, KEGG analysis revealed significantly enriched expressions of genes involved in neuronal transduction, suggesting the potential crosstalk between systemic inflammation and neuronal functions. In SLE, translation activities and ribosome functions were significantly elevated in B cells and plasma cells. Additionally, myeloid immune cells in SLE were enriched for genes involved in phagocytosis, antigen processing, and antigen presentation, showing the over-active status of phagocytotic monocytes/macrophages, which contributes to systemic inflammation.
 Significance: Our large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of CS in three distinct disease contexts uncovered the unique and shared immune landscapes underlying CS across different conditions. Our findings highlight the distinct contributions of specific immune cell subclusters and signaling pathways in each disease context, suggesting potential targets for tailored therapeutic strategies and advancing our understanding of this complex hyperinflammatory complication.

Proactive clinical management is hampered by a lack of biological understanding of this subclinical ‘at-risk’ state and the changes underlying disease development. In a cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-omics study of peripheral immunity in the autoantibody-positive at-risk for RA period, we identified systemic inflammation, proinflammatory-skewed B cells, expanded Tfh17-like cells, epigenetic bias in naive T cells, TNF+IL1B+ monocytes resembling a synovial macrophage population, and CD4 T cell transcriptional features resembling those suppressed by abatacept (CTLA4-Ig) in RA patients. Our findings characterize pathogenesis prior to clinical diagnosis and suggest the at-risk state exhibits substantial immune alterations that could potentially be targeted for early intervention to delay or prevent autoimmunity.

        <tr id="The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a severe threat to human health since December 2019. Immune characteristics and clinical symptoms manifested by COVID-19 patients of the most recent new strains have not been reported.We retrospectively investigated 450 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection from December 2022 to January 2023. Clinical information and peripheral blood of the patients were obtained and analyzed for serum IL-6 levels and T cell sub-types. Post hoc analysis was performed to uncover immunological and involved COVID-19-associated pneumonia differences between patients with different underlying diseases and ages.The median age of the patients was 75.5 years old. 60% of the patients were male and 40% were female. The most common symptoms were cough (344/450,76.4%), fever (317/450, 70.4%), expectoration (199/450, 44.2%) and wheeze (143/450, 31.8%). The mean hospital stay was 11.85 days (range: 1–57). 92% of the patients recovered in a month. The level of serum IL-6 was significantly higher in patients without underlying diseases compared with patients with hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer and diabetes (p < 0.001). Serum IL-6 level was significantly higher in patients who were 66–79 years old than that in patients aged 65 years and younger (p < 0.001). Peripheral CD8+T cell percentage was significantly higher in patients aged 65 years and younger than that in patients aged 80 years and older (p = 0.05). The mean involved ground-glass opacity area of the lung of all studied patients found by chest computed tomography (CT) at the time of initial onset of symptoms was 35.7%. Fifty-seven out of 132 (43.2%) patients who had assessable CT scans at 4–12 weeks after infection completely recovered with no chest CT abnormality. Involved ground-glass area of the lung of patients with diabetes or without underlying disease was significantly more severe than that in patients with COPD (p = 0.041 and p = 0.017, respectively). Involved ground-glass area of the lung of patients aged 80 years and older was significantly more severe than that in patients aged 65 years and younger (p = 0.031).92% of COVID-19 patients infected with Omicron XBB sub-variants of SARS-CoV-2 can recover well in a month. Patients aged 80 years and older who have a lower lymphocyte percentage experienced more severe pneumonia than patients aged 65 years and younger having a higher lymphocyte percentage. Serum IL-6 level can be a recovery indicator for patients with COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It primarily affects the respiratory system but can also impact other significant organs. Its rapid spread has heightened interest in biomarkers for screening and early diagnosis. This study evaluated D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and complete blood count (CBC) levels in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy individuals. A total of 50 healthy individuals and 50 COVID-19 patients, aged 20 to 65, were included in the study, excluding individuals with conditions such as leukemia, thalassemia, or pregnancy.  Whole blood and plasma samples were collected for CBC and D-dimer assays and stored at 2-4°C. The COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, white blood cells (WBC), granulocytes, and granulocyte percentage as compared with the healthy individuals (p<0.01), lower levels of lymphocyte percentage, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (p<0.01), as shown. The severe COVID-19 cases often show elevated D-dimer levels, indicating a higher risk of thrombosis. Increased CRP levels correlate with more severe conditions and help assess inflammation severity. A CBC provides insights into blood components, like RBC and WBC, and platelets. During COVID-19, CBC results may reveal lymphopenia, a low lymphocyte count linked to increased severity.

        <tr id="Interest to the topic of coronavirus infection remains unabated. At the same time, there is insufficient information in the literature on the clinical course of COVID-19 in systemic sclerosis (SSc), a systemic autoimmune disease associated with high mortality.Objective: to identify the characteristics of coronavirus disease in SSc and risk factors for severe COVID-19 and death.Material and methods. A retrospective analysis of data from patients with SSc was performed. The analyzed cohort included patients from the registry of the Systemic Sclerosis Laboratory of V.A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology. Information about the history of novel coronavirus infection was obtained by telephone interview 10 months after the outbreak of the pandemic. COVID-19 was diagnosed if there was a positive oral cavity/nasopharynx PCR swab, if antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were present and/or characteristic symptoms and computed tomography (CT) changes in the lungs were present.Results and discussion. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 57 (52%) patients with SSc. Their median age was 58 [31; 79] years. The majority were women (n=48, 84%) with a limited form of SSc (n=37, 65%). Fifteen (26%) patients had diffuse, 4 (7%) had overlapping (SSc-polymyositis and SSc-rheumatoid arthritis) and 1 (2%) had visceral SSc. Almost 2/3 (74%) of patients with COVID-19 had SSc associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD), with 40% of them having >20% lung parenchymal involvement.All patients received low-dose prednisone therapy, 95% received immunosuppressive therapy and in half of the cases mycophenolate mofetil; rituximab was used in 40% of patients.Chest CT scan was performed in 51 (89%) patients. Pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection was detected in 46 (90%) of them: CT1 (up to 25% lung involvement) – in 10 (20%), CT2 (25–50% involvement) – in 21 (41%) and CT3 (50–75% involvement) – in 15 (29%); in 5 (10%) cases no changes were detected on CT.Mild and moderate course of the viral infection was observed in 19 (33%) and 18 (32%) patients respectively, severe infection – in 20 (35%), including fatal cases in 12 (21%).Conclusion. Patients with SSc infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of severe coronavirus infection, often due to the association of the underlying disease with ILD and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, including biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In case of COVID-19 development the high incidence of cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities that characterize SSc may contribute to a decrease in the efficacy of therapy for both the underlying disease and coronavirus infection, generally worsening the prognosis in these patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dengue virus (DENV) infection poses a significant global health threat, yet our understanding of its immunopathogenesis remains incomplete due to limitations of existing models. Here, we establish an in vitro whole-blood model using hirudin, an anticoagulant that preserves complement activity and cellular interactions, to study DENV infection. Our model reveals the susceptibility of all major leukocyte populations to DENV infection, with monocytes and granulocytes demonstrating high permissiveness and production of infectious virus progeny. Notably, granulocytes emerge as previously unrecognized targets of DENV infection, highlighting the importance of studying viral tropism within a physiologically relevant context. We also observed efficient DENV binding to B cells, but limited production of infectious virus, suggesting a potential role in viral sequestration or immune dysregulation. Interestingly, both NK and T cells, while less permissive, were also found to be susceptible to DENV infection. Our ex vivo analysis of whole blood from DENV-infected patients confirms the susceptibility of granulocytes, monocytes, B cells, natural killer cells, and T cells to infection, further validating the clinical relevance of our model. Additionally, we observed dynamic changes in circulating blood cell populations during acute dengue, potentially reflecting both direct virus-mediated effects and immune responses. This whole-blood model offers a valuable tool for investigating the complex interplay between DENV and host factors, facilitating a deeper understanding of dengue pathogenesis and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a significant global health threat, with increasing incidence in endemic regions and expanding geographic range due to factors like global warming. Current models for studying DENV pathogenesis often lack the complexity of the human immune system, hindering the development of effective therapies and vaccines. To address this, we have established the first in vitro whole-blood model using hirudin, preserving critical immune components and cellular interactions. This model reveals granulocytes as previously unrecognized targets of productive DENV infection, challenging existing paradigms of viral tropism. Our ex vivo analysis of patient blood samples confirms the clinical relevance of this finding and validates our model’s utility. This unique model offers a powerful platform for future studies to dissect the complex interactions between DENV and the host immune system, including the roles of different leukocyte populations, ultimately informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this devastating disease.">

        <tr id="A positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID- 19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.">

        <tr id="The heart is a key target organ in SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the illness stage of acute Covid-19, fibrin thrombi frequently form within the coronary microcirculation, including the vasa vasorum. These thrombi are predominantly located in the abluminal spaces, the sites of pericyte location, of the vessel wall, in both the microvascular and epicardial vessels. A hallmark histopathological finding is the presence of diffuse, focal fibrin deposits surrounding myocardial fibres, which exhibit varying degrees of degeneration and atrophy. This process contributes to myocardial injury, which is reflected both biochemically and clinically in the acute and long-term phases of Covid-19. Myocardial fibrosis results from this pathological cascade, without a concurrent cellular inflammatory response associated with the myocardial stromal fibrin deposits. During the convalescent stage of acute Covid-19, focal myocardial fibrosis and the presence of thrombi within myocardial vessels remain apparent but sparse. Vascular changes, such as fibrin thrombi within the cardiac microcirculation, exhibit similarities to those observed in the pulmonary microcirculation in Covid-19.
In Covid-19, the vascular findings of fibrin thrombi deposits within the cardiac micro vascular circulation are like those seen within the pulmonary microcirculation. ">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bacillus anthracis causes anthrax through a combination of bacterial infection and toxemia. As a major virulence factor of B. anthracis, anthrax lethal toxin (LT) is a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase, exerting its cytotoxicity through proteolytic cleavage of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases, thereby shutting down the MAPK pathways. Anthrax lethal toxin induces host lethality mostly by targeting the cardiovascular system. Although the enzymatic activity and the molecular targets of LT have long been known, the detailed mechanisms underlying cellular/tissue/organ toxicity are still poorly understood. In this work, we sought to investigate the mechanism of LT-induced cellular damage in the cardiovascular system. We demonstrate for the first time that anthrax lethal toxin has potent inhibitory effects on the central metabolism of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. This is likely due to the observed downregulating of c-Myc expression through the toxin-induced inhibition of the ERK pathway. Since c-Myc is a master transcription factor controlling the expression of many rate-limiting metabolic enzymes in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, LT’s downregulation of c-Myc may lead to the observed bioenergetic collapse, particularly, in cardiomyocytes. Since cardiac cell contraction requires continuous production of large amounts of ATP, potent inhibition of the bioenergetics of cardiomyocytes would be incompatible with life. Thus, LT-induced lethality through targeting cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells appears to be a consequence of a bioenergetic collapse, likely due to the toxin’s potent inhibitory activity on the MEK-ERK-c-Myc-metabolic/bioenergetic axis within these target cells of cardiovascular system. IMPORTANCE Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) is a major virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis, the causative pathogen of anthrax disease. Anthrax lethal toxin is a metalloproteinase that cleaves and inactivates MEKs, thereby shutting down MAPK pathways, leading to host mortality primarily through targeting of the cardiovascular system. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the toxin’s cellular and tissue toxicity are still poorly understood. Here, we found that anthrax lethal toxin has potent inhibitory activity on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. These effects appear to be the consequence of downregulation of c-Myc, a master transcription factor that controls many rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. With the high demand on energy for cardiac contraction, the potent inhibition of cardiomyocyte metabolism by LT would be incompatible with life. This work provides critical insights into why the cardiovascular system is the major in vivo target of LT-induced lethality.">

        <tr id="To effectively reduce the health impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is essential to adopt comprehensive strategies to protect individuals from severe acute respiratory syndrome. In that sense, much effort has been devoted to the discovery and repurposing of effective antiviral and anti-inflammatory molecules. The endogenous peptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] has been recently proposed as a promising anti-inflammatory agent to control respiratory infections. Liposomes also emerged as a safe and effective drug carrier system for local drug delivery to the lungs. In this context, the aim of this study was to develop a liposomal formulation of Ang-(1-7) [LAng (1-7)] and investigate its impact on animal survival as well as its antiviral and anti-inflammatory efficacies after intranasal administration in transgenic K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. The liposomal formulation was prepared by the ethanol injection method, exhibiting a mean diameter of 100 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.1. Following treatment of infected mice every 12 hours for 5 days, LAng (1-7) extended animal survival compared to the control groups that received either empty liposomes, free Ang-(1-7), or phosphate-buffered saline. Furthermore, the treatment with LAng (1-7) significantly decreased the viral load, as well as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor levels in the lungs. Conventional treatment with remdesivir by parenteral route used as a positive control promoted similar effects, leading to improved survival rates and reduced viral load in the lungs without significant effects on IL-6 level. In conclusion, liposomal Ang-(1-7) emerges as a promising formulation to improve the treatment and decrease the severity of respiratory infections, such as COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Recent research has demonstrated significant aberrant activation of the innate immune system in ALS model systems due to mutations in SOD1, TARDBP and C9orf72 through stimulation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway. This pathway can be activated, for example, by cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic DNA that accumulates as a result of chronic DNA damage and defective mitochondria, both of which have been identified as early pathology in FUS-ALS spinal motor neurons (sMNs). Therefore, we analysed innate immune pathways in isogenic and non-isogenic FUSmut iPSC-derived sMNs, which revealed upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway in FUSmut sMNs. Notably, we found evidence for accumulation of cytosolic dsRNA and its sensor RIG-I in FUS-ALS. RIG-I, but not MDA5, was found to be significantly upregulated in FUSmut sMNs, and siRNA-mediated knockdown abolished the increased IFN1 activation in FUSmut sMNs. In post-mortem analysis, RIG-I was highly expressed in the remaining α-MNs. IFN treatment of FUSwt sMNs phenocopied the axonal degeneration of FUSmut sMNs. Mechanistically, DNA damage induction did not increase ISG expression, but dsRNA was increased in the mitochondria of FUSmut sMNs. Mitochondrial transcription, a known source of dsRNA, was found to be upregulated in compartmental axonal RNAseq analysis and its inhibition reduced ISGs in FUS-ALS sMNs. Furthermore, the JAK-STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib alleviated the upregulated ISG expression and reversed the axonal degeneration of sMNs. Finally, we analysed ISG expression in peripheral blood samples from 18 FUS-ALS patients, eight of whom had a significantly elevated interferon signature. Blood ISGs correlated with disease progression rate and negatively with disease duration. RIG-I-mediated innate immune activation in sMNs may be an interesting novel individualised biomarker-driven therapeutic target in (FUS-) ALS. A one-sentence summary of your paper RIG-I-I-mediated innate immune activation is found in FUS-ALS spinal motor neurons caused by cytosolic dsRNA accumulation due to mitochondrial transcriptional activation and is amenable to JAK-STAT inhibition and might thus be an interesting novel individualized biomarker-driven therapeutic approach in (FUS-) ALS">

        <tr id="Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily targets mitochondria. However, the description of mitochondrial signaling in immune cells remains limited in COVID-19. This study aimed to elucidate the pivotal roles played by immune cells and mitochondria in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the resulting clinical outcomes. Methods We obtained epidemiological characteristics, laboratory parameters and T cell mitochondrial damage indicators in 296 COVID-19 patients. And we further evaluated the predictive value of novel T lymphocyte mitochondrial markers and conventional immune inflammatory markers as clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Finally, Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent risk factors associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Results The severe group exhibited lower counts of Mito+CD3+, Mito+CD4+, and Mito+CD8+ cells compared to the non-severe group. Significantly higher positive rates of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+T cell mitochondrial damage were observed in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. The CD3+CD8+T cells MMP-low% had the highest AUC value of 0.864 (95% CI =0.794–0.934) to evaluate COVID-19 outcome. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that CD3+T cells MMP-low%, CD3+CD4+T cells MMP-low% and CD3+CD8+T cells MMP-low% were independent risk factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Our research suggests that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients exhibited mitochondrial impairment with T-lymphocyte. T cells mitochondrial markers can serve as predictive factors and independent risk factors for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Stroke is a severe neurological disease and a major worldwide issue, mostly manifesting as ischemic stroke (IS). In order to create effective treatments for IS, it is imperative to fully understand the underlying pathologies, as the existing therapeutic choices are inadequate. Recent investigations have shown the complex relationships between several programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, and their correlation with immune responses during IS. However, this relationship is still unclear. To address this gap, this review study explored the cellular interactions in the immune microenvironment of IS. Then, to validate prior findings and uncover biomarkers, the study investigated bioinformatics studies. Several pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK), were involved in PCD-immune interactions. The bioinformatics studies reported key biomarkers such as glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), gasdermin D (GSDMD), and TLR4, which have important implications in ferroptosis, cuproptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis respectively. These biomarkers were associated with PCD mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. The immune infiltration analysis consistently revealed a significant correlation between PCD pathways and detrimental immune cells, such as neutrophils and γδ T cells. Conversely, M2 macrophages and T helper cells showed protective effects. In conclusion, considering the intricate network of interactions between immune responses and PCD pathways, this study emphasized the necessity of a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches to address the injuries that are related to this complex network.">

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

Alarmingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the lungs but also influences the heart and brain. Endothelial cell dysfunction and hypercoagulation, which we know occur with this infection, lead to thrombo-inflammation that can manifest as many myriad cardio-cerebrovascular disorders, such as brain fog, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with oxidative stress, protein aggregation, cytokine storm, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the identification of molecular targets involved in these actions could provide strategies for preventing and treating this disease. In particular, the very common enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) has recently been identified as a candidate co-receptor for the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with its involvement in infection. In addition, DPPIV has been reported as a co-receptor for some viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It mediates immunologic reactions and diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, which have been considered the prime risk factors for stroke among other types of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), DPPIV has been implicated in aggravating the course of infection due to its disruptive effect on inflammatory signaling networks and the neuro–glia–vascular unit. Regarding the neurological, physiological, and molecular grounds governing post-COVID-19 fatigue, this review focuses on DPPIV as one of such reasons that progressively establishes cerebrovascular grievances following SARS-CoV infection.">

        <tr id="Hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit diverse immune responses during acute infection, which are associated with a wide range of clinical outcomes. However, understanding these immune heterogeneities and their links to various clinical complications, especially long COVID, remains a challenge. In this study, we performed unsupervised subtyping of longitudinal multi-omics immunophenotyping in over 1,000 hospitalized patients, identifying two critical subtypes linked to mortality or mechanical ventilation with prolonged hospital stay and three severe subtypes associated with timely acute recovery. We confirmed that unresolved systemic inflammation and T-cell dysfunctions were hallmarks of increased severity and further distinguished patients with similar acute respiratory severity by their distinct immune profiles, which correlated with differences in demographic and clinical complications. Notably, one critical subtype (SubF) was uniquely characterized by early excessive inflammation, insufficient anticoagulation, and fatty acid dysregulation, alongside higher incidences of hematologic, cardiac, and renal complications, and an elevated risk of long COVID. Among the severe subtypes, significant differences in viral clearance and early antiviral responses were observed, with one subtype (SubC) showing strong early T-cell cytotoxicity but a poor humoral response, slower viral clearance, and greater risks of chronic organ dysfunction and long COVID. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex and context-dependent nature of COVID-19 immune responses, highlighting the importance of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve both acute and long-term outcomes.">

        <tr id="Myeloid cells including brain-resident (microglia) and peripheral macrophages play a crucial role in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). They respond to disruption of tissue homeostasis associated with disease conditions by acquiring various transcriptional and functional states. Experimental investigation of these states is hampered by the lack of tools that enable accessible and robust reprogramming of human macrophages toward Alzheimer’s disease-relevant molecular and cellular phenotypes in vitro. In this study, we investigated the ability of a cytokine mix, including interleukin-4 (IL4), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1/MCSF), interleukin 34 (IL34) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), to induce reprogramming of cultured human THP-1 macrophages. Our results indicate this treatment led to significant transcriptomic changes, driving THP-1 macrophages towards a transcriptional state reminiscent of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM) collectively referred to as DLAM. Transcriptome profiling revealed gene expression changes related to oxidative phosphorylation, lysosome function, and lipid metabolism. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an increased proportion of DLAM clusters in cytokine mix-treated THP-1 macrophages. Functional assays demonstrated alterations in cell motility, phagocytosis, lysosomal activity, and metabolic and energetic profiles. Our findings provide insights into the cytokine-mediated reprogramming of macrophages towards disease-relevant states, highlighting their role in neurodegenerative diseases and potential for therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Restriction factors block multiple stages of viral infection. Here we describe how NINJ1 controls HSV-1 infection of mouse macrophages, a key cell type during systemic and local acute infection. We observed that Ninj1−/– macrophages are more susceptible to infection than WT cells. Ninj1−/– macrophages exhibited earlier and stronger expression of all kinetic classes of viral proteins, resulting in higher production of infectious viral particles, with initial differences seen in the first few hours post infection. Given the important role of NINJ1 during cell death, we next investigated if NINJ1 restricts HSV-1 in a manner related to its role in cell death. However, infected Ninj1-deficient cells did not exhibit differences in cell death compared to WT controls at early time points in infection where we observe a difference in infection rates. Instead, the higher infection rate in Ninj1−/– macrophages correlated to enhancement in the average numbers of viral particles entering each cell. Finally, we determined the consequences of the altered entry and found higher ISG RNA expression in infected Ninj1−/– cells, which we ascribe to both TLR signaling and STING-mediated recognition. Together, this indicates that the NINJ1 present on WT macrophages reduces HSV-1 entry, which has consequences for the inflammatory phenotype associated with HSV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by the loss of self-tolerance toward insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. Although the etiology of T1D is not fully understood, it is linked to dysregulation of the T-cell compartment. To identify T-cell signatures associated with T1D, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood T-cells from newly diagnosed children, the same children after one year, and healthy donors. We observed reduced expression of genes related to effector and cytotoxic T-cell functions across conventional, unconventional, and regulatory T-cell subsets in diabetic children, particularly at the time of diagnosis. These findings were supported by flow cytometry analysis of the same cohort and by reanalysis of publicly available data. Overall, our results suggest that T1D is associated with impaired T-cell effector differentiation, which may contribute to immune dysregulation and loss of self-tolerance.">

        <tr id="Elimination of latent HIV-1 is a major goal of AIDS research but the host factors determining the size of these reservoirs are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether differences in host gene expression modulate the size of the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive ART. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from fourteen individuals initiating ART during acute infection who demonstrated effective viral suppression but varying magnitude of total HIV-1 DNA were characterized by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways demonstrated increased monocyte activity in participants with undetectable HIV-1 reservoirs. IL1B expression in CD14+ monocytes showed the greatest fold difference. The inverse association of IL1B with reservoir size was validated in an independent cohort comprised of 38 participants with different genetic backgrounds and HIV-1 subtype infections, and further confirmed with intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA®) measurements of intact HIV-1 proviruses in a subset of the samples. Modeling interactions with cell population frequencies showed that monocyte IL1B expression associated inversely with reservoir size in the context of higher frequencies of central memory CD4+ T cells, implicating an indirect effect of IL1B via the cell type well established to be a reservoir for persistent HIV-1. Signatures consisting of co-expressed genes including IL1B were highly enriched in the “TNFα signaling via NF-κB” geneset. Functional analyses in cell culture revealed that IL1B activates NF-κB, thereby promoting productive HIV-1 infection while simultaneously suppressing viral spread, suggesting a natural latency reversing activity to deplete the reservoir in ART treated individuals. Altogether, unbiased high throughput scRNA-seq analyses revealed that monocyte IL1B variation could decrease HIV-1 proviral reservoirs in individuals initiating ART during acute infection.">

        <tr id="We aimed to study transcriptional and phenotypic changes in circulating immune cells associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-19, resolution of pulmonary fibrosis in post-COVID-19-Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and persistence of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Whole blood and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 227 subjects with COVID-19, post-COVID-19 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), IPF and controls. We measured a 50-gene signature (nCounter, Nanostring) previously found to be predictive of IPF and COVID-19 mortality along with plasma levels of several biomarkers by Luminex. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in PBMC (10X Genomics) to determine the cellular source of the 50-gene signature. We identified the presence of three genomic risk profiles in COVID-19 based on the 50-gene signature associated with low, intermediate, or high-risk of mortality and with significant differences in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines. COVID-19 patients in the high-risk group had increased expression of seven genes in CD14+HLA-DRlowCD163+Monocytic-Myeloid-Derived Suppressive cells (7Gene-M-MDSCs) and decreased expression of 43 genes in CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets. The loss of 7Gene-M-MDSC and increased expression of these 43 genes in T cells was seen in survivors with post-COVID-19-ILD. On the contrary, IPF patients had low expression of the 43 genes in CD4 and CD8 T cells. Collectively, we showed that a 50-gene, high-risk profile, predictive of IPF and COVID-19 mortality is characterized by a genomic imbalance in monocyte and T-cell subsets. This imbalance reverses in survivors with post-COVID-19-ILD highlighting genomic differences between post-COVID-19-ILD and IPF.">

        <tr id="Background: Long-COVID disease, is a term that describes the persistent SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, is challenging to diagnose due to its complexity and incompleteness of pathogenesis. Although numerous factors were explored with this condition, the Galanin (GAL) and its receptor 1 (GalR-1) were not extensively studied in this context. Galanin system engaged in the pathophysiology of multiple chronic aging-related diseases, including alcoholism, inflammatory conditions of bowel and skin, and chronic pain. The presented study aimed to evaluate the relationship between tested Galanin system parameters in Long-COVID patients. 
Methods: The amount of GAL and GALR-1 were measured using the ELISA technique in a group of (90) Long-COVID patients and (60) individuals who had healing and were no longer experiencing symptoms of Long-COVID. 
Results: The study reported that Galanin, GalR-1, and Gal/GalR-1 ratio were significantly increased in Long-COVID patients. The study reported statistically higher Galanin levels (p<0.001), higher GALR1 levels (p = 0.007) and higher Gal/GalR1 ratios (p=0.019) in individuals diagnosed with Long-COVID patients and non-patients. According to the ROC analysis, Galanin showed the highest sensitivity (71.7%) followed by GALR1 (60.0%) to discriminate patients from non-patients. 
Conclusion: The findings suggest a direct relationship between Galanin and GALR1 with Long-COVID disease. However, further studies are needed to clarify the precise role of plasma Galanin(GAL) and its receptors(GalR-1) in Long-COVID pathology.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel betacoronavirus, is the causative agent of COVID-19, which has caused economic and social disruption worldwide. To date, many drugs and vaccines have been developed for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and have effectively controlled the global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 is highly mutable, leading to the emergence of new variants that may counteract current therapeutic measures. Electron microscopy (EM) is a valuable technique for obtaining ultrastructural information about the intracellular process of virus replication. In particular, EM allows us to visualize the morphological and subcellular changes during virion formation, which would provide a promising avenue for the development of antiviral agents effective against new SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this review, we present our recent findings using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with electron tomography (ET) to reveal the morphologically distinct types of SARS-CoV-2 particles, demonstrating that TEM and ET are valuable tools for visually understanding the maturation status of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells. This review also discusses the application of EM analysis to the evaluation of genetically engineered RNA viruses.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, triggers a complex immune response, with T regulatory cells (Tregs) playing a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. The current study investigates the function of T regulatory cells during COVID-19 infection and the subsequent recovery period, emphasizing their impact on immune regulation and inflammation control. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Treg subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients at different stages: acute infection, early convalescence, and long-term recovery. Flow cytometry was employed to quantify Tregs including “naïve”, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector cells (TEMRA). Additionally, the functional state of the Tregs was assessed by the expression of purinergic signaling molecules (CD39, CD73). Cytokine profiles were assessed through multiplex analysis. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in the number of Tregs during the acute phase of COVID-19, which correlates with heightened inflammatory markers and increased disease severity. Specifically, we found a decrease in the relative numbers of “naïve” and an increase in EM Tregs, as well as a decrease in the absolute numbers of “naïve” and CM Tregs. During the early convalescent period, the absolute counts of all Treg populations tended to increase, accompanied by a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite this, one year after recovery, the decreased subpopulations of regulatory T cells had not yet reached the levels observed in healthy donors. Finally, we observed the re-establishment of CD39 expression in all Treg subsets; however, there was no change in CD73 expression among Tregs. Understanding these immunological changes across different T regulatory subsets and adenosine signaling pathways offers important insights into the disease’s pathogenesis and provides a broader view of immune system dynamics during recovery.">

        <tr id="Microglia are the immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and become pro-inflammatory/activated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cell surface glycosylation plays an important role in immune cells; however, the N-glycosylation and glycosphingolipid (GSL) signatures of activated microglia are poorly understood. Here, we study comprehensive combined transcriptomic and glycomic profiles using human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived microglia (hiMG). Distinct changes in N-glycosylation patterns in amyloid-β oligomer (AβO) and LPS-treated hiMG were observed. In AβO-treated cells, the relative abundance of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N-glycans decreased, corresponding with a downregulation of MGAT3. The sialylation of N-glycans increased in response to AβO, accompanied by an upregulation of genes involved in N-glycan sialylation (ST3GAL4 and 6). Unlike AβO-induced hiMG, LPS-induced hiMG exhibited a decreased abundance of complex-type N-glycans, aligned with downregulation of mannosidase genes (MAN1A1, MAN2A2, and MAN1C1) and upregulation of ER degradation related-mannosidases (EDEM1-3). Fucosylation increased in LPS-induced hiMG, aligned with upregulated fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) and downregulated alpha-L-fucosidase 1 (FUCA1) gene expression, while sialofucosylation decreased, aligned with upregulated neuraminidase 4 (NEU4). Inhibition of sialyation and fucosylation in AβO- and LPS-induced hiMG alleviated pro-inflammatory responses. However, the GSL profile did not exhibit significant changes in response to AβO or LPS activation. AβO- and LPS- specific glycosylation changes could contribute to impaired microglia function, highlighting glycosylation pathways as potential therapeutic targets for AD.">

        <tr id="At this stage in the COVID-19 pandemic, most infections are "breakthrough" infections that occur in individuals with prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To refine long-term vaccine strategies against emerging variants, we examined both innate and adaptive immunity in breakthrough infections. We performed single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional profiling of primary and breakthrough infections to compare immune responses from unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave. Breakthrough infections were characterized by a less activated transcriptomic profile in monocytes and natural killer cells, with induction of pathways limiting monocyte migratory potential and natural killer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a female-specific increase in transcriptomic and proteomic activation of multiple innate immune cell subsets during breakthrough infections. These insights suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prevents overactivation of innate immune responses during breakthrough infections with discernible sex-specific patterns and underscore the potential of harnessing vaccines in mitigating pathologic immune responses resulting from overactivation.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations in infants and poses a significantly higher risk of respiratory failure than SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. We analyzed blood samples from infants (median age 2.3 months) with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 30), RSV (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 17) using single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, and cytokine profiling. Both viruses triggered comparable interferon responses across PBMC subsets but differed in NK cell and inflammatory responses. Severe RSV cases showed reduced NK cell frequencies, lower IFNG expression, and decreased chromatin accessibility at T-BET and EOMES binding sites. RSV infections were also associated with increased CD4+ TEMRA, memory Treg and transitional B cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by stronger pro-inflammatory signatures, including increased NFKB pathway activity and higher serum TNF concentrations. These findings highlight distinct immune responses to RSV and SARS-CoV-2, providing insights that may inform clinical decisions.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that is one of the most significant challenges to public health over the past few years. Most people are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but older adults are more vulnerable. Aging is one of the major risk factors for the detrimental consequences of COVID-19, likely due to chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, both of which are the characteristics of old age. Immunosenescence refers to the weakening of the immune system with age while inflammaging describes the low-grade chronic inflammation seen in older individuals. One key aspect of human aging is immune deficiency. During aging, our body's defense system weakens, resulting in decreased responses to infection by novel pathogens and a reduced ability to become immunized. The presence of chronic inflammation and viral infection in old age may cause several adverse unpredictable outcomes increasing the propensity and severity of the disease and requires to be considered, enabling people to better prepare for the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. This requires consideration so that individuals can better be prepared to address the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. In this review, we discuss the clinical characteristics of elderly COVID-19 patients and survey the associated molecular pathways that are pivotal for the interactions of the coronavirus and host cellular responses, including immunosenescence, inflammation, telomere attrition, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in major aging signaling pathways, which are crucial for the discovery of new therapeutic and preventive methods in the ongoing pandemic.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID‐19 commonly leads to respiratory issues, yet numerous patients also exhibit a diverse range of neurological conditions, suggesting a detrimental impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 or the viral Spike protein on the central nervous system. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Current understanding of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and host responses driving the pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses. Our findings provide a catalog of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes changing over time and magnitude of these host responses were significantly correlated to viral load.">

        <tr id="With the consistent occurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the prevalence of various ocular complications has increased over time. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this review is to focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and intraocular neuroinflammation and to discuss current evidence and future perspectives, especially possible connections between conditions and potential treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Type I interferons exert their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including but not limited to LY6E, CH25H, IFITM2/3, and IFIH1. However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus's receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2. These data provide new insights into the interplay between host innate antiviral immunity and SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on novel antiviral therapeutics.


IMPORTANCE
Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been identified as a critical host restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PLSCR1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry by downregulating the plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for viral entry. Our findings elucidate a novel host-pathogen interaction that not only deepens our understanding of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 but offers potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Few pathogens have historically been subjected to as intense scientific and clinical scrutiny as SARS-CoV-2. The genetic, immunological, and environmental factors influencing disease severity and post-infection clinical outcomes, known as correlates of immunity, remain largely undefined. Clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to those with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. While most infected individuals return to their former health and fitness within a few weeks, some develop debilitating chronic symptoms, referred to as long-COVID. Autoimmune responses have been proposed as one of the factors influencing long-COVID and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between viral infections and autoimmune pathologies is not new. Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, among others, have been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies and the onset of autoimmune conditions. Given the extensive literature on SARS-CoV-2, here we review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmune pathologies, with a focus on autoantibodies. We closely examine mechanisms driving autoantibody production, particularly their connection with disease severity and long-COVID.">

        <tr id="Objective Vaccination is protective against severe COVID-19 disease, yet whether vaccination reduces COVID-19-associated inflammation in pregnancy has not been established. The objective of this study is to characterize maternal and cord cytokine profiles of acute SARS-CoV-2 “breakthrough” infection (BTI) after vaccination, compared with unvaccinated infection and uninfected controls. Study design 66 pregnant individuals enrolled in the MGH COVID-19 biorepository (March 2020-April 2022) were included. Maternal sera were collected from 26 unvaccinated and 21 vaccinated individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cord sera were collected at delivery. Maternal and cord sera from 19 term dyads without current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed as controls. Cytokines were quantified using the Human Inflammation 20-Plex ProcartaPlex assay. Results There was a significantly higher incidence of severe/critical maternal illness in unvaccinated pregnant individuals with SARS-CoV-2 compared to vaccinated (10/26 (38%) vs. 0/21 (0%), p<0.01). Significantly higher maternal levels of TNFα and CD62P were observed in vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 BTI compared with unvaccinated individuals with infection (p<0.05). Network correlation analyses revealed a distinct maternal cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals. Neither unvaccinated nor vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in elevated cord cytokines compared to controls. Multivariate analyses demonstrate distinct maternal and cord cytokine profiles in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 at delivery. Conclusion Vaccination was associated with higher maternal cytokine levels during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated infection, which may reflect vaccine-mediated priming of the immune system. A fetal inflammatory response specific to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a deadly human viral disease with a high rate of infection, morbidity, and mortality. Although vaccines and antiviral treatments are available, hospitalizations remain steady, and concerns about long-term consequences persist. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop novel therapies. Here, we analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication while building an antiviral cellular defense. Our study reveals that miR-155 expression is elevated in patients with COVID-19. Using a mouse model transgenic for human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, we evaluated the potential of anti-miR-155 therapy. Treating SARS-CoV-2-infected mice with anti-miR-155 significantly reduced miR-155 expression, improved survival, and slightly increased body weight. Notably, these mice showed altered expression of cytokines in the lungs. These findings suggest anti-miR-155 could be a promising therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm and long-lasting symptoms induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, improving public health outcomes and enhancing global pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 involves several organs, but its basis remains poorly understood. Some infected cells in mice survive the acute infection and persist for extended periods in the respiratory tract but not in other tissues. Here, we describe two experimental models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to assess the effect of viral virulence on previously infected cells. Both approaches use lineage tracking of previously infected cells. In mice infected with a highly pathogenic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) but not alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells survived the acute infection. These cells became activated, differentiated into an AT2-to-AT1 transitional cell state (KRT8+ pre-alveolar type 1 transitional cell state). Additionally, nearby uninfected AT2 cells upregulated the transitional marker KRT8, thereby contributing to lung regeneration. In mice sensitized to infection by transduction with Ad5-hACE2, the infection is nonlethal, and AT1 cells survived the infection. Consequently, recovery in these mice was more rapid. Taken together, these results provide an explanation for how SARS-CoV-2 virulence contributes to poor outcomes and affects clinical recovery and lung regeneration. We also identified a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts lung recovery, even at times when infectious virus cannot be detected.


IMPORTANCE
A major consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is that many survivors have long-term sequelae, which are not well understood. These involve many organs, with the respiratory tract being a common site of long-term effects. Many of these sequelae can be found in mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we have focused on the lungs, with particular interest in the fate and role of cells that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and survived the acute infection. We found that some infected cells survive acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that these surviving cells both contribute to the immune response in the lungs and are involved in lung recovery. These findings illustrate previously unexplored aspects of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia and may be relevant for understanding aspects of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The reaction of different cell types to prion infections is highly heterogeneous. While neurons experience spine retraction and eventually death, astrocytes and microglia undergo strong activation and proliferation. Here we analyzed the cell-type specific responses to prion diseases by establishing a spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mice infected with RML prion strain. Brain areas with severe neuronal loss, such as the thalamus and cerebellum, experienced intense microgliosis. Starting from 30 weeks post-inoculation, we observed the accumulation of a novel microglial subpopulation characterized by strong expression of Gpnmb in these brain regions. The molecular profile of Gpnmb+ microglia reflected a state of enhanced phagocytic activity with upregulation of genes associated with lysosomal function and degradation, including vacuolar ATPase V0 domain subunit d2 (Atp6v0d2) and Galectin-3 (Lgals3). In microglial-like, murine BV2 cells, Gpnmb upregulation was induced by soluble find-me signals released during apoptosis, but not by apoptotic bodies or prion accumulation. Gpnmb ablation in BV2 cells impaired their ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells, underscoring its essential role in maintaining microglial phagocytosis. Our findings define Gpnmb⁺ microglia as a distinct, apoptosis-driven phagocytic state, linking neuronal loss to microglial activation in prion disease. The upregulation of GPNMB in sCJD patients, along with its role in apoptotic clearance and lysosomal function, positions it as both a key regulator of microglial responses and a potential biomarker of disease progression.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus responsible for COVID-19, interacts with the host immune system through complex mechanisms that significantly influence disease outcomes, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. These interactions are crucial in determining the disease's severity and the host's ability to clear the virus. Given the virus's substantial socioeconomic impact, high morbidity and mortality rates, and public health importance, understanding these mechanisms is essential. This article examines the diverse innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2's structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, along with nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open reading frames. These proteins play pivotal roles in immune modulation, facilitating viral replication, evading immune detection, and contributing to severe inflammatory responses such as cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus employs strategies like suppressing type I interferon production and disrupting key antiviral pathways, including MAVS, OAS-RNase-L, and PKR. This study also explores the immune pathways that govern the activation and suppression of immune responses throughout COVID-19. By analyzing immune sensing receptors and the responses initiated upon recognizing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, this review elucidates the complex pathways associated with the innate immune response in COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for therapeutic interventions and informs public health strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody responses after infection and/or vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody responses among naturally infected individuals and individuals who achieved hybrid immunity in a large Canadian cohort. We demonstrate that anti-Spike IgGs and neutralizing antibody dynamics vary greatly among individuals with COVID-19, in peak antibody levels, rate of waning, and longevity of the antibody response. Additionally, we found an association between robust antibody responses and individuals with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms during the first-month post-symptom onset. For individuals who achieved hybrid immunity, a robust increase in anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibodies followed the first vaccination dose; however, there was a minimal increase in the anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers after administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies elicited by the wild-type virus alone were largely ineffective against emerging variants of concern in our natural infection-only cohort, in contrast to a much broader and more robust neutralization profile observed in individuals who achieved hybrid immunity. Our findings emphasize the need for global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts to further sustain protective immune responses required to minimize viral spread and disease severity in the population. As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, understanding the interplay between previous infections, vaccine durability, and virus evolution will be critical for guiding ongoing vaccination strategies.


IMPORTANCE
A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody response after infection and/or vaccination. Our paper addresses this in a large Canadian cohort with antibody responses that were generated by natural infection as well as vaccine in some persons studied.">

        <tr id="Both B-cell- and T-cell-mediated immunity are crucial for the effective clearance of viral infection, but little is known about the dynamic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in people living with HIV (PLWH) after a full course of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.In this study, fifty people living with HIV (PLWH) and thirty healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled to assess B-cell and T-cell responses at the day before the vaccination (T0), two weeks after the first dose (T1), two months after the first dose (T2), the day of the third dose (T3), one month after the third dose (T4), three months after the third dose (T5) and 12 months (T6) after the third dose.SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses were induced in people living with HIV (PLWH), and these responses lasted at least one year after the third vaccine dose. However, the peak frequencies of Spike-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in PLWH were lower than those in HIV-negative controls. In addition, the expansion of activated B cells, memory B cells and plasma cells after primary vaccination was observed, but the percentages of these cells were decreased at T6 and were comparable to those at T0. Additionally, the percentages of activated T cells, exhausted T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with enhanced functional activity were increased following the administration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, PLWH had lower percentages of plasma cells, RBD-specific B cells, circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells and CD38+ cTfh cells, and the percentages of the latter two types of cells were positively correlated with the titer of neutralizing antibodies, indicating these differences may account for the weaker immune responses induced in PLWH.These data suggest that specific B-cell and T-cell responses could be sustained for at least one year after receiving the third vaccination. Our findings emphasize that the weak SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses induced in PLWH have implications for clinical decision-making and public health policy for PLWH with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

Understanding the mechanisms of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for addressing COVID-19–related liver pathology and developing targeted therapies. This editorial discusses the significance of ACE2 in hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, drawing on the research by Jacobs et al. Their findings indicate that hepatic ACE2 expression, frequency of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and severity of liver injury are elevated in patients with pre-existing chronic liver diseases. These data suggest that hepatic ACE2 could be a promising therapeutic target for COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, particularly low-density neutrophils (LDNs), are believed to contribute to acute COVID-19 severity. Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2–infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers, thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade could be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low-density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results also support the involvement of SARS-CoV-2–endothelial cell interactions in viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis is a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. The host response correlates of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis remain unclear, thereby limiting therapeutic development. We therefore performed proteomic and transcriptomic phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis in Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. We included a bioenergetics focus given the emerging role of mitochondrial function in enteroviral myocarditis. Early (<30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). Values are log10 transformed, and p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons across the full twenty biomarkers (six shown here; * indicates a p-value < 0.05). CRP = C-Reactive Protein; IFNG = Interferon Gamma ; PCT= Procalcitonin; TNFR1 = Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; DDIMER = D-dimer; and IL1RA = Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Methods We previously adjudicated five unvaccinated pre-Delta SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis cases among 5265 MHS beneficiaries who enrolled into the EPICC study with COVID-19; four of these cases had blood collected. We matched myocarditis cases 1:10 with sex, age, comorbidity, and blood sampling-time matched controls (SARS-CoV-2 infection with no myocarditis) from the EPICC study. Cases and controls underwent comparison of early (< 30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay (with multiplicity adjustment). We also performed early whole blood transcriptomic sequencing with DESeq2 and GSEA analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways, including mitochondrial (mtDNA) regulated innate immune pathways (with FDR for multiple comparisons). Gene set enrichment analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). FDR = False Discovery Rate; NES = Normalized enrichment score. Results We detected higher post-infection Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1) and procalcitonin (PCT) plasma concentrations in myocarditis cases versus matched controls (TNFR1: 0.33 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.032; PCT: 0.59 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.02) (Fig 1). We noted no statistically significant difference in the 18 other proteomic markers tested. GSEA analysis noted upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS pathway genes, and downregulated mtDNA innate immune genes, in cases versus controls (FDR < 0.05) (Fig 2). Conclusion In this MHS study, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was associated with elevation of TNFR1 and PCT secretion, upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS gene expression, and downregulated mtDNA innate immunity. While constrained by small sample sizes of a rare complication, these biomarker associations prompt mechanistic studies which may direct development of therapies for myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens.

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

        <tr id="While Influenza Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are considered as a significant health burden in children, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes milder diseases in this age group compared to adults. To investigate the involvement of the upper respiratory tract human airway epithelium (HAE) in this pattern, we established an in-house model of reconstituted HAE cultured in air-liquid interface from nasal swabs of children and adults and characterised it before and after ex vivo respiratory viral infections using focused and unbiased approaches. Fully differentiated paediatric HAE exhibited an increasing induction level of genes related to mucociliary clearance, while higher expression of innate immune pathways was found in the ones from adults. While similar viral replication kinetics in both age groups were shown for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A Virus (IAV), RSV and Rhinovirus (RV) infection, transcriptomic analysis showed stronger and earlier induction of IFN-related pathways in SARS-CoV-2-infected HAE from children compared to IAV, RSV and RV. IAV and RSV had the weakest innate immune response increase in HAE from children versus adults. RV infection showed an intermediate pattern, resembling SARS-CoV-2 more than RSV or IAV. Our work demonstrates a distinct sensing of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses ex vivo, which may contribute to the milder course of disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected children and argues for a role of early virus-HAE interaction in shaping viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that innate immune responses towards respiratory viruses are virus-specific and differ between age groups. Hence, findings on SARS-CoV-2 cannot be extrapolated to other respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunocompromised patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often have prolonged viral shedding, and some are clinically suspected of reinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data on this issue are limited. This study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 variants in serially collected respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients with prolonged viral shedding for over 12 weeks or relapsed viral shedding after at least 2 weeks of viral clearance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From February 2022 to September 2023, we prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had hematologic malignancies or had undergone transplantation and were admitted to a tertiary hospital. Weekly saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from enrolled patients for at least 12 weeks after diagnosis. Genomic RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on samples, and those testing positive underwent viral culture to isolate the live virus. Spike gene full sequencing via Sanger sequencing and real-time reverse transcription-PCR for detecting mutation genes were conducted to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants.


RESULTS
Among 116 enrolled patients, 20 with prolonged or relapsed viral shedding were screened to identify the variants. Of these 20 patients, 7 (35%) exhibited evidence of re-infection; one of 8 patients with prolonged viral shedding and 6 of 12 with relapsed viral shedding were reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that approximately one-third of immunocompromised patients with persistent or relapsed viral shedding had reinfection with different variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with neurological effects that persist beyond the acute phase, collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “long COVID.” This article discusses the neurological impacts of PASC, which can occur regardless of the initial illness’s severity. Studies indicate that most patients continue to experience symptoms for at least 3 months post-infection. Long-term effects include neurocognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Proposed mechanisms underlying these effects include neuroinflammation, microvascular damage, and autoimmune responses, while direct viral neuroinvasion remains a topic of ongoing debate. SARS-CoV-2 may also worsen pre-existing neurological disorders and increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease. The article highlights the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the variability in outcomes and the mechanisms driving these persistent effects. In addition, it explores the inflammatory pathways linking long COVID to AD. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, activation of shared markers such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, and alterations in amyloid-beta production. The apolipoprotein E4 gene, a known risk factor for AD, is also associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Neuroimaging studies reveal brain changes in COVID-19 survivors, particularly in regions related to cognition and memory, further emphasizing the need for long-term research to assess the potential role of long COVID in exacerbating neurodegenerative diseases.">

In this study, we performed in-depth SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell profiling using flow cytometry. T-cell immunity in pwMS with or without DMTs was evaluated before a first SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination and at one-, two- and six-month follow-up. T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4+ T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4+high and CD4+CD154+ T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8+ T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.">

Case reports describe prolonged COVID19 shedding in patients with malignant hematological disease. Similarly, we observed extended viral shedding in hemato-oncological patients (HP) at our SARS-CoV-2 unit. This raises the question of whether HP are more susceptible to prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and which aspects of immunosuppression contribute to this phenomenon.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Data from HP treated at a single center between 02/2022 and 02/2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, 47 HP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were included. Additional data on 16 HP were retrieved from literature. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (t[SARS+]) was compared between subgroups with different diagnoses, immune status, and HP with and without medical treatment of SARS-CoV-2.


RESULTS
t[SARS+] of HP was 47 days [interquartile range (IR)=25-95] and 12 HP (19%) were still positive by the end of the follow-up. In our cohort, four HP died while still shedding SARS-CoV-2 [t[SARS+]=47 days (IR=33.5-86)]. Different oncological diagnoses did not influence t[SARS+]. HP under steroids had a significantly longer average t[SARS+] (108 days vs. 45 days; p=0.016). HP with B cell depletion/T cell depletion and leukopenia were found to require more time to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 (p Logrank <0.05). Vaccinated HP had a significantly shorter duration of viral shedding (vaccinated 35.5 days vs. not vaccinated 86 days; p Logrank <0.01).


CONCLUSION
Prolonged viral shedding is a common occurrence in HP. Our data illustrate that HP under immune suppression show a significantly longer t[SARS+]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vaccination influences the length of viral shedding.">

Here, we show the strong association of protective cellular immunity with mild COVID-19 and unique cell types against SARS-CoV-2 virus in an HLA-A2 restricted manner. ELISpot assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mild COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in severe patients, whereas neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly correlate with disease severity. Single-cell analyses of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, which recognize highly conserved immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, demonstrate divergent profiles in unvaccinated patients with mild versus severe disease. CD8+ T-cell types including cytotoxic KLRB1+ CD8αα cells with innate-like T-cell signatures, IFNGhiID3hi memory cells and IL7R+ proliferative stem cell-like memory cells are preferentially observed in mild COVID-19, whereas distinct terminally-differentiated T-cell subsets are predominantly detected in severe COVID-19: highly activated FASLhi T-cell subsets and early-terminated or dysfunctional IL4R+ GATA3+ stem cell-like memory T-cell subset.

        <tr id="The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor antibodies as a therapeutic agent to combat severe COVID-19. Given the constant evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, the study aims to assess the potential of these inhibitors in adapting to new challenges and improving treatment outcomes. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was conducted using electronic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The study analyzed the role of IL-6 inhibitors in combating SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their therapeutic potential in treating severe COVID-19 cases, particularly in controlling the overshooting immune response associated with cytokine storms. IL-6 inhibitors proved to be versatile and effective in attenuating severe immune responses, especially cytokine storms, which are common in advanced COVID-19 cases. The literature emphasizes their ability to regulate the immune system, reduce disease severity, and improve patient outcomes. Their efficacy in controlling the immune response and reducing disease severity makes IL-6 inhibitor antibodies a promising therapeutic strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants. Further research is needed to optimize their use and adaptability in evolving clinical scenarios.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 since 2019 caused substantial global morbidity and mortality and continues to burden healthcare systems worldwide. Public health measures implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread also reduced circulation of other seasonal respiratory viruses, likely causing gaps in population-level immunity. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may dampen immune responses against other pathogens is highly debated and not well understood.Figure 1. VirScan analyses of serum samples pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A) VirScan total epitope hits and geometric mean (gMean) of epitope binding (EB) scores for SARS-CoV-2 pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (B) gMean of EB scores for select pathogens pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Timepoints included in the VirScan analyses were between 15-174 days prior to and 31-155 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gray lines denote paired samples for individual subjects. Statistically significant adjusted p values of < 0.05 were determined using paired t test with Holm correction. Methods In 2022, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunocompetent adults ( > 18 years) with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination history and increased risk of social or occupational exposure to respiratory viruses. Subjects were followed for 6 months and weekly symptom surveys, blood samples at enrollment, 3 and 6 months post-enrollment, and nasal swabs at report of symptoms were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR (OpenArray) for 27 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Serum antibodies were assessed by VirScan PhIP-seq for specificity to a broad library of antigen epitopes for clinically relevant pathogens, measuring total epitope hits and epitope binding (EB) scores, a measure similar to antibody titer. Results Of 43 subjects with paired serum samples > 1 week prior to and > 28 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 subjects with viral load < Ct 22.2 were assessed by VirScan. SARS-CoV-2 epitope hits and EB scores were significantly increased post-infection compared to pre-infection (Fig 1A). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with reduced EB scores for adenovirus D and S. aureus (Fig 1B). However, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with a statistically significant decline of epitope hits or EB scores for most other clinically relevant pathogens. Conclusion We assessed broad changes in the antibody repertoires of subjects prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinically relevant pathogens at the epitope level by VirScan. Together these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with differential patterns of antibody repertoire kinetics for most non-coronavirus respiratory pathogens in immunocompetent adults. Further analyses in larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Disclosures Michael J.

        <tr id="Introduction The innate immune response is an important first checkpoint in the evolution of an infection. Although adaptive immunity is generally considered the immune component that retains antigenic memory, innate immune responses can also be affected by previous stimulations. This study evaluated the impact of vaccination on innate cell activation by TLR7/8 agonist R848, as well as seasonal variations. Methods To this end, blood samples from a cohort of 304 food and retail workers from the Quebec City region were collected during three visits at 12-week intervals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated during the first and third visits and were stimulated with R848 to assess the innate immune response. Results Our results show that IL-8 production after stimulation decreased after vaccination. In addition, the IL-8 response was significantly different depending on the season when the visit occurred, for both COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Discussion This study highlights that innate immune responses can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and fluctuate seasonally.">

This tissue is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and following injury, the airway epithelium undergoes repair to restore barrier function. Though components of SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike glycoprotein essential in viral entry, have been shown to alter biological functions in various tissues, it is unclear how SARS-CoV-2 can impact airway epithelial functions, such as wound repair.In this study, 16HBE14o- epithelial monolayer cultures were treated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 subunit at 4 μg·mL−1or transfected with a plasmid expressing full-length spike glycoprotein. Secreted inflammatory mediators, markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest, culture proliferation, and wound closure measurements following mechanical injury were assessed.Spike treatment and transfection altered measures of culture proliferation and markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest. Secreted interleukin-6 but not interleukin-8 were significantly higher with spike S1 treatment, while both were significantly elevated with spike transfection. Wound closure was inhibited by both spike treatment and transfection, with significant reductions compared to control.SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 treatment and transfection can alter measures of proliferation, inflammation, and impair wound closure of 16HBE14o- airway epithelial cells. These results highlight how components of SARS-CoV-2 can impair functions of the airway epithelium independent of viral replication.">

        <tr id="Bipolar disorder (BD) is increasingly recognized as a disorder with both mitochondrial dysfunction and heightened inflammatory reactivity, yet their contribution to neuronal activity remains unclear. To address these gaps, this study utilizes iPSC-derived cerebral organoids (COs) from BD patients and healthy controls to model disease-specific metabolic and inflammatory dysfunction in a physiologically relevant system. BD COs exhibited mitochondrial impairment, dysregulated metabolic function, and increased nod-leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation sensitivity. Treatment with MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, effectively rescued mitochondrial function and reduced inflammatory activation in both BD and control COs. Additionally, a Bioactive Flavonoid Extract (BFE) was explored as a potential therapeutic, demonstrating partial rescue of inflammasome activation. These findings highlight a mitochondria-inflammasome axis in BD pathophysiology and establish a novel platform for studying BD-associated cellular mechanisms, ultimately bridging the gap between molecular dysfunction and therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a significant challenge since the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared as an outbreak in March 2020, marked by diverse symptoms and prolonged duration of disease. Defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting or emerging for at least two months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection without an alternative cause, its prevalence varies globally, with estimates of 10–20% in Europe, 7.3% in the USA, and 3.0% in the UK. The condition’s etiology remains unclear, involving factors, such as renin–angiotensin system overactivation, persistent viral reservoirs, immune dysregulation, and autoantibodies. Reactivated viruses, like EBV and HSV-6, alongside epigenetic alterations, exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance. Emerging evidence links SARS-CoV-2 to chromatin and gut microbiome changes, further influencing long-term health impacts. Diagnosis of long COVID requires detailed systemic evaluation through medical history and physical examination. Management is highly individualized, focusing mainly on the patient’s symptoms and affected systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating diverse perspectives to address systemic manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Enhanced understanding of long COVID’s pathophysiology and clinical features is critical to improving patient outcomes and quality of life. With a growing number of cases expected globally, advancing research and disseminating knowledge on long COVID remain vital for developing effective diagnostic and management frameworks, ultimately supporting better care for affected individuals.">

This study investigates the epitope specificity, T cell receptor (TCR) usage, and phenotypic changes in SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells over time in convalescent individuals with COVID-19.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 28 unvaccinated individuals with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (6 identified as the D614G variant, clade 20C) and analyzed up to 12 months post-symptom onset. Antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using specific dextramer and antibody reagents. TCR clonotypes and activation markers were characterized to explore T cell dynamics.SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited waning frequencies long-term, transitioning from memory-like to a naïve-like state. scRNAseq revealed specificity against both spike and non-spike antigens with increased CD95 and CD127 expression over time, indicating that naïve-like T cells may represent stem cell memory T cells, which are multipotent and self-renewing, likely important for long-lived immunity. TCR clonal expansion was observed mainly in memory T cells, with overlapping TCR beta chain (TRB)-complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences between participants, suggesting shared public TCR epitope-specific repertoires against SARS-CoV-2. Further, unique spike-specific CD4+ T cells with high CD95 and CD127 expression were identified, which may play a crucial role in long-term protection.This study highlights epitope-specificity heterogeneity, with some immunodominant responses, and suggests a potential role for long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. Shared TCR repertoires offers insights into cross-reactive and protective T cell clones, providing valuable information for optimizing vaccine strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings underscore the critical role of cellular immunity in long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and emphasizes the importance of understanding T cell dynamics.">

Opportunistic infections due to impaired immune function are a major cause of patient mortality. Mitochondrial dysfunction within the liver is a well-recognised feature of ARLD and sAH. However, whether these hepatic mitochondrial defects extend to the immune system of sAH patients, underlying their immune dysfunction, remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that sAH monocytes exhibit an increased content of inefficient, dysfunctional mitochondria. These changes were underpinned by abnormal mitochondrial cristae ultrastructure, which were associated with depletion of cristae structural proteins and alterations in cardiolipin profiles. Overall, our study uncovers novel structural and functional mitochondrial defects, which likely contribute to impaired monocyte immune function in sAH.">

SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected K18-hACE2 mice, overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor, exhibited 100% mortality by 10 days post infection. Regorafenib treatment significantly improved survival rates, approximately 43% remaining alive. Mechanistically, regorafenib effectively suppressed type I and II interferon and cytokine signaling.

        <tr id="Systemic inflammation is associated with COVID-19 mortality rates, but the impact of inflammation on neutralizing antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on outcomes is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the association between neutralizing antibody responses, inflammation, and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Two hundred and eight patients presenting to the ED with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were included. Neutralization was assessed using the architect angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) binding inhibition assay, and inflammation was assessed using C reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Medical records were examined for 30-day mortality and 10-day intubation. Correlation between biomarkers was assessed and Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for outcomes. Thirty-seven (18%) patients died and 59 (28%) required intubation. There was a correlation between IL-6 and CRP (r = 0.34) but not ACE-2 (r < 0.06). Patients that died had higher CRP (14 mg/dl, 8-21) than those that survived (5 mg/dl, 2-11) and IL-6 (died = 344 pg/ml, 138-870 vs. survived = 65 pg/ml, 28-140). ACE-2 inhibition trended higher in those who survived (18%, 0%-65%) than those who died (3%, 0%-48%). Patients with elevated IL-6, elevated CRP, or low ACE2 inhibition had higher mortality. Only IL-6 (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.52) and age (1.04, 1.01-1.08) were associated with mortality in multivariate models. Elevated IL-6 was associated with 30-day mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lower ACE-2 inhibition was not independently associated with mortality or correlated with inflammatory markers, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.IMPORTANCEWhile systemic inflammation associated with worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not associated with neutralizing antibody concentrations, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

        <tr id="The coinfection of individual cells is a requirement for exchange between two or more virus genomes, which is a major mechanism driving virus evolution. Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

        <tr id="Abstract Background People living with HIV (PLWH) face the dual challenge of human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is associated with severe outcomes and a higher risk of mortality. In January 2021, the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in India and started mass administration of two types of vaccines. The two vaccines used on a large scale were, a recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine/ ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) and whole virion inactivated vaccine/ BBV152 (Covaxin).The study of cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination in PLWH was vital for safeguarding this vulnerable population. Methods Study design: Prospective observational study Study population: The individuals recruited in the study were vaccinated with at least 2 doses and/or booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (COVISHIELD/COVAXIN). The individuals were segregated into two groups (PLWH and non-HIV-infected healthy individuals). Testing Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were cultured to test the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune response using activation induced marker/ intracellular cytokine staining (AIM/ICS) assay. Distribution of CD4 T lymphocytes count in HIV patients with mean CD4 count 470 cell/µl. Results We conducted did this study in two phases. The first phase was conducted between August 2022 and December 2022, while the second phase, or the follow-up, took place from January 2023 to December 2023. In the first phase/ first visit (V1), we recruited 50 adult PLWH and 40 adult healthy controls. Subsequently, in phase 2/follow-up/ second visit (V2), we achieved a follow-up rate of 100% in each arm. SARS-CoV2-specific cellular immune response after COVID-19 vaccination was comparable and durable IN PLWH as compared to healthy controls. Conclusion Comparable and durable immune response was observed in PLWH population on regular highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with stable viral suppression and good CD4+ T cell counts. This was consistent over time across 1 year gap in both phases of the study and across different vaccine types. This outcome indicates that the cellular immune responses in our PLWH cohort is comparable and durable to that of the general population, which is a reassuring finding for the public health.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, profoundly impacted global health systems and economies. Vaccination and diagnostic advancements were pivotal in managing the pandemic. This systematic review evaluates antibody levels in adults following complete COVID-19 vaccination and examines the prevalence of infections in vaccinated populations. A systematic review adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on studies analyzing antibody levels at least 14 days after full vaccination with FDA- or EMA-approved vaccines. Five European studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. Data were extracted and synthesized from studies involving 6280 participants aged 19 to 105, with an average of 11% having prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody levels were analyzed over time, and the incidence of post-vaccination COVID-19 cases was recorded. The reviewed studies demonstrated that antibody levels peaked shortly after vaccination but gradually declined over time. Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited higher antibody titers than those without prior exposure. After the first dose, the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine led to significantly higher antibody levels than the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, especially in those without prior infection. Across all studies, the incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals was low (0.1–3.8% for 144–302 days post-vaccination). Vaccination reduced severe outcomes despite decreasing antibody levels. The decline in new COVID-19 cases and related deaths is attributed to widespread vaccination, natural immunity, and virus mutations reducing severity. Further studies are warranted to explore antibody persistence and optimal vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and nearly 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system.Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model. (A) Experimental diagram: Eight weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitored daily for symptoms, or euthanized at 5 days post-infection (DPI) to collect tissue. (B) Daily weight measurements in K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020. (C)The survival curve showing the probability of survival over 7 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. (D) Representative mouse brain hemisphere image showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by immunohistochemical staining. Boxed regions are shown on the right. Bar: 500 µm. Methods Here using the K18-hACE2 model, we investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on major parts of neurovascular systems, and found increased incidence of microhemorrhage and significant disruption of both BBB and BCSFB in K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cerebral microvascular injury was accompanied by substantial pericyte damage, tight junction loss, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. In addition, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation occurred at both BBB and BCSFB, as shown by upregulation of VCAM-1 and COX2 markers.Figure 2: Vascular damage and BBB breakdown in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 model.

Results By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment.

        <tr id="The native microbiome influences a plethora of host processes, including neurological function. However, its impacts on diverse brain cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing on hippocampi from wildtype, germ-free mice and reveal the microbiome-dependent transcriptional landscape across all major neural cell types. We found conserved impacts on key adaptive immune and neurodegenerative transcriptional pathways, underscoring the microbiome’s contributions to disease-relevant processes. Mono-colonization with select indigenous microbes identified species-specific effects on the transcriptional state of brain myeloid cells. Colonization by Escherichia coli induced a distinct adaptive immune and neurogenerative disease-associated cell state, suggesting increased disease susceptibility. Indeed, E. coli exposure in the 5xFAD mouse model resulted in exacerbated cognitive decline and amyloid pathology, demonstrating its sufficiency to worsen Alzheimer’s disease-relevant outcomes. Together, these results emphasize the broad, species-specific, microbiome-dependent consequences on neurological transcriptional state and highlight the capacity of specific microbes to modulate disease susceptibility.

This study evaluated humoral responses in 29 MM patients and cellular responses in a subset of 19 MM patients, specific to Wuhan and Omicron spike proteins, between 16 and 26 weeks following the third vaccine dose. After 26 weeks, we highlighted a significant reduction in the neutralizing antibodies to both spikes and the percentages of IFN-γ+CD107a+ spike-specific CD8+ T cells. On the other hand, patients who underwent an additional stimulation between the two time points, through either a fourth vaccine dose or breakthrough infection, showed a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies and stable levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Additionally, those with only three doses experienced a higher rate of breakthrough infections during the 32-week follow-up period. These findings underscore the waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time and may help benefit-risk evaluation in vaccination strategies in MM patients.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is intricately related to the reprogramming of host metabolism. However, existing studies have mainly focused on peripheral blood samples and barely identified specific metabolites that are critically involved in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current small-scale study, we performed metabolic profiling in plasma (n = 61) and paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples (n = 20) using parallel two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS). In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-α production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that the levels of indoxyl sulfate could potentially serve as a functional biomarker to monitor COVID-19 disease progression and guide more individualized treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact since its emergence in late 2019. Characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death, COVID-19 has necessitated extensive research into the host-pathogen interactions that drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies. This study employed a multi-omic approach that combined direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and Illumina cDNA sequencing to investigate whole blood transcriptomic profiles in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Nanopore DRS, which provides long-read sequencing data, we were able to capture not only gene expression levels but also crucial RNA modifications, including poly(A) tail length, non-adenine residue (non-A), pseudouridylation (psU), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation. This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the impact of these RNA modifications on gene expression and function within the context of COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant alterations in gene expression patterns, poly(A) tail lengths, non-A and the prevalence of psU and m5C modifications in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. These results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between viral infection, host immune response, and RNA processing, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia.">

Recent studies have revealed an imbalance in the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-ADAMTS13 axis in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. We examined whether this imbalance contributes to RTI-mediated stroke severity. Wild-type (WT), Vwf -/-, or Adamts13-/- mice with respective littermate controls (Vwf +/+, or Adamts13+/+) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of S. aureus (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0) and subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion. In S. aureus-infected mice, infarct volumes were assessed on day 2 and functional outcomes on weeks 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. In SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, infarct volumes and functional outcomes (Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion. We demonstrated that S. aureus or SARS-CoV-2 RTI was accompanied by an imbalance in the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis and an increase in plasma levels of IL-6, CXCL1, and MCP-1, which was associated with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infection). S. aureus- or SARS-CoV-2-infected Vwf -/- mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes, while infected Adamts13-/- mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. control). In the models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF contributes to stroke severity, while ADAMTS13 is protective.">

Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="In a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals treated with the antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the virus rebounds following treatment. The mechanisms driving this rebound are not well understood. We used a mathematical model to describe the longitudinal viral load dynamics of 51 individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 20 of whom rebounded. Target cell preservation, either by a robust innate immune response or initiation of N-R near the time of symptom onset, coupled with incomplete viral clearance, appears to be the main factor leading to viral rebound. Moreover, the occurrence of viral rebound is likely influenced by the time of treatment initiation relative to the progression of the infection, with earlier treatments leading to a higher chance of rebound. A comparison with an untreated cohort suggests that early treatments with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be associated with a delay in the onset of an adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that extending the course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment to a 10-day regimen may greatly diminish the chance of rebound in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Altogether, our results suggest that in some individuals, a standard 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir starting around the time of symptom onset may not completely eliminate the virus. Thus, after treatment ends, the virus can rebound if an effective adaptive immune response has not fully developed. These findings on the role of target cell preservation and incomplete viral clearance also offer a possible explanation for viral rebounds following other antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2.


IMPORTANCE
Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In a subset of individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the initial reduction in viral load is followed by viral rebound once treatment is stopped. We show that the timing of treatment initiation with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may influence the risk of viral rebound. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir stops viral growth and preserves target cells but may not lead to full clearance of the virus. Thus, once treatment ends, if an effective adaptive immune response has not adequately developed, the remaining virus can lead to rebound. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of rebound and can help develop better treatment strategies to minimize this possibility.">

Trajectory analysis indicates bifurcating paths starting from the homeostatic state branching toward stress-response and inflammatory states. Three major functional modules: ribosomal/translation, coordinated immune cell function, and inflammatory/transcriptional regulation, showing disease-specific activation patterns were identified. Cell communication analysis further highlights sophisticated neural-immune interactions, particularly between photoreceptors and microglia.

The resolution phase of inflammation is critical for restoring tissue homeostasis following an injury. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a ubiquitous protein that plays a fundamental role in the resolution of inflammation, including in preclinical models of infectious disease. Here, we investigated the role of AnxA1 in coronavirus infection and its potential as a host-targeted therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Wild-type (WT) and AnxA1 knockout (AnxA1KO) mice were intranasally infected with the murine betacoronavirus MHV-3 to study the endogenous role of AnxA1. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses in the lungs of MHV-3-infected mice revealed increased AnxA1 expression and its cleavage, which was associated with neutrophilic infiltration (Ly6G+ cells) mainly in peribronchiolar and perivascular regions. AnxA1-deficient mice exhibited higher neutrophilic infiltration and lung damage, alongside increased CXCL1 production in the lungs, when compared to WT-infected mice. In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice, we found increased AnxA1 cleavage associated with lung inflammation. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice with the AnxA1-mimetic peptide, Ac2-26, reduced lung damage and lethality, without altering the host ability to deal with viral replication. Notably, Ac2-26-treated mice exhibited similar levels of protection to that afforded by the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight the protective role of the endogenous AnxA1 in mitigating coronavirus-induced lung inflammation and underscore the therapeutic potential of AnxA1 mimetic Ac2-26 as a host-targeted therapy against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory tract and lungs; however, the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can also involve the central nervous system. The pathomechanisms underlying neurological impairments in COVID-19 and post COVID-19 condition remain incompletely understood, hence experimental studies under defined conditions, in a suitable animal model, can help to clarify the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. The K18-hACE2 mouse represents such a model, as intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 VOC generally results in widespread neuronal infection with limited tissue response in the brain, consistent with a mild non-suppurative (meningo)encephalitis, with microgliosis, astrogliosis and (peri)vascular leukocyte infiltrates but no evidence of infection of vessel structures. The present study used this model to address the hypothesis that the vascular reaction is secondary to the neuronal infection. It confirmed that in intranasally challenged K18-hACE2 mice the virus targeted the neurons without overt neuropathic effect, whilst sparing the blood vessels, and further characterised the resulting inflammatory response in the brain in situ and through bulk RNA sequencing. The former highlighted the recruitment of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) via postcapillary venules, with their accumulation in the perivascular space and occasional emigration into the neuroparenchyma, without targeting and/or damage to the vessel wall. At the transcriptome level, this was accompanied by positive enrichment of pathways and the upregulation of genes involved in both the inflammatory reaction and the recruitment (including adhesion and migration) and activity of the leukocytes. We also found morphological and molecular evidence of subtle impairment of blood-brain barrier function, i.e. increased permeability. The results obtained from the model indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the neurons induces neuroinflammation, with leukocyte recruitment and activation as well as blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These data can help to understand more fully the reaction of the CNS in COVID-19 patients, and neurotropic virus infections in general.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still poorly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) in modulating the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that overexpression of TLR10 in A549 lung epithelial cells, immunostimulated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins S and N mainly downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and interferons and affected gene expression in the cocultured THP-1 monocytes. Our results suggest that TLR10 could mediate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection by downregulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL10, IL6, IL8, and IFNβ. Modulation of TLR10 expression could have implications for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, in whom excessive inflammation leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a key feature. However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of modulating TLR10 expression on the antiviral response and the overall balance of the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Excess NETs is linked to inflammatory and thrombotic complications observed in COVID-19.To explore the impact of NETs and macrophage activation on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who developed complications.We included 30 patients from the first (March 2020) and 30 from the second wave (July 2021), collecting two plasma samples at diagnosis and seven days later. Data on demographics, comorbidities, and basic analytical data were compiled. NETs markers (myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), p-selectin (P-SEL) and S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer (MRP)) and macrophage activation markers (Chitotriosidase activity (ChT), CCL18/PARC and YKL-40) were measured.The first wave had higher incidences of post-COVID syndrome, ICU admissions, and mortality. Patients of each wave showed elevated blood cells, liver enzymes, and coagulation markers at the time of diagnosis, with fibrinogen and D-Dimer differing between waves. NET and macrophage markers, NE, MPO, MRP, DNAse, ChT, and CCL18 were elevated, while P-SEL, cfDNA, and YKL-40 were decreased if compared to controls. A decrease in NE and DNAse is a link to lower levels of these two markers in complications versus without complications.This study emonstrates alterations in NETs and macrophage activation markers in COVID-19 patients, indicating an imbalance in inflammatory response regulation.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelination and neuroinflammation, with oxidative stress playing a pivotal role in lesion pathology. This study aimed to investigate the differential cellular responses to myelin debris under varying oxidative states. Myelin oxidation was induced using a Cu–peroxide system, confirmed by elevated TBARS levels and autofluorescence. BV-2 microglia viability remained unaffected by myelin exposure. However, oxidized myelin significantly altered oxidative stress markers, autophagy, and iron metabolism, as evidenced by changes in Sod2, Tfr1, p62, and P-Erk/Erk ratios. Morphological analyses revealed time- and dose-dependent differences in myelin processing, with oxidized myelin leading to distinct phagosome dynamics. Complementary studies using induced microglia-like cells (iMG)—a primary cell culture—confirmed the feasibility of employing oxidized microglia to study microglia activity. The use of iMGs provides a model closer to patient physiology, offering the potential to evaluate individual cellular responses to oxidative damage. This approach could be instrumental in identifying personalized therapeutic strategies by assessing patient-specific microglial behavior in response to myelin debris. These findings highlight the impact of myelin oxidative status on microglial function, advancing the understanding of oxidative stress in MS and paving the way for personalized medicine applications in neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Persistent symptoms after COVID-19 constitute the long COVID syndrome, also called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). COVID-19 vaccines reduce the gravity of ensuing SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, whether vaccines also have an impact on PASC remain unknown. We investigated whether vaccination prior to infection alters the subsequent neurologic post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC). We studied prospectively the first consecutive 200 post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and 1100 non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients evaluated at our neuro-COVID-19 clinic between May 2020 and January 2023. Among PNP patients, 87% had a pre-vaccination infection and 13% had a breakthrough infection post-vaccination. Among the NNP patients, 70.7% had a pre-vaccination infection and 29.3% had a breakthrough infection. Both PNP and NNP breakthrough infection patients had more frequent pre-existing depression/anxiety than their respective pre-vaccination infection groups, and NNP breakthrough infection patients also had more frequent comorbidities of headache, lung and gastrointestinal diseases than the NNP pre-vaccination infection group. An average of 10 months after symptom onset, the three most common neurological symptoms for PNP patients were brain fog (86.5%), numbness/tingling (56.5%) and headache (56.5%). Of all Neuro-PASC symptoms, PNP breakthrough infection more frequently reported anosmia compared to PNP pre-vaccination infection patients (69.2 versus 37.9%; P = 0.005). For NNP patients, the three most common neurological symptoms were brain fog (83.9%), headache (70.9%) and dizziness (53.8%). NNP pre-vaccination infection reported anosmia (56.6 versus 39.1%; P < 0.0001) and dysgeusia (53.3 versus 37.3%; P < 0.0001) more frequently than breakthrough infection patients. NNP breakthrough infection more frequently reported dizziness compared to NNP pre-vaccination infection patients (61.5 versus 50.6%; P = 0.001). Both PNP and NNP patients had impaired quality-of-life in cognitive, fatigue, sleep, anxiety and depression domains with no differences between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups. PNP patients performed worse on National Institutes of Health Toolbox tests of processing speed, attention, executive function and working memory than a US normative population whereas NNP patients had lower results in processing, speed, attention and working memory, without differences between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups. These results indicate that vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection does not affect the neurologic manifestations of long COVID in either PNP or NNP patients. Minor differences in neurologic symptoms between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 strains evolution. Patients developing Neuro-PASC after breakthrough infection have a higher burden of comorbidities, highlighting different risk factors warranting targeted management.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Methods We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC. Results COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors. Discussion The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many common symptoms in post-acute sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined symptoms and performance of the PASC score, developed in the general population, in MS based on infection history.


METHODS
We surveyed North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry participants regarding infections and categorized participants based on infection history. Symptoms experienced before, during, and after infection were used to identify persistent new symptoms. PASC was defined as a score ⩾ 12 based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study RECOVER.


RESULTS
Of 4787 participants surveyed, 2927 were included: 294 (10%) having recent COVID-19; 853 (29.1%) recent non-COVID-19 infection; 246 (8.4%) recent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection; 1534 (52.4%) uninfected, defined as never having COVID-19 nor any infection within the past 6 months. Compared to those uninfected, infection groups reported at least a two-fold increase in fever, cough, loss of smell/taste, and shortness of breath. Based on persistent new symptoms, PASC was identified in only 1.5% of participants with COVID-19.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests lower than expected prevalence of PASC in MS and a complex association between infections and development of new persistent symptoms following infections. The similar proportions classified with PASC across infection groups shows that symptoms of PASC are common and complicate assessment of PASC in MS.">

 Background:
 Preceding respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by bacteria or viruses are associated with worse stroke outcomes, likely due to an exaggerated inflammatory immune response, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and coagulopathy. Recent studies have revealed increased plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity (the risk factors for stroke) in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis plays a causative role in the pathophysiology of
 S. aureus
 - or COVID-19-associated stroke severity or is merely an associative marker of disease status.


 Objective:
 To examine whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis is a causal link between RTIs and stroke severity.


 Methods:
 Wild-type (WT) mice (3–4 months old) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of
 S. aureus
 (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0). On day 6 (
 S. aureus
 ) or day 3 (SARS-CoV-2), the infection was confirmed to be localized in the lungs (but not in the brain) and the plasma VWF levels and ADTMTS13 activity were quantified. In another set of experiments, WT,
 Vwf
 −/−
 , and
 Adamts13
 −/−
 mice (3–4 months old) with respective littermate controls were subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia (filament stroke model) followed by reperfusion. For the
 S. aureus
 experiments, brain infarcts were assessed on day 2 post-reperfusion and functional outcomes (corner test, wire hanging test, modified neurological severity score, and rotarod test) on week 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. For the SARS-CoV-2 experiments, brain infarcts and functional outcomes (the Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion.


 Result:
 We demonstrated that
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2 infection localized to the lungs in the WT mice resulted in increased (2–3 fold) plasma VWF levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity, concomitant with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infected mice) up to day 28 post-reperfusion.
 S. aureus
 - or SARS-CoV-2-infected VWF-deficient mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Vwf
 +/+

 ). In contrast,
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2-infected ADAMTS13-deficient mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Adamts13
 +/+

 ).


 Conclusion:
 In the experimental models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF plays a causal role in worsening stroke outcomes, while ADAMTS13 is protective.

        <tr id="The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alarmed the global community due to the significant loss of human lives during the pandemic. However, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. A positive aspect of this recent pandemic has been that it stimulated scientists to create vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, accelerating the emergence of new therapeutic agents based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Numerous mRNA therapeutic products are currently in development, with dozens at various clinical trial stages. These products have facilitated significant changes in the paradigm of medical therapy, including the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although most of these cardiovascular mRNA therapeutics are still in preclinical development, phase IIa trials for myocardial ischemia therapy have already been completed with encouraging results. The scope of mRNA therapy for CVD is extremely broad, potentially even limitless, with ongoing research including conditions like myocardial ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia, and occlusive arterial diseases. Moreover, mRNA can be used to enhance the effectiveness of cell therapies. In the future, researchers predict that mRNA therapies will not only replace some existing biopharmaceuticals and pharmacotherapy methods but also be applied to treat previously considered untreatable cardiovascular diseases.">

The study included 81 patients diagnosed with long COVID, the presence of which was determined by the persistence of a complex of multidirectional symptoms for more than 12 weeks that developed during or after COVID-19. Flow cytometry was used to assess lymphocyte subsets. The main lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed: T cells, cytotoxic T cells, B cells, NK and NKT cells in blood plasma via multiplex xMAP analysis. Also concentrations of GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, MIP-1b, TNF were measured. The content of proinflammatory cytokines and some immune system cells was characterized in respondents with long COVID. A comparative analysis of data was conducted with individuals without a history of COVID-19, as well as between patients with different numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases.Results and discussion. The study identified characteristic features of long COVID that affect both the nervous and immune systems.Analysis of the blood cells revealed absolute and relative lymphopenia due to a decrease in NK cells. We also noticed an increased number of NKT cells in patients who suffered multiple COVID-19, when compared to those who only were infected with SARS-CoV-2 once. Cytokine analysis revealed increase in concentrations of IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17 and CCL2/MCP1 in blood plasma of long COVID patients.Conclusion.

        <tr id="Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis strongly correlates with neuroinflammation. Peripheral monocytes are crucial components of the human immune system that may play a role in neuroinflammation, but their contribution to AD pathogenesis is largely understudied partially due to the lack of appropriate human models. Here, we present human cortical organoid microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) for modeling dynamic AD neuroinflammation mediated by monocytes. By incorporating 3D printed devices into an existing cortical organoid protocol, 96 hCO-MPSs can be established with significantly reduced necrosis and hypoxia as well as enhanced viability within a commonly used 96 well plate, and each hCO-MPS consists of a doughnut-shaped hCO and a 3D printed device per well. Using this approach, monocytes from AD patients exhibit higher infiltration, decreased amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance, and stronger inflammatory responses compared to monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis were observed to be induced by AD monocytes. Furthermore, the significant increase in the expression of IL1B and CCL3, both at the transcriptional and protein levels, indicated the pivotal role of these cytokine and chemokine in monocyte-mediated AD neuroinflammation. Our findings provide insight for understanding monocytes’ role in AD pathogenesis, and the user-friendly MPS models we present are compatible with existing laboratory settings, highlighting their potential for modeling neuroinflammation and developing new therapeutics for various neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to an emerging health challenge known as long COVID, also known as PASC, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, characterized by symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of infection. While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Enteroviruses cause nearly 1 billion global infections annually and are associated with a diverse array of human illnesses. Among these, myocarditis and the resulting chronic inflammation have been recognized as major contributing factors to virus-induced heart failure. Despite our growing understanding, very limited therapeutic strategies have been developed to address the pathological consequences of virus-induced chronic innate immune activation. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was used as a model cardiotropic enterovirus. We leveraged in vitro cell-based studies to investigate cardiomyocyte and macrophage interaction during CVB3 infection, as well as animal studies and unique human cardio specimens to evaluate mechanisms of viral heart injury. We present evidence that viral myocarditis is in part exacerbated by pathological activation of the complement pathway in cells, mice, and human cardiac tissues. We demonstrate unique cell type-specific responses to viral infection that are exacerbated by mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in macrophages. Macrophages are robustly activated by damage-associated mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial proteins and lipid extracts. Mechanistically, we identify complement protective factors CD59/protectin and CD55/DAF as novel targets of viral proteinase that acts to release the brakes on complement-mediated autoinjury. Collectively, our study highlights a novel mechanism that can act as a potential contributor to CVB3 pathogenesis through mitochondrial injury-mediated autoimmunity. IMPORTANCE This study sheds light on how enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus B3, may contribute to heart failure by triggering harmful immune responses in the heart. We discovered that viral infections in heart cells cause mitochondrial damage, which in turn activates a destructive immune response involving the complement system. This immune activation is one of the significant contributors that lead to further injury of heart tissues, worsening the damage caused by the virus. Additionally, we identified key protective molecules that are targeted and disrupted by the virus, allowing the immune system to attack the heart even more aggressively. Understanding these mechanisms may provide additional insights into how viral infections can lead to chronic heart conditions and suggests potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce heart damage in patients affected by viral myocarditis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background COVID‐19 has been associated with both respiratory (diaphragm) and non‐respiratory (limb) muscle atrophy. It is unclear if SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of skeletal muscle plays a role in these changes. This study sought to: 1) determine if cells comprising skeletal muscle tissue, particularly myofibres, express the molecular components required for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; 2) assess the capacity for direct SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and its impact on atrophy pathway genes in myogenic cells; and 3) in an animal model of COVID‐19, examine the relationship between viral infection of skeletal muscle and myofibre atrophy within the diaphragm and limb muscles. Methods We used in silico bioinformatics analysis of published human single cell RNA‐seq datasets, as well as direct qPCR examination of human myotubes and diaphragm biopsies, to assess expression of key genes involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 cellular entry. In Vitro, we determined the ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 to directly infect myogenic cells and employed qPCR to assess the impact on muscle atrophy pathway genes (ubiquitin‐proteasome, autophagy). In vivo, the diaphragm and quadriceps of Roborovski hamsters with SARS‐CoV‐2 respiratory infection were examined at day 3 post‐inoculation to evaluate the relationship between atrophy pathway and SARS‐CoV‐2 transcripts by qPCR, as well as histological measurements of myofibre morphology. Results Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as cooperating proteases (furin, cathepsins B and L), are expressed by myofibres. ACE2 expression was increased 5‐fold (p = 0.01) in the diaphragms of mechanically ventilated human subjects compared to controls. In Vitro, a time‐dependent increase of SARS‐CoV‐2 transcript levels was observed in myotubes directly exposed to the virus (p = 0.002). This was associated with downregulation of the ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (by 64%, p = 0.002) and the autophagy gene LC3B (by 31%, p = 0.009). In contrast, in vivo infection led to upregulation of MuRF1 in quadriceps (23‐fold, p = 0.0007) and autophagy genes in both quadriceps (5.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 7‐fold for p62, p = 0.0002) and diaphragm (2.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 2.3‐fold for p62, p = 0.057). In infected hamsters the diaphragm lacked viral transcripts but exhibited atrophy (48% decrease in myofibre area; p = 0.02), whereas the quadriceps lacked myofibre atrophy despite elevated viral transcripts in the muscle. Conclusions Although myogenic cells express the genes required for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and can be directly infected, there was no evident relationship between viral transcript levels and manifestations of atrophy, either in vitro or in vivo. Our results do not support direct myofibre infection by SARS‐CoV‐2 as a likely cause of atrophy in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background: This study assessed the long-term dynamics of neutralizing antibodies in a Ugandan cohort primarily exposed to the A.23.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant, examining how this shaped immune breadth and potency against diverse strains following infection and prototype-based vaccination. Methods: We conducted a 427-day retrospective analysis of 41 participants across multiple SARS-CoV-2 waves, assessing binding and neutralizing antibody responses using in-house ELISA and pseudotyped virus neutralization assays. We quantified immune responses to key SARS-CoV-2 variants, A.23.1, D614G, Delta, and BA.4, capturing evolving immunity across the pandemic. Results: Neutralizing antibody titers against A.23.1 remained significantly higher than those against D614G, Delta, and BA.4, highlighting the solid immune memory following A.23.1 infection. Consistently lower titers were observed for BA.4 across all time points, aligning with its strong immune-evasion capability. Correlations between neutralizing titers and spike-directed IgG (S-IgG) concentrations were significantly stronger for A.23.1 than for D614G, with no correlation for BA.4. ChAdOx1-S vaccination substantially elevated the neutralizing titers across all variants, most notably BA.4, highlighting the essential role of vaccination in boosting immunity, even in individuals with initially low titers. Conclusions: Initial exposure to the A.23.1 variant triggered potent immune responses, shaping neutralizing antibody dynamics during subsequent exposures. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for early viral exposures in vaccine development and public health planning. The distinctly lower immune response to BA.4 highlights the need for continuous antigenic monitoring and timely vaccine updates for protection against emerging variants. Vaccination remains essential for reinforcing and sustaining immunity against evolving variants.">

        <tr id="T-cell-mediated immunity is essential for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection, preventing severe disease, and potentially reducing the risk of long-term coronavirus disease (COVID). This study investigated the impact of natural infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity on T-cell responses, with a particular emphasis on the role of memory T-cells in long-term COVID-19. The present study reviewed current literature on T-cell responses, including memory T-cell development, in individuals with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, those vaccinated with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and those with hybrid immunity. It examined studies that compared T-cell activity, immune regulation, and the prevalence of long-term COVID-19 across these groups. Natural infection induces variable T-cell responses, with severe cases showing stronger but sometimes dysregulated immunological activity, which may contribute to prolonged COVID-19. Vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines, elicits targeted and consistent T-cell responses, including memory T-cells, reducing disease severity, and the incidence of long-term COVID-19. Hybrid immunity combines natural infection and vaccination, provides the most robust protection, enhanceds memory T-cell responses, and reduces the risk of long-term COVID-19 through balanced immune regulation. Memory T-cells play a critical role in mitigating long-term COVID-19. Vaccination significantly enhances T-cell-mediated immunity, minimizing the risk of chronic symptoms compared to natural infection alone. Hybrid immunity provides the most effective defense, emphasizing the importance of vaccination, even after natural infection, to prevent long-term COVID-19.">

Here we studied the magnitude and functional characteristics of vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the full vaccination protocol, and the recall response after a third booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and compared them to those of people without diabetes. We found defects in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory maintenance and the functionality of the vaccine specific T cells in people with diabetes compared to people without. In those individuals with diabetes that harbored detectable vaccine-specific T cells, they displayed an unfocused, tolerogenic phenotype characterized by increased expression of IL-13 and IL-10 in T1D and T2D compared to people without diabetes.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT MAIT cells are one of the largest unconventional T cell populations and, recruited to the site of infection, play both protective and pathogenic roles during pulmonary viral infections. MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

Recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 are primarily characterized
by endotheliitis (or endothelialitis), whose severity is related to the pre-existing or current damage to
the complex structure that lines the surface of the vascular endothelium, most notably the glycocalyx.
Such damage results in the loss of many endothelial cell functions. To restore these functions, the
cell must repair the glycocalyx that covers it. However, this is not always possible, especially when
the repair capacity of such an exo-endo-cytoplasmic cell structure is limited due to cellular senescence.
If the gene repair system remains activated, the damaged glycocalyx can be reconstituted via
specific transcriptional pathways in response to oxidative and reductive stresses. Despite the experimental
evidence in favour of this hypothesis, many of the recently published reviewrs on long
COVID do not mention the use of therapeutic treatments via specific 'oxidative eustress'. In fact,
mild and controlled oxidative stress is able to induce an activating response to cellular damage repair
processes. This perspective aims to draw the attention of researchers to these aspects in an attempt to
address this gap in understanding.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Although recommended isolation periods for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been shortened as the pandemic has subsided, prolonged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding remains common in immunocompromised patients. This study estimated the probability of viral clearance in these patients based on elapsed days and specific risk factors.


METHODS
We prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from January 2022 to May 2023 during the Omicron variant era. We collected weekly respiratory specimens for viral load measurement and culture. We identified significant predictors of viral culture negative conversion through univariate and multivariate analyses and estimated viral clearance probabilities using a Cox time-varying proportional hazard model.


RESULTS
Among 70 patients with serial 319 respiratory specimens with positive SARS-CoV-2 genomic polymerase chain reaction results that underwent cell culture, ∼69% (48) had haematologic malignancies and 31% (22) underwent solid organ transplants. B-cell depleting agents and viral copy number significantly influenced viral culture negative conversion. The probability of culture-negative conversion for immunocompromised patients not treated with B-cell-depleting agents increased over time, with over 90% achieving negative conversion by Day 84. Patients treated with B-cell depleting agents showed lower conversion rates. By Day 84, <90% of patients with cycle threshold values 23-28 [4.85-6.35 log copies/mL] achieved culture-negative conversion. The results indicate more prolonged shedding than in patients without B-cell depletion.


CONCLUSION
Estimating SARS-CoV-2 clearance probabilities based on specific risk factors can guide individualised isolation decisions for immunocompromised patients, tailoring policies to each patient's delayed viral clearance risk.">

        <tr id="Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of pathophysiological conditions linked to the disruption of metabolic processes associated with energy storage and consumption. Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are currently diagnosed with MetS. Patients with MetS experience higher mortality rates following SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibit poor vaccine efficacy following influenza virus vaccination compared to metabolically healthy individuals. However, the specific impact of MetS on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination has not been widely studied. To address this gap, we utilized high-fat diet feeding to establish a murine model of MetS, in which mice exhibit the same diagnostic criteria for MetS as human patients. We then used high-fat diet-induced MetS mice and regular chow diet-fed wild-type mice to analyze immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we monitored mice for disease severity, measured levels of virally induced inflammation, and quantified viral titers in various tissues. Our results indicate that MetS mice exhibit accelerated mortality post-infection, accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokine transcripts at sites of infection. Additionally, MetS alters the degree of viral replication across various tissues. Furthermore, our vaccination studies revealed that MetS reduces the potency of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Delta variant. Overall, our findings suggest that MetS exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and diminishes vaccine efficacy, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to protect individuals with MetS from severe outcomes following infection and vaccination. Impact This study represents the first detailed account of the failure to generate protective neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mice with metabolic syndrome (MetS) following vaccination. The insights gained from this research inform future vaccine design and aid in identifying individuals at greater risk of breakthrough infections. By specifically isolating the risk associated with MetS, rather than obesity alone, these findings lay the groundwork for future investigations aimed at enhancing immune responses in individuals with MetS. This work is highly relevant to a broad audience, as it addresses a critical unmet need in vaccine development and provides essential guidance for the rational design of vaccines to protect vulnerable populations affected by MetS.">

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic and devastating health crisis. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and the exaggerated immune response resulting from infection with this disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Activation may have a contribution to disease severity.A case study was carried out in order to find the association between COVID-19, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2. The effect of age, sex, smoking, diabetic and hypertention on the level of the studied cytokines were evaluated. Inaddition, the influnce of COVID-19 severity on TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2 levels were studied. Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies guidelines recommend the use of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for patients with SARS-CoV-2 at high risk of disease progression, including those who are immunocompromised. We hypothesized that conventional plasma units have comparable neutralizing antibody levels to CCP.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
Conventional plasma and CCP units were obtained from blood suppliers. Quantitatively measured antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were assessed using the MesoScale Discovery multiplex electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Binding antibody distributions were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were analyzed using the GeneScript ELISA-based neutralization assay. The proportion of conventional and CCP units with a percent signal inhibition of ≥80% (as defined by the United States Food and Drug Administration for CCP in 2021) and exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.


RESULTS
Among 218 conventional plasma units and 74 CCP units collected between September 2023 and July 2024, the distribution of total antibody binding levels largely overlapped between conventional plasma and CCP, though statistically significant differences in median nucleocapsid and spike Omicron variant concentrations were observed. Median percent signal neutralization was 97.5% (range 3.4%-98.6%) among conventional plasma units and 97.7% (range 95.4%-98.6%) among CCP units. For conventional plasma, 95.0% (95% CI = 91.2%-97.5%) met the neutralization antibody threshold for high-titer CCP. For CCP, 100% (95% CI = 95.1%-100.0%) met the neutralization threshold for high-titer CCP.


CONCLUSION
Conventional plasma units demonstrate similar median antibody concentration to CCP units. In countries or regions where licensed CCP is unavailable and titers are unknown, transfusion of multiple conventional plasma units may be of clinical utility.">

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cause significant dysfunction among people living with HIV. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe condition often seen in intensive care unit patients. Due to limited treatment options, ALI is linked to high rates of mortality and morbidity. Bacterial and viral infections are significant contributors to ALI. For instance, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to a strong inflammatory response that may progress to ALI, a leading cause of death in COVID-19 cases. Prior research has demonstrated that sulfonamides and sydnones exhibit anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, which has led us to develop compounds containing both scaffolds. Most of the new sulfonamide-sydnone hybrids are expected to be orally bioavailable based on in silico ADME predictions. They effectively suppressed the development of ALI in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice and inhibited viral replication in Calu-3 cells, with minimal cytotoxicity in non-infected Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells. Molecular docking investigations indicated some possible viral targets for the action of the sydnones, highlighting the possible interaction with non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, combined experimental and theoretical studies indicated that the new compounds can strongly interact with human serum albumin, suggesting a possible extended residence time in the human bloodstream.">

        <tr id="Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of treatment options have been evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials, with several being approved for use in humans. Immunomodulatory drugs have shown success in dampening the deleterious inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 patients, but there remains an urgent need for development of additional therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. A potential drug target is the CCR5-CCL5 axis, and blocking this pathway may protect against severe disease. Here we evaluated whether OB-002, an analog of human CCL5 and a potent antagonist of CCR5, provides therapeutic benefit in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Daily treatment with OB-002 altered immune gene transcription in the lungs, and reduced pathology following infection, but did not prevent weight loss or viral replication in the lungs of infected animals, even in combination with the antiviral drug remdesivir. Our data suggest that targeting the CCR5-CCL5 pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters is insufficient to significantly impact disease development in this model.">

        <tr id="Single-cell studies have revealed that intestinal macrophages maintain gut homeostasis through the balanced actions of reactive (inflammatory “accelerators”) and tolerant (non-inflammatory “brakes”) subpopulations. How these populations function in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), remains unresolved. Using multi-omics data and computational tools, here we define colon-specific macrophage states and reveal the critical role of non-inflammatory colon-associated macrophages (ni-ColAMs) in IBD recovery. Through trans-scale analyses—integrating computational transcriptomics, proteomics, and in vivo interventional studies—we pinpointed GIV (CCDC88A), a heterotrimeric G-protein modulator, as a key regulator of ni-ColAMs. Notably, GIV emerged as the top-ranked gene in ni-ColAMs that physically and functionally interacts with nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), an innate immune sensor implicated in both CD and UC. Myeloid-specific depletion of GIV exacerbates infectious colitis, prolongs disease course, and abolishes the protective effects of muramyl dipeptide (MDP) in chemical colitis and sepsis models. GIV is required for NOD2 to dampen inflammation and efficiently clear microbes. GIV binds directly to NOD2’s terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR#10) via its C-terminus. This interaction is disrupted in the CD-associated 1007fs NOD2 variant, which lacks LRR#10, leading to impaired bacterial sensing and clearance. Findings illuminate how GIV and NOD2 collaborate to maintain gut homeostasis and reveal how derailment of such collaboration may drive dysbiosis and inflammation in IBD.">

Red dot: overexpression, blue dot: underexpression, white/empty space no difference vs controls Methods Multicenter observational study of SARS-CoV-2-infected and/or vaccinated pregnant people and their infants. Pregnant people (infected [n=91], vaccinated [n=42], infected-and-vaccinated [n=14], controls [n=22]) and their infants (n=81, 38,14, 11, respectively) were included. Maternal blood samples were collected during different trimesters and at delivery. Infant blood samples were collected longitudinally from birth (< 72 hours), at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months of age. Whole blood RNA was extracted for RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data analyzed with R Transcriptional analysis of immune system development in early life Modular gene expression scores were analyzed longitudinally of individual infant samples. Red: higher expression, white: lower expression. D1-3: days 1 to 3, W1: week 1, M1: month 1, M3: month 3, M6: month 6 Results Compared with uninfected controls, interferon and plasma cells genes were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute infection (< 14 days), but underexpressed with earlier infection or vaccination during pregnancy (Figure 1). Newborns < 72 h of age (from all groups) showed significantly increased expression of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and inflammation genes. Expression of T/cytotoxic cell genes started to be observed at 1 week, while expression of B cells, plasma cells and interferon genes was observed at 3 months of age (Figure 2). Quantitative gene set enrichment analysis showed that compared to controls, infants from infected and/or vaccinated mothers had increased expression of interferon, while neutrophil, and adaptive immunity genes were decreased (Figure 3) SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination of pregnant people shaped immune profiles of their infants Fold changes of gene sets in infants compared to controls are shown (adjusted p-value <0.01) from quantitative gene set enrichment (QuSAGE) analysis. Red: overexpression, blue: underexpression. Infant groups are defined by maternal infection and/or vaccination status at delivery. Conclusion Interferon and plasma cells related pathways were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute COVID-19, while vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier in pregnancy were associated with under-expression of both innate and adaptive immunity genes. The infant immune system changed rapidly in the first few days of life, as different immune programs followed separate time trajectories.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019, was caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a shell virus containing a single positive chain genome and using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The targeting of SARS-CoV-2 on several tissues expressing ACE2 explains the multifactorial pattern of symptoms: fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue and shortness of breath. These symptoms do not always stop after COVID-19, and symptoms may reappear within 12 weeks, which indicates the development of post-COVID syndrome (long COVID). Due to the extensive symptoms and comorbidity of patients, the clinical diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome is difficult. The aim of the study is to identify pathognomonic indices of biochemical blood analysis in convalescents, indicating the development of post-COVID syndrome. 
Patients and study design: a retrospective observational one-moment study of 373 case histories and outpatient records was conducted for the patients exposed to COVID-19 not later than 12 weeks ago. The initial course of the disease (disease) was assessed using the WHO Clinical Progression Scale. The severity of post-COVID syndrome (clinical outcomes) was assessed on the functional status scale after COVID-19 (PCFS). All subjects are divided into four groups, the names of which reflect the severity of COVID-19 and the severity of the post-ovoid condition: 1st group, “mild COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 2nd group, “mild COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”; 3rd group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 4th group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”. The sample was described by calculating the median (Me) values and interquartile range expressed as Q1 and Q3 (Q0.25-Q0.75). The reliability of the differences between independent samples was assessed with nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test and the Student’s t-test. 
Upon evaluation of clinical blood biochemistry, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in group 1 was higher than in groups 2 and 4, the aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) level in group 2 was higher than in groups 1 and 3. The indexes of total cholesterol and LDL did not show statistically significant differences between the groups. Creatinine levels in group 3 are higher than in group 1, being lower in group 4 than in other groups. Significant differences were observed upon qualitative assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP). There were 2-3 times more subjects with elevated CRP levels in groups 2 and 4 than in group 1. 
A minimal biochemical profile, including an assessment of the level of transaminases and creatinine, a qualitative or quantitative assessment of C-reactive protein, may indicate development of chronic inflammation. Patients of this group need to undergo an additional examination, e.g., general urine analysis and determination of albumin level in urine, dynamic GFR calculation, in order to prevent the development of persistent renal impairment.">

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

        <tr id="The spatial organization of adaptive immune cells within lymph nodes is critical for understanding immune responses during infection and disease. Here, we introduce AIR-SPACE, an integrative approach that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with paired, high-fidelity long-read sequencing of T and B cell receptors. This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.">

        <tr id="Whilst there has been much focus on the function of neuronally expressed members of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor family (mAChR) less attention has been paid to the expression profile and role of the five members of this family (M1-M5 mAChRs) in non-neuronal cells of the brain. Using genetically engineered mice we identify a previously unappreciated sub-population of astrocytes expressing the M4 mAChR subtype. These are located in various brain regions that include the brainstem, hypothalamus and, most abundantly, the cerebellum. Signalling and proteomic analysis of M4 mAChR positive astrocytes from the cerebellum established the functional expression of this receptor subtype and its role in the regulation of protein expression. Genetic ablation of M4 mAChR positive astrocytes in mice revealed a specific role in locomotion behaviour. Importantly, in the context of murine prion disease, a model of terminal neurodegeneration associated with profound neuroinflammation, we observed a significant expansion of M4 mAChR positive astrocytes and report ablation experiments that established that this astrocyte sub-population has a detrimental effect on late-stage disease. Together we provide evidence of a sub-population of M4 mAChR expressing astrocytes that play a specific role in normal neurophysiology and the progression of inflammatory neurodegenerative disease.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) ESX-1, a type VII secretion system, is a key virulence determinant contributing to MTB’s survival within lung mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), but its effect on MNP recruitment and differentiation remains unknown. Here, using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing techniques, we studied the role of ESX-1 in MNP heterogeneity and response in mice and murine bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDM). We found that ESX-1 is required for MTB to recruit diverse MNP subsets with high MTB burden. Further, MTB induces a transcriptional signature of immune evasion in lung macrophages and BMDM in an ESX-1–dependent manner. Spatial transcriptomics revealed an up-regulation of permissive features within MTB lesions, where monocyte-derived macrophages concentrate near MTB-infected cells. Together, our findings suggest that MTB ESX-1 facilitates the recruitment and differentiation of MNPs, which MTB can infect and manipulate for survival. Our dataset across various models and methods could contribute to the broader understanding of recruited cell heterogeneity during MTB lung infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted via aerosols. To understand how MeV exits the airways of an infected host, we use unpassaged primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE). MeV typically remains cell-associated in HAE and forms foci of infection, termed infectious centers, by directly spreading cell-to-cell. We previously described the phenomenon in which infectious centers detach en masse from HAE and remain viable. Here, we investigate the mechanism of this cellular detachment. Via immunostaining, we observed loss of tight junction and cell adhesion proteins within infectious centers. These morphological changes indicate activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can contribute to wound healing in respiratory epithelia by mobilizing nearby cells. Inhibiting TGF-β, and thus EMT, reduced infectious center detachment. Compared with uninfected cells, MeV-infected cells also expressed increased levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a regulator of live cell extrusion. Live cell extrusion encourages cells to detach from respiratory epithelia by contracting the actomyosin of neighboring cells. Inhibition or induction of live cell extrusion impacted infectious center detachment rates. Thus, these two related pathways contributed to infectious center detachment in HAE. Detached infectious centers contained high titers of virus that may be protected from the environment, allowing the virus to live on surfaces longer and infect more hosts. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen that continues to cause large, disruptive outbreaks each year. Here, we examine mechanisms of detachment of MeV-infected cells. MeV spreads cell-to-cell in human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to form groups of infected cells, termed “infectious centers”. We reported that infectious centers ultimately detach from HAE as a unit, carrying high titers of virus. Viral particles within cells may be more protected from environmental conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. We identified two host pathways, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and live cell extrusion, that contribute to infectious center detachment. Perturbing these pathways altered the kinetics of infectious center detachment. These pathways influence one another and contribute to epithelial wound healing, suggesting that infectious center detachment may be a usurped consequence of the host’s response to infection that benefits MeV by increasing its transmissibility between hosts.">

        <tr id="Cranial radiotherapy causes progressive neurocognitive impairments in cancer survivors. Neuroinflammation is believed to be a key contributor, but its dynamics and consequences for brain function remain poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive longitudinal profiling, from 6 hours to 1 year after irradiation (IR) of the mouse hippocampus, using transcriptomic, protein and histological analyses. We identified a delayed microglial response coupling interferon signaling to mitotic progression, and a subsequent induction of temporally regulated subtypes. IR rewired the parenchymal phagocyte profiles due to progressive microglial loss, failure of repopulation through self-renewal and compensatory generation of microglia-like cells derived from peripheral monocytes. These findings were confirmed in autopsied human brain. Finally, we demonstrate two phases of neuronal asynchrony, an early one associated with inflammation and a late one associated with synaptic aberrant regulation. These results provide comprehensive, longitudinal insights into microglia responses that can aid tailoring therapies to preserve cognition in cancer survivors.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical syndrome with a mortality rate of up to 40%, and it is characterized by a prominent inflammatory cascade. The inflammasome and pyroptosis play crucial regulatory roles in regulating various inflammatory-related diseases by serving as pivotal signaling platforms for inflammatory responses and mediating the release of substantial quantities of inflammatory factors. Our previous studies confirmed that GC-1, a clinical-stage thyroid hormone analog, effectively mitigated pulmonary fibrosis by restoring mitochondrial function in epithelial cells. However, the potential effects of GC-1 on macrophage inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis in lung injury as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Methods: The effects of GC-1 on lung injury, oxidative damage and inflammation were evaluated in two murine models of ALI (LPS- or HCl-induced models) by assessing lung pathology, the concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 in BAL fluid, inflammasome and the levels of inflammasome- and pyroptosis-related proteins. Additionally, the impact of GC-1 on ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis was investigated by examining ROS levels, Nrf2 signaling, and inflammasome adaptor protein ASC levels in mouse alveolar macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages treated with LPS and ATP. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and the mitochondrial-ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO were used to further elucidate the effect of GC-1 on the Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. Results: GC-1 significantly alleviated inflammation and lung injury in ALI model mice, as indicated by pulmonary pathology, inflammatory cytokine levels, ROS production and pyroptosis rates. Consistently, GC-1 inhibited ASC recruitment and oligomerization in macrophages, which suppressed the gasdermin D-mediated release of IL-1β and IL-18. These findings indicated a reduction in inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis initiation. Further research revealed that GC-1 may mitigate oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial damage through Nrf2 signaling, thereby inhibiting the expression of ROS-activated p53 and the target gene ASC. This protective effect of GC-1 could be reversed by ML385 and mimicked by Mito-TEMPO. Conclusions: This study presents a novel mechanism for treating ALI in which GC-1 inhibits macrophage ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis through Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. These findings highlight the promising potential of the use of GC-1 as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drug in the treatment of ALI/ARDS.">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a plethora of long-COVID symptoms for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe symptoms, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. Methods: This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Results: Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group who previously exhibited different symptoms (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered groups, significantly elevated in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. Following vaccination, the recovered group who experienced disease history showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p<0.005). Notably, antibody titers are negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p<0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days of two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, the titers were comparable to the baseline titer, indicating the importance of vaccination and booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infectious history. To ensure long-term respiratory health, this study emphasizes the significance of evaluating pulmonary function in those who might have contained asymptomatic COVID-19 infections as well as those who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, these findings underscore the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history as a key strategy in pandemic preparedness. Conclusions: To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="Abstract Some of the millions of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have developed new sequelae after recovering from the initial disease, termed post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (PASC). One symptom is anxiety, which is likely due to three etiologies: brain structural changes, neuroendocrine disruption, and neurotransmitter alterations. This review provides an overview of the current literature on the pathophysiological pathways linking coronavirus disease 2019 to anxiety, as well as the possible mechanisms of action in which an increasingly scrutinized treatment method, enhanced external counter-pulsation (EECP), is able to alleviate anxiety. SARS-CoV-2 triggers increased inflammatory cytokine production, as well as oxidative stress; these processes contribute to the aforementioned three etiologies. The potential treatment approach of EECP, involving sequenced inflation and deflation of specifically-placed airbags, has become of increasing interest, as it has been found to alleviate PASC-associated anxiety by improving patient cardiovascular function. These functional improvements were achieved by EECP stimulating anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic processes, as well as improving endothelial cell function and coronary blood flow, partially via counteracting against the negative effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Therefore, EECP could promote both psychosomatic and cardiac rehabilitation. Further research, though, is still needed to fully determine its benefits and mechanism of action.">

        <tr id="The current lack of a straightforward and convenient modeling approach to simulate the onset of acute lung injury (ALI) has impeded fundamental research and hindered the screening of therapeutic drugs in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The co-cultured human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpics) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) were exposed to the complete medium, three concentrations of recombinant spike S1 protein (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/mL), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 μg/mL). The cells were harvested at 1, 2, and 3 days post-exposure. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and IL-6, TNF-ɑ, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production were quantified and compared. Compared to those exposed to medium, co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs exposed to a concentration of S1 protein at 10 μg/mL demonstrated significantly increased levels of LDH release (22.9% vs. 9.1%, and 25.7%), IL-6 (129 vs. 74, and 110 pg/mg of protein), and TNF-ɑ (75 vs. 51, and 86 pg/mg of protein) production, and similar to those exposed to LPS. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in MDA production. Compared to those harvested at 1 or 2 days post-exposure, co-cultured cells harvested at 3 days post-exposure exhibited increased levels of LDH release (23.4% vs. 14.9%, or 16.7%), IL-6 (127 vs. 81, or 97 pg/mg of protein) and MDA (5.6 vs. 3.2, or 3.8 nmol/mg of protein) production, but exhibited lower TNF-ɑ (58 vs. 79 pg/mg of protein) production than those harvested at 2 days post-exposure. After 3 days of exposure, co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs showed significantly increased levels of LDH release (25.3% vs. 18.4%), and MDA production (5.5 vs. 4.3 nmol/mg of protein) compared to HPAEpics monocultures, and increased levels of LDH release (25.3% vs. 13.8%), IL-6 (139 vs. 98 pg/mg of protein) and MDA (5.5 vs. 4.7 nmol/mg of protein) production, and decreased TNF-ɑ (59 vs. 95 pg/mg of protein) production compared to AMs monocultures. Conclusions: The exposure to a concentration of S1 protein at 10 μg/mL in co-cultures of HPAEpics and AMs induced significant injury and inflammation three days post-exposure. This methodology for establishing a COVID-19-associated ALI model may have promising potential applications and value.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes have been implicated as central mediators of neuroinflammatory processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several cardiovascular complications, including myocarditis, which can be a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause cardiac muscle inflammation through direct mechanisms, such as viral invasion of myocardial cells, and indirect mechanisms, such as the systemic inflammatory response. Myocarditis can lead to life-threatening electrical dysfunctions and arrhythmias. Although post-infection myocarditis is more common, rare cases of post-vaccination myocarditis have also been reported, especially with mRNA vaccines. However, these post-vaccination cases tend to be mild and self-limiting, with a good response to treatment. Despite the associated risks, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections and related heart complications. It is crucial to continue surveillance and research to better understand the association between COVID-19, myocarditis and sudden cardiac death in the young and improve prevention and intervention strategies. In this literature review, we analyzed the pathogenetic mechanisms and histological features of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 and its vaccination, and focused on the correlation with sudden cardiac death.">

        <tr id="Type III interferons (IFNs) primarily act on epithelial cells and protect against virus infection of the mucosa, whereas type I IFNs act more systemically. To date, it has been unknown which epithelial subtypes in the upper airways, the primary site for initial infection for most respiratory viruses, primarily rely on type III IFN or type I IFNs for antiviral protection. To address this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptomics analysis of the epithelial IFN-mediated response focusing on the upper airways of mice. This work identified nine distinct cell types derived from the olfactory epithelium and thirteen distinct cell types from the respiratory epithelium. Interestingly, type I IFNs induced a stronger antiviral transcriptional response than type III IFN in respiratory epithelial cells, whereas in olfactory epithelial cells, including sustentacular (SUS) and Bowman's gland cells (BGC), type III IFN was more dominant compared to type I IFN. SUS and BGC, which provide structural support and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, were highly susceptible to infection with a mouse-adapted variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA20) but were protected against infection if the animals were prophylactically treated with type III IFN. These findings demonstrate a high degree of cell type heterogeneity in terms of interferon-mediated antiviral responses and reveal a potent role for type III IFNs in protecting the olfactory epithelium.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 infects SUS and BGC in the olfactory epithelium, causing an impairment of structural support and integrity of olfactory sensory neurons that can result in severe olfactory dysfunctions. We observed an unexpected compartmentalization of the IFN-mediated transcriptional response within the airway epithelium, and we found that olfactory epithelial cells preferentially respond to type III IFN, which resulted in robust antiviral protection of SUS and BGC. Given the proximity of the olfactory epithelium to the central nervous system, we hypothesize that evolution favored a type III IFN-biased antiviral immune response in this tissue to limit inflammatory responses in the brain. Cell type-specific antiviral responses in the upper airways, triggered by the different types of IFNs, should be investigated in more detail and carefully taken into consideration during the development of IFN-based antivirals for clinical use.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the behavior of B cells during infection and vaccination is important for determining protective humoral immunity. We evaluated the profile of humoral immunity and B cell pool in individuals who were acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2, recovered from COVID-19, or received two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these individuals were subjected to in vitro stimulation to promote the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and the ELISpot evaluated the abundance of pan and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-reactive IgG+ ASC. Stimulated PBMCs were characterized using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were assessed for soluble B-cell-activating factors. The IgA and IgG for the S1 were evaluated through ELISA. Results: The recovered individuals displayed a robust S1 ASC compared to acute and vaccinated individuals. Although the frequency of total B cells or B cell subsets did not vary among the groups, plasmablast cells were increased in naïve and double-negative B cells in the acute, recovered, and vaccinated individuals. Similar IgA and IgG production appeared to be present in the acute and recovered individuals. During vaccination, more IgG is produced than IgA. In acute patients, BAFF levels were positively correlated with total B cells and IgG+ plasmablast cells but negatively correlated with IgA+ plasmablast cells. Conclusions: Vaccination and natural infection with COVID-19 induce a differential profile and functionality of B cells. We suggest that new vaccines against COVID-19 incorporate molecular adjuvants that regulate B lymphocyte functionality and consider the beneficial aspects of the IgA response in addition to IgG.">

Antivirals had no efficacy in randomized clinical trials (RCT) for Epstein-Barr Virus and HHV-6. Enteroviruses (EV) have been implicated, but no antivirals are available. Many patients who received SARS–CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs for acute Covid-19 (COV19) infection experienced significant improvement of prior ME/CFS symptoms. This study summarizes their responses to antivirals for SARS-Cov-2. Methods Neutralizing Antibody (NA) for Coxsackievirus B (CVB)1-6 and Echovirus 6, 7, 9, 11, 30 were done by ARUP lab. Enterovirus Protein (EVP) of Peripheral Blood Leukocytes (PBL) was determined by Western Blot. ME/CFS patients fulfilled Canadian consensus criteria, and had either elevated NA for enteroviruses and/or positive EVP in PBL. ME/CFS patients hospitalized for acute COV19 infection and patients without COV19, were given 5-10 days of IV Remdesivir (Rem) +/- immune modulators. Controls: 20 ME/CFS patients seen concurrently without Remdesivir treatment. Other ME/CFS patients (non-COV19) were given Nirmaltrelvir/Ritonavir (PAX) daily for 10 days +/- one repeat. The energy index (EI) was monitored by the patients before, during and after treatment. Significant improvement was defined as > 30%. Results 15/20 (75%) ME/CFS patients – 10/12 hospitalized, 5/8 non-COV19 patients – responded to IV Rem 2-6 weeks after infusions; remission lasted 6-8 weeks to 6-9 months before relapse. Of Controls: 2/20 had mild improvement (< 0.001, X 2 ). 104/200 (52%) of PAX-treated ME/CFS patients improved, often within 2-3 days; all relapsed within days to weeks after treatment. 66%, 33% and 44% of CVB4+, CVB3+, non-CVB3,4+ patients responded to treatment, respectively. EVP decreased and increased with clinical response and relapse. Conclusion Rem and PAX demonstrated clinical efficacy in ME/CFS patients with chronic enterovirus infections.

        <tr id="HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions—the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum—enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.">

Using high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, we have examined in-depth proteomic profiles of non-stimulated and LPS or IFN-γ challenged HMC3 and C20 cells. Our findings reveal that HMC3 cells responded to both treatments through upregulation of immune, metabolic, and antiviral pathways, while C20 cells showed a response associated with mitochondrial and immune activities. Additionally, the secretome analysis demonstrated that both cell lines release IL-6 in response to LPS, while IFN-γ treatment resulted in altered kynurenine pathway activity, highlighting distinct immune and metabolic adaptations.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with increased rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and death in elderly individuals. Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals. IMPORTANCE Elderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected individuals showed either mild symptoms or were paucisymptomatic, with severe impact on human health, revealing heightened risk and direct effects on health. Among various factors contributing to complications, bacterial and fungal co-infection remains very common and is highly lethal. This narrative review aims to focus on the collective role of gut microbiota and mycobiota in COVID-19. Fungal infection has been identified as a key risk factor for the spread of COVID-19 and mortality. Gut mycobiomes diversity and abundance also vary due to the different types of SARS-CoV-2 variant infection. Their cross-talk plays a vital role in immune regulation and disease severity, with an emphasis on understanding the altered condition as a predictive marker. On the other hand, the gut microbiome is well known for shaping metabolic functions, generating immune responses, and deciphering the signal to decide the healthy state and disease condition of an individual. Immune response during COVID-19 infection was also linked with metabolites produced by the gut microflora, specifically amino acids, sugar metabolites, and neurotransmitters. The cross-talk between gut microbiota and gut mycobiota for clinical implications in terms of early detection, identification of the disease severity, and even therapeutic alternatives will open newer avenues. A deep dive understanding of the cross-talk between the microbiome and mycobiome, and their role in immune response will take scientific discovery knowledge to develop gut-targeted safe therapeutic approaches in the form of FMT (fecal microbiota transplantation) probiotics, peptides, antibacterial, and antifungal metabolites. Overall cross-talk and immune interplay are critical determinants of host immunity, providing insights into their role and key take home lessons for better management of crisis in the future.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The pathogenesis of Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) following mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 3–6% of people suffer from post-COVID condition or syndrome (PCS). A subset meets the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA can persist after acute infection in serum or tissues, but their role in PCS is unclear. Methods: Here, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analyzed in the serum of 121 PCS patients with predominant fatigue and exertional intolerance, of whom 72 met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, 37 post-COVID recovered healthy controls, and 32 pre-pandemic healthy controls. Results: Spike protein was detected in the serum of 11% of recovered controls, 2% of PCS patients, and 14% of ME/CFS patients between 4 and 31 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not in pre-pandemic samples. The occurrence and concentration of spike protein did not correlate with infection or vaccination timepoints. In ME/CFS patients, spike protein presence was not associated with the severity of symptoms or functional disability. In 5 out of 22 patients who under-went immunoglobulin depletion, spike protein levels were reduced or undetectable after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. Conclusions: In summary, this study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients but found no association with ME/CFS.">

        <tr id="Introduction Despite the efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, inflammatory and/or thrombotic episodes have been reported. Since the impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the endothelium remains uncertain, our objective was to assess endothelial activation status before and 90 days after the third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Methods A prospective longitudinal study was conducted at University General Hospital of Albacete, involving 38 healthy health-care workers. Serum levels of endothelial markers (endocan and sVCAM-1) and spike S1-specific IgG antibodies were determined before and at 7, 15, 24 and 90days following vaccination. To analyze each participant´s individual response, we calculated relative increases/decreases (delta values) in endothelial markers and antibodies concentrations compared to their pre-vaccination levels. Results We identified two significantly distinct profiles of endothelial markers response, characterized by either increased or decreased serum levels of endocan and sVCAM. Incremental and decremental response groups did not differ in terms of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and influenza vaccine co-administration. However, these responses were significantly associated with the relative spike-specific antibody production. Specifically, the greatest relative increase in antibodies was found in the decremental responders. Additionally, the higher delta antibody production was observed in non-previously infected individuals Conclusion Administration of the BNT162b2 booster vaccine triggered a non-homogenous response of endothelial function markers among the study participants. Our findings improve the understanding of individual responses to the mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine, which could be useful in assessing the need for booster doses, particularly in population at risk of vascular complications.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

 Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have substantially extended survival in a subset of patients with cancer, they remain ineffective in most patients. Personalized mRNA vaccines sensitize tumors to ICIs in part by unleashing a cytokine/chemokine cascade that broadly activates immune cells. Since this cascade is not dependent on mRNA species, we hypothesized that mRNA vaccines encoding non-tumor-specific antigens might also be used to reset immunotolerance and sensitize response to ICIs. Here, we show that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein dramatically augment responses to ICIs. In two cohorts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma, receipt of a COVID mRNA vaccine within 100 days of ICI initiation was associated with near doubling of overall survival after controlling for over 38 covariates with Cox Proportional Hazards Regression. Preclinical models confirmed that mRNA vaccines targeting SARS-COV-2 sensitize response to ICIs. By inducing a surge in interferon-α and Th1 chemokines, spike mRNA vaccines mediate antigen presenting cell co-localization with T cells in lymphoid organs for induction of anti-tumor immunity. Due to increases in PD-L1 on tumor cells, concomitant ICI treatment elicits increased PD-1+ T cells and epitope spreading against cancer associated antigens. Similar correlates of response were seen in both patients and healthy volunteers. Together, these results demonstrate that clinically available mRNA vaccines targeting non-tumor antigens are potent immune modulators capable of sensitizing tumors to ICIs.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2 infection induces interferon (IFN) response by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we show that the bulk of the IFN-I release comes from pDC sensing of infected cells and not cell-free virions. Physical contact (or conjugates) between pDCs and infected cells is mediated through CD54-CD11a engagement, and such conjugate formation is required for efficient IFN-I production. Interestingly, CD11a is inducible on infected epithelial cells when they are co-cultured with PBMCs, thus allowing for potentially bidirectional cross-talks between CD54 and CD11a, which further amplify the sensing. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) are sensed less efficiently than the Wuhan ancestral strain (LSPQ1), but the mechanisms driving the defect are different among the VOCs. CD11a induction on infected cells is correlated with their ability to form cell conjugates with pDCs. Impaired sensing of the Alpha variant is linked to reduced CD11a induction on infected cells and to fewer conjugates formed with pDCs. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are sensed by pDCs and reveal that this process is targeted by some VOCs to limit IFN-I production. IMPORTANCE Type I interferons (IFN-I) represent an important component of the host’s innate defense against initial SARS-CoV-2 infections. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce large quantities of IFN-I upon recognition of viral particles or infected cells. This study shows that pDCs sense infected cells more efficiently than viral particles, leading to a higher production of IFN-I. Physical contact between a pDC and an infected cell is critical to this process; the interaction is mediated via CD11a and ICAM-1 complex and potentially is bidirectional. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have evolved to limit the IFN response through different mechanisms. For the Alpha variant, reduced level of CD11a on infected cells is linked to less contact with pDCs and decreased IFN-I release. Overall, our study characterizes some of the early steps involved in pDC-mediated response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and shows that these processes are targeted by VOCs to likely limit IFN-I response and enhance viral spread.">

Using bulk RNA sequencing, we analyzed lung tissues at early (1h, 8h) and acute infection (2d, 3d), as well as post-resolution (30d) time-points. At 2 days post-infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed heightened innate immune responses, including chemokine and interferon signaling pathways. By 30 days post-infection, gene expression profiles and histological changes normalized, reflecting resolution of inflammation. Stratifying mice into recovered, sick, and moribund phenotypes during the acute infection phase highlighted significant transcriptional distinctions, including upregulated pro-inflammatory genes and Schlafen family members. Arginase 1 emerged as a predictive marker of disease severity, with elevated expression detectable as early as 8 hours post-infection. Comparative analyses revealed significant overlap between transcriptional responses in our model and those from a Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia model, implicating conserved pathways, such as IL-17 and Toll-like receptor signaling. Additionally, murine DEGs correlated with human plasma proteins associated with severe CAP, including CCL8 and CD14, suggesting translational relevance. This study underscores phase-specific transcriptional reprogramming during pneumococcal pneumonia and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in severe CAP cases.">

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease, characterized by impaired wound repair, tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Immune system may participate in the development and progression of the disease as indicated by altered activity in IPF sufferers. This study investigates the immune response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IPF compared to healthy controls, with a particular focus on evaluation of antibody responses, interferon-gamma release, cytokine profiling and a broad panel of immune cell subpopulations. IPF patients without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 had undetectable levels of anti-N IgG antibodies, highlighting their lack of previous infection. After vaccination, IPF patients showed a significant increase in anti-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies, though their levels were lower compared to healthy controls and convalescent IPF patients. Additionally, IPF patients exhibited altered proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) before and after vaccination. Specifically, IPF patients had higher percentages of Tregs with a Th2 phenotype and Th17 Tregs, along with reduced proportions of Th1/17 Tregs. Teffs in IPF patients showed a decrease in Th1-like and Th2-like populations after vaccination. Moreover, IPF patients demonstrated elevated populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) before vaccination and increased levels of γδ Tc cells throughout the study. Alterations in cytokine profiles were also observed, IPF patients showed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-22 compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest a distinct immune response in IPF patients to the COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by differences in antibody production, T cell differentiation and cytokine secretion compared to healthy individuals.">

        <tr id="Background: The Safety and Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccines in Systemic Autoimmune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (SUCCEED) study was created to better understand COVID-19 vaccination in immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID). Knowing the frequency of COVID-19 breakthrough infections is important, particularly in IMID. Our objective was to assess these events in IMID. Methods: We prospectively studied IMID participants who had received ≥three COVID-19 vaccine doses. Individuals provided saliva samples monthly (September 2022 to August 2023). These were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. We also assessed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (anti-spike, SmT1, receptor binding domain, RBD, and nucleocapsid, NP) based on dried blood spots. Multivariable general estimating equation regression produced odd ratios (OR) for PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity, related to demographics, immunosuppressives, and antibody levels. Results: Diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis RA (N = 161, 44% of the total), systemic lupus, psoriatic arthritis, spondylarthritis, vasculitis, systemic sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Of the 366 participants, most were taking immunosuppressive medication. Of 1266 saliva samples, 56 (5.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR. Higher anti-SmT1 antibodies were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection on PCR (adjusted OR 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.97). Antibodies to SmT1, RBD, and NP were correlated and thus could not be included in a single model, but when anti-RBD was used in place of anti-SmT1, the results were similar. No other factor (including prior COVID-19 infection) was clearly associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: This is the first study of SARS-CoV-2 in a large prospective cohort of triple (or more) vaccinated individuals with IMIDs. Anti-SmT1 antibodies appeared to be protective against later SARS-CoV-2 positivity, although recent past infection was not clearly related. This suggests the importance of maintaining robust vaccine-induced immunity through vaccination in IMID.">

        <tr id="Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, ∼10-35% of COVID-19 patients experience long COVID (LC), in which often debilitating symptoms persist for at least three months. Elucidating the biologic underpinnings of LC could identify therapeutic opportunities. We utilized machine learning methods on biologic analytes and patient reported outcome surveys provided over 12 months after hospital discharge from >500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the IMPACC cohort to identify a multi-omics “recovery factor”. IMPACC participants who experienced LC had lower recovery factor scores compared to participants without LC. Biologic characterization revealed increased levels of plasma proteins associated with inflammation, elevated transcriptional signatures of heme metabolism, and decreased androgenic steroids in LC patients. The recovery factor was also associated with altered circulating immune cell frequencies. Notably, recovery factor scores were predictive of LC occurrence in patients as early as hospital admission, irrespective of acute disease severity. Thus, the recovery factor identifies patients at risk of LC early after SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals LC biomarkers and potential treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown. Methods and results In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients. Conclusion We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="Identifying senescent cells poses challenges due to their rarity, heterogeneity, and lack of a definitive marker. We performed Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on non-pathological human tissue to build a transcriptomic atlas of aging and senescence in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). We identified markers characteristic of aging dlPFC cortical layers and cell types. We also observed an increase in astrocyte abundance and decrease in somatostatin expressing inhibitory neurons. Overall, the senescence profile in the dlPFC was highly heterogeneous and heavily influenced by cell type identity and cortical layer. Combined unbiased analysis of ST and snRNA-seq datasets revealed gene expression modules encoding for communities of microglia and endothelial cells in the white matter and regional astrocytes programs that were strongly enriched with age and for senescence-related genes. These findings will help facilitate future studies exploring the function of senescent cell subpopulations in the aging brain.">

        <tr id="Maladaptive host metabolic responses to infection are emerging as major determinants of infectious disease pathogenesis. However, the factors regulating these metabolic changes within tissues remain poorly understood. In this study, we used toxoplasmosis, as a prototypical example of a disease regulated by strong type I immune responses, to assess the relative roles of local parasite burden, local tissue inflammation and the microbiome in shaping local tissue metabolism during acute and chronic infection. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This protozoan infects the small intestine and then disseminates to nearly every organ in the acute stage of infection, before establishing chronic infection in the skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and brain. We compared metabolism in eleven sampling sites in C57BL/6 mice during the acute and chronic stage of T. gondii infection. Strikingly, significant metabolic changes were observed in the large intestine and colon during chronic infection, organs not associated with T. gondii persistence. Overall, major spatial mismatches were observed between metabolic perturbation and local parasite burden for both disease stages. In contrast, a stronger association with indicators of type I immune responses was observed, indicating a tighter relationship between metabolic perturbation and local immunity, than with local parasite burden. In addition, we observed significant changes in microbiota composition with infection, and candidate microbial origins for multiple metabolites impacted by infection. These findings highlight the metabolic consequences of toxoplasmosis across different organs, and their regulators. Importance Inflammation is a major driver of tissue perturbation. However, the signals driving these changes on a tissue-intrinsic and molecular level are poorly understood. This study evaluated tissue-specific metabolic perturbations across eleven sampling sites following systemic murine infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Results revealed relationships between differential metabolite enrichment and variables including inflammatory signals, pathogen burden and commensal microbial communities. These data will inform hypotheses about the signals driving specific metabolic adaptation in acute and chronic protozoan infection, with broader implications for infection and inflammation in general.">

However, the molecular mechanism for the increased mortality in cancer patients infected with COVID-19 is unclear. Methods Colony formation and wound healing assays were performed on Huh-7 cells cocultured with syncytia. Exosomes were purified from the cell supernatant and verified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western blot (WB) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Differentially expressed proteins in syncytia-derived exosomes (Syn-Exos) and their functions was analyzed by Proteomic sequencing. Syn-Exo-mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was measured by CCK-8 and Transwell migration assays. The mechanism by which Syn-Exos promote tumor growth was analyzed by Western blotting. A patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) mouse model was constructed to evaluate the pathological role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S). The number of syncytia in the tumor tissue sections was determined by immunofluorescence analysis. Results Syncytium formation promoted the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Proteomic sequencing revealed that proteins that regulate cell proliferation and metastasis in Syn-Exos were significantly upregulated. Syn-Exos promote the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Animal experiments showed that a pseudotyped lentivirus bearing SARS-2-S (SARS-2-Spp) promoted tumor development in PDX mice. More syncytia were found in tumor tissue from SARS-2-Spp mice than from VSV-Gpp mice. Conclusions Syn-Exos induced by SARS-2-S can promote the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.">

        <tr id="  COVID-19 disease is a clinical syndrome caused by an envelope RNA virus, called SARS-COV-2., which causes infection with wildly clinical pictures. Through COVID-19 infection several components of humoral and cellular immune response have an important role in the progression of the infection. Chemokines are one of the inflammatory mediators that play an essential role in the immune pathogenesis of COVID-19. It is secreted by respiratory virus-infected cells in the upper respiratory tract, causing stimulation and recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, NK, eosinophils, and macrophages from the bloodstream to the site of the infection. This study strives to determine the impact role of inflammatory mediator chemokine RANTES (CCL5) in COVID-19 Iraq patients. Blood samples collected from 180 individuals were enrolled in this study, 120 of them were patients infected with COVID-19 and verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients were categorized into two groups based on the severity of the disease, the severe group included 60 patients and the mild/moderate group included 60 patients also. Furthermore, 60 healthy individuals who were confirmed to be COVID-19-negative were enrolled in this study as a control group. The quantitative detection of CCL5 in human serum was done by the CCL5 Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay kit based on the principle of sandwich ELISA. This study showed that there were interesting highly significant differences (p<0.001) in the median serum level of CCL5 between all groups that participated in this study and there was a significant increase in the median level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate groups versus severe patients’ group (66.66 pg/ml, and 54.04 pg/ml vs. 38.41 pg/ml respectively). According to the results of this study, the low level of CCL5 associated with COVID-19 severity infection could be used as a predictor marker for severity while the elevated level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate suggested the elevated level of this chemokine is likely to be associated with the resolution of inflammation and recovery.">

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is a human pathogen that causes local and systemic infections of the skin and mucous membranes. However, GAS is also found asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of infants. GAS infections, including pharyngitis and invasive pneumosepsis, pose significant public health concerns. Streptokinase, a key virulence factor of GAS, activates human plasminogen, facilitating bacterial dissemination. Plasminogen, traditionally known for its role in fibrinolysis, may also modulate host immune responses. We therefore aim to investigate systemic and cardiac immune cell responses during pneumonia and pneumosepsis with GAS in a murine infection model. The interaction of streptokinase with human plasminogen is species-specific, therefore the murine pneumosepsis model was developed in a transgenic mouse strain that produces human plasminogen. The data show a critical role of human plasminogen for GAS colonization and systemic spread via the nasopharynx. Due to pneumosepsis blood immune cell profiles and plasma protein levels significantly alters, indicating potential biomarkers for distinguishing local from systemic infection. In the hearts of animals with invasive infection proinflammatory immune cells significantly increased and likely displaced resident healing macrophages. The established pneumosepsis model is useful to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying local and invasive pneumonia caused by GAS and to investigate new therapeutic options.">

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to significant global morbidity and mortality. While many patients recover, a subset experiences persistent pulmonary complications, including post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF), a condition characterized by irreversible lung scarring and impaired gas exchange. Several risk factors, such as advanced age, male sex, pre-existing lung disease, and severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, contribute to its development. Radiological assessments, particularly high-resolution computed tomography, reveal hallmark features such as reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and parenchymal bands, aiding in diagnosis. Current therapeutic strategies include corticosteroids, antifibrotic agents (pirfenidone, Nintedanib), and immunosuppressants, though no standardized treatment exists. Pulmonary rehabilitation and supplemental oxygen therapy offer symptomatic relief and improved functional outcomes. Future research explores novel agents, including buloxibutid, saracatinib, sirolimus, and resveratrol, as potential antifibrotic therapies. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and evolving treatment strategies for PCPF, emphasizing the need for continued research to optimize patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The contributions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells to vaccine efficacy and durability are unclear. We investigated relationships between mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific interferon- gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody development in long-term care home staff doubly vaccinated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. The impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity on cellular and humoral responses to vaccination were additionally assessed. Mathematical modeling of the kinetics of spike-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 T-cell responses over 6 months post-second dose was bifurcated into recipients who exhibited gradual increases with doubling times of 155 and 167 days or decreases with half-lives of 165 and 132 days, respectively. Differences in kinetics did not correlate with clinical phenotypes. Serological anti-spike IgG, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, anti-spike IgA, and anti-RBD IgA antibody levels otherwise decayed in all participants with half-lives of 63, 57, 79, and 46 days, respectively, alongside waning neutralizing capacity (t1/2 = 408 days). Spike-specific T-cell responses induced at 2-6 weeks positively correlated with live viral neutralization at 6 months post-second dose, especially in hybrid immune individuals. Participants with pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 exhibited greater spike-specific T-cell responses, reduced anti-RBD IgA antibody levels, and a trending increase in neutralization at 2-6 weeks post-second dose. Non-spike-specific T-cells predominantly targeted SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein at 6 months post-second dose in cross-reactive participants. mRNA vaccination was lastly shown to induce off-target T-cell responses against unrelated antigens. In summary, vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell immunity appeared to influence serological neutralizing capacity, with only a modest effect induced by pre-existing cross-reactivity.


IMPORTANCE
Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential contributions of mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell responses to the durability of neutralizing antibody levels in both uninfected and hybrid immune recipients. Our study additionally sheds light on the precise impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on the magnitude and kinetics of cellular and humoral responses to vaccination. Accordingly, our data will help optimize the development of next-generation T cell-based coronavirus vaccines and vaccine regimens to maximize efficacy and durability.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with the development of fetal complications such as microcephaly. We have recently demonstrated that palmitoleate protects against ZIKV-induced apoptosis in placental trophoblasts. In the present study, we hypothesize that palmitoleate prevents ZIKV infection-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in neurons. Neurons were infected with 0.1-1 multiplicity of infection of recombinant MR766 or PRVABC59 strains of ZIKV for an hour followed by treatment of palmitoleate (100 µM-200 µM) for different post-infection time points. Apoptosis was measured by nuclear morphological changes, caspase 3/7 activity, and immunoblot analysis of pro-apoptotic mediators. Activation of ER stress markers and viral envelope levels were detected using qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Infectious virus particles were measured by using plaque assay. ZIKV infection to neuronal cells showed increased levels of pro-apoptotic markers like cleaved-PARP, cleaved caspase-3, Bim, and Puma, whereas decreased levels of anti-apoptotic markers such as Mcl-1, Bcl-1, and Bcl-xL. Further, we observed activation of three arms of ER stress namely: inositol requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1), protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor (ATF6) pathways with ZIKV infection. Treatment of palmitoleate dramatically decreased ZIKV infection-induced increase in percent apoptotic nuclei and caspase 3/7 activity. Further, treatment of palmitoleate decreased cleaved PARP and PUMA protein expressions. Treatment of palmitoleate reduced ZIKV-induced ER stress activation as evidenced by decreased levels of phosphorylated forms of IRE1 and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha; decreased expressions of cleaved ATF6, spliced X-box associated protein 1 and C/EBP homologous protein compared to ZIKV infection alone. Further, treatment of palmitoleate attenuated ZIKV envelope levels and infectious titer in SH-SY5Y and primary fetal cortical neurons isolated from humanized STAT2 knockin mice. These data suggest that palmitoleate supplementation protects against ZIKV-induced neuronal ER stress, apoptosis and decreases Zika viral load thereby mitigates neuronal damage.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators of antiviral immunity, yet their role in lymphoid tissues—key reservoirs of HIV persistence—remains poorly defined. Here, we uncover a distinct cytotoxic signature of tonsil-resident NK cells essential for targeting HIV-infected CD4⁺ T cells. Using a human tonsillar model of HIV infection and extracellular matrix-based functional assays, we identify a subset of NK cells co-expressing CD69, CD49a, CD103, and the adaptive marker NKG2C as potent effectors against autologous HIV-infected tissue CD4⁺ T cells. Both CD16⁺ and CD16⁻ NK subsets exhibited cytotoxic antiviral activity. However, HIV infection induced profound functional alterations in these NK cells, including dysregulated expression of CD9, TRAF2, ITGA1, suggesting disrupted activation, signaling, and tissue residency. Functional assays corroborated a significant impairment in the cytotoxic capacity, indicating HIV-driven NK cell dysfunction. Intriguingly, a subset of immature CD16⁻CD69⁺ NK cells underwent functional reprogramming, transitioning into a migration-competent, and metabolically primed state, driven by the upregulation of NUMAI, LCP1, SLC38A1, MT-ND2, NUMA1, MYH9, and CD44. Functional assays confirmed this transition, revealing changes in the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and a gain of cytotoxic function in these reprogrammed cells. These findings advance our understanding of NK cell biology in HIV infection and highlight novel avenues for NK-cell-based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lyme arthritis (LA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, with approximately 10-20% of patients developing antibiotic resistance. Macrophages in the synovial microenvironment play a crucial role in disease progression, but their precise regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Methods scRNA-seq data of synovial tissue from LA patients was obtained from the GEO database (GSE233850) and integrated with transcriptome data from our research team’s LA mouse model and the GSE125503 dataset. Multiple analytical strategies, including cell clustering, differential gene analysis, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, pseudotime trajectory analysis, and cell-cell communication analysis, were employed to systematically investigate macrophage characteristics in LA. In vitro experiments using RAW cell lines were conducted to validate the role of key genes in response to Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Results Through single-cell transcriptome analysis of 78,015 cells in the GSE233850 dataset, we identified and annotated 27,843 macrophages, further classifying them into 4 functional subgroups. Differential expression analysis revealed 387 macrophage-specific genes. Cell-cell communication network analysis showed that macrophages interact with other immune cells, including T cells and B cells, through multiple signaling pathways. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in biological processes such as inflammatory response regulation, pathogen recognition, and cytokine signaling. By integrating transcriptome data from our team’s LA mouse model and the GSE125503 dataset, we screened and validated three potential diagnostic marker genes (SIRPB1C, FABP5, and PEPD). In vitro experiments using the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line showed significant expression changes in these genes following Borrelia burgdorferi stimulation (P < 0.05). Conclusion This study provides the first systematic characterization of macrophage transcriptome in the LA synovial microenvironment, revealing their functional heterogeneity and identifying potential diagnostic markers, offering new targets for targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are small-molecule therapeutics that reduce inflammation in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases by modulating the JAK-STAT pathway. While effective in alleviating immune-mediated conditions, JAK inhibitors can impair antiviral defences by suppressing interferon (IFN) responses, potentially increasing susceptibility to viral infections. This study investigates the pro-viral mechanism of JAK inhibitors, focusing on baricitinib, across various cell lines, retinal organoids, and viral strains, including a recombinant IFN-sensitive Rift Valley fever (rRVFV), influenza A (rIAV), SARS-CoV-2 (rSARSCoV-2) reporter viruses, and wild type adenovirus (AdV). Our findings demonstrate that baricitinib suppresses transcription of IFN-stimulated genes in non-infected cells (ISGs) which is triggered by type I IFNs produced by infected cells, facilitating viral propagation. The pro-viral effects were influenced by viral load, inhibitor concentration, and structural characteristics of the compound. These results underscore the dual effects of JAK inhibitors: reducing inflammation while potentially exacerbating viral infections. Additionally, the findings highlight opportunities to leverage JAK inhibitors for viral research, vaccine production, and drug screening.">

        <tr id="Hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the non-coding region of the gene C9orf72 is the most prevalent mutation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. The C9orf72 HRE contributes to motor neuron degeneration in ALS both through cell-autonomous mechanisms and non-cell autonomous disease processes involving glial cells such as microglia. The molecular mechanisms by which C9orf72 HRE microglia contribute to motor neuron death in ALS remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we generated microglia from human C9orf72 HRE and isogenic iPSCs using three different microglia derivation methods that can generate microglia with distinct intrinsic inflammatory profiles. RNA sequencing analysis reveals a consistent dysregulation of specific genes involved in pathways underlying NLRP3 inflammasome activation in C9orf72 HRE microglia independent of priming with any activating cues. In agreement with elevated expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, conditioned media from C9orf72 HRE microglia enhance the death of C9orf72 HRE motor neurons implicating microglia-secreted molecules in non-cell autonomous mechanisms of C9orf72 HRE pathology. These findings provide evidence that C9orf72 HRE microglia have a cell-autonomous pro-inflammatory phenotype that contributes to non-cell autonomous mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS through dysregulated expression of specific genes involved in NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated mechanisms.">

We developed a congenic C57BL/6J line with defined regions of non-C57BL/6J genomic DNA, increased postnatal viability and reduced incidence of HC. Both perinatal lethality and HC were eliminated in F2 mice following outcross of the congenic line to CBA/J or BALBc/J backgrounds. To assess the impacts of microglial deficiency in postnatal neurodevelopment we analyzed deep total RNA-seq data from multiple brain regions of wild-type and Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mice. Aside from the loss of microglial-specific transcripts, we found no significant alterations in relative abundance of any cell-type or region-specific transcriptomic signature. Transcripts associated with endosome/lysosome function, which are enriched in microglia, were not affected, suggesting compensatory expression by other cell types. On the C57BL/6J x CBA/J F2 background, congenital absence of microglia did not affect motor activity, behavior or myelination up to 7 months of age but was associated with astrocytosis and calcification in the thalamus. In the congenic C57BL/6J Csf1rΔFIRE/ΔFIRE mouse line, intraperitoneal transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning led to complete repopulation of the brain with microglia-like cells without giving rise to monocytic intermediates. Our results suggest novel strategies for treatment of microglial deficiency.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 infection is characterized by excessive inflammatory responses, hypercoagulation, and microvascular dysfunction. However, limited research has investigated the effects of co-infections on these characteristics in COVID-19 patients. This study aims to explore how co-infections influence inflammation, hypercoagulability, and microvascular dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and to assess their impact on disease progression.This was a retrospective cohort study involving 630 COVID-19 inpatients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at Xi’an Ninth Hospital. The patients were categorized into two groups: a severe group (n = 176) and a mild group (n = 454). Additionally, they were further subdivided into a co-infected (n = 106) group and a non-co-infected group (n=524) based on the presence or absence of co-infections. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were analyzed and compared between the groups.In the co-infected group, 60 patients (56.6%) were classified as severe cases, and 15 (14.2%) died. By comparison, in the non-co-infected group, 97 patients (18.5%) were severe cases, with 4 (0.8%) deaths. The severity and mortality rates were significantly higher in co-infected patients compared to those non-co-infections. The severe and co-infected groups exhibited significantly higher levels of inflammatory cells, inflammatory factors, coagulation biomarkers, and myocardial injury markers compared to the mild and non-co-infected groups. Conversely, lymphocyte counts, RBC counts, HGB, HCT, TP, and ALB levels were significantly lower in the severe and co-infected groups than in the mild and non-co-infected groups. Furthermore, a notable positive correlation was observed among inflammatory factors, coagulation function, and myocardial injury biomarkers in COVID-19 patients.Co-infections in COVID-19 patients can trigger severe inflammatory responses. This excessive inflammation may lead to coagulation disorders and myocardial injury, all of which are key contributors to disease progression and deterioration. Therefore, implementing infection prevention measures to minimize the spread of co-infections among hospitalized COVID-19 patients is crucial.">

Under steady-state conditions, alveolar macrophages (AlvMϕ) fulfill a multitude of tasks in order to maintain tissue homeostasis. Due to their anatomic localization within the deep lung, AlvMϕ are prone to detect and react to inhaled viruses and thus play a role in the early pathogenesis of several respiratory viral infections. Here, detection of viral pathogens causes diverse antiviral and proinflammatory reactions. This fact not only makes them promising research targets, but also suggests them as potential targets for therapeutic and prophylactic approaches. This review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge about the role of AlvMϕ in respiratory viral infections of humans and animals.">

        <tr id="Generation of reactive oxygen species is an important part of the innate immune response. Generating microbicidal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) requires adaptation of mucosal barriers. High tolerance of ROS provides improved innate immune defenses against pathogens, whereas low tolerance renders host cells prone to chronic toxicity and mutagenesis, which can promote inflammation (e.g., in asthma and Crohn’s disease) and cancerogenesis. The mechanisms that sense and mediate host tolerance to ROS are little understood. In this study, we discover an unexpected role for the redox-sensitive, chemokine-like lipid 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-KETE) in redox adaptation. 5-KETE is known to attract leukocytes to damaged/infected mucosal barriers by signaling through its receptor, OXER1. Suggestive of a distinct non-immune function, we here report that the loss of the OXER1 ortholog Hcar1-4 causes barrier defects and baseline inflammation in the intestine of live zebrafish larvae. In zebrafish and cultured human cells, OXER1 signaling protects against oxidative nucleotide lesions by inducing DNA-protective Nudix hydrolases. Our data reveal the oxoeicosanoid pathway as a conserved ROS resilience mechanism that fortifies pathogen-exposed mucosal linings against increased oxidative stress in vivo.">

        <tr id="The immune status of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in different stages of infection remains difficult to determine. In this study, we performed high-throughput single-cell mass cytometry on peripheral blood samples from 10 COVID-19 patients and four healthy donors to analyze their immune status at acute and convalescence phases. During the acute stage, the proportion of neutrophils increased significantly while natural killer (NK) cells decreased. In contrast, during the convalescence phase, the proportion of plasma cells decreased from the acute stage of disease onset and was lower than normal. The proportions of B, mast and plasma cell subsets decreased significantly with the process of disease recovery. Further analysis of the subsets of major immune cell types in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations in different stages showed that in the acute stages of disease progression, the T helper cell 1 (Th1), IgD+ B and neutrophil subsets increased in COVID-19 patients, especially in symptomatic patients, while the central memory CD4+T cells (CD4 TCM), mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) and NK cell subsets decreased significantly, especially in symptomatic patients. Then CD4 TCM and MAIT returned to normal levels at the recovery phase. Dynamic assessment displayed that the immune imbalance at the onset of COVID-19 could be corrected during recovery. Our study provides additional information on the immune status of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations in different stages. These findings may provide new insights into COVID-19 immunotherapy and immune intervention.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, but can also spread via sexual contact and from mother to fetus. While often asymptomatic, ZIKV can lead to severe neurological conditions, including microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain–Barré Syndrome in adults. ZIKV can infect placental macrophages and fetal microglia in vivo as well as human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Here, we observed that both human monocytes, and MDM particularly, supported ZIKV replication without evident cytopathicity, with virions accumulating in cytoplasmic vacuoles. We also investigated whether the cytokine-induced polarization of MDMs into M1 or M2 cells affected ZIKV replication. The stimulation of MDMs with pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α) polarized MDMs into M1 cells, significantly reducing ZIKV replication, akin to previous observations with a human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection. In contrast, M2 polarization, induced by interleukin-4, did not affect ZIKV replication in MDMs. M1 polarization selectively reduced the expression of MERTK, a TAM family putative entry receptor, and increased the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) previously associated with the containment of ZIKV infection; of interest, ZIKV infection transiently boosted the expression of some ISGs in M1-MDMs. These findings suggest a dual mechanism of ZIKV restriction in M1-MDMs and highlight potential antiviral strategies targeting innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus 68 (EV-D68) is a non-enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that causes respiratory diseases and acute flaccid myelitis, posing significant threats to human health. However, an effective vaccine remains undeveloped. SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent enzyme, plays a key role in cellular metabolism, but its interaction with NAD+ during viral infections is not well understood. In this study, through a metabolomics analysis, we demonstrate that EV-D68 infection influences cellular metabolism. Additionally, we show that NAD+ inhibits EV-D68 infection both in vivo and in vitro. EV-D68 reduces cellular NAD+ levels by regulating the expression of enzymes involved in NAD+ consumption and synthesis. Moreover, the infection increases the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which inhibits EV-D68 replication in turn. Mechanistically, SIRT1 suppresses EV-D68 5′UTR-mediated translation, and the antiviral effect of SIRT1 on EV-D68 replication is enhanced by NAD+. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical role of NAD+ metabolism in EV-D68 infection and reveal the antiviral potential of SIRT1, providing valuable insights for the development of antiviral strategies.">

These can include blood pressure instability, hyperinflammation, coagulopathies, and neuropsychiatric complaints. The pathogenesis of these features remains unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) binds Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells to initiate infection. We hypothesized that some patients may produce anti-RBD antibodies that resemble ACE2 sufficiently to have ACE2-like catalytic activity, that is they are ACE2-like proteolytic abzymes that may help mediate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and LC. In previous work, we showed that some acute COVID-19 patients had immunoglobulin-associated ACE2-like proteolytic activity, suggesting that some COVID-19 patients indeed produced ACE2-like abzymes. However, it remained unknown whether ACE2-like abzymes were seen only in acute COVID-19 patients or whether ACE2-like abzymes could also be identified in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Here we show that some convalescent COVID-19 patients attending a clinic for patients with persistent pulmonary symptoms also have ACE2-like abzymes and that the presence of ACE2-like catalytic activity correlates with alterations in blood pressure in an exercise test.">

Macrophages in the brain barrier system include microglia in the brain parenchyma, border-associated macrophages at the brain's borders, and recruited macrophages. They are responsible for neural development, maintenance of homeostasis, and orchestrating immune responses. With the rapid exploitation and development of new technologies, there is a deeper understanding of macrophages in the brain barrier system. Here we review the origin, development, important molecules, and functions of macrophages, mainly focusing on microglia and border-associated macrophages. We also highlight some advances in single-cell sequencing and significant cell markers. We anticipate that more advanced methods will emerge to study resident and recruited macrophages in the future, opening new horizons for neuroimmunology and related peripheral immune fields.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The Crohn’s disease-associated adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC) (strain LF82) decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and fragments the epithelial mitochondrial network. Other groups have also reported activation of NF-κB-mediated inflammation and generation of reactive oxygen species in AIEC-LF82 infected epithelia. It remains unclear how these findings integrate over the course of AIEC-LF82 infection and how they influence each other over the course of infection. Aims To characterize the sequence of events following AIEC-LF82 infection in a non-cancer derived epithelial cell model focusing on mitochondrial disruption, cell death, mtDNA release, and inflammatory gene expression. Methods The fetal derived human colon epithelial cell line (FHC) were infected with E. coli-LF82 or the commensal E. coli-HB101 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 or uninfected over the course of various experiments. FHCs were stained with SYTOX green and imaged on a CellCyte X system for 24h to measure cell death or stained with MitoTracker Deep Red and imaged on a spinning disc-confocal microscope for 16h to assess mitochondrial morphology. Also, in fixed-cell preparations mitochondrial networks were imaged by staining with anti-TOMM20 antibodies. Imaging of cytosolic DNA was performed via immunofluorescent staining of mtDNA and the mitochondrial network. As markers of inflammation, CXCL10 and IL-6 mRNA were assessed via qRT-PCR. Results Epithelia infected with E. coli-LF82 but not E. coli-HB101 displayed dramatic fragmentation of their mitochondrial network at 6h (p < 0.0001) (n=6), while SYTOX green imaging revealed significant cell death beginning at 9h (p < 0.001) (n=3). Furthermore, our preliminary data indicates that transcription of inflammatory cytokines including CXCL10, and IL-6 occurs at 8h while cytosolic escape of mtDNA occurs at 6h, after mitochondrial network disruption, but prior to cell death. Conclusions The data begins to unravel the sequence of events in a non-cancer derived epithelium after infection with E. coli-LF82, integrating mitochondrial function, inflammatory gene expression, and cell viability and providing a more fulsome understanding of the course of E. coli-LF82 infection. Together, these data advance understanding of relationship between mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death in the context of a Crohn’s disease-relevant pathobiont, AIEC-LF82.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resultant COVID-19 pneumonia cause significant damage to the airway and lung epithelium. This damage manifests as mucus hypersecretion, pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which often lead to long-term complications collectively referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The airway epithelium, as the first line of defence against respiratory pathogens, depends on airway basal stem cells (BSCs) for regeneration. Alterations in BSCs are associated with impaired epithelial repair and may contribute to the respiratory complications observed in PASC. Given the critical role of BSCs in maintaining epithelial integrity, understanding their alterations in COVID-19 is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the intrinsic properties of BSCs derived from COVID-19 patients and evaluates the modulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Through a combination of functional assessments and transcriptomic profiling, we identified key phenotypic and molecular deviations in COVID-19 patient-derived BSCs, including goblet cell hyperplasia, inflammation and fibrosis, which may underlie their contribution to PASC. Notably, MSC co-culture significantly mitigated these adverse effects, potentially through modulation of the interferon signalling pathway. This is the first study to isolate BSCs from COVID-19 patients in the Chinese population and establish a COVID-19 BSC-based xenograft model. Our findings reveal critical insights into the role of BSCs in epithelial repair and their inflammatory alterations in COVID-19 pathology, with potential relevance to PASC and virus-induced respiratory sequelae. Additionally, our study highlights MSC-based therapies as a promising strategy to address respiratory sequelae and persistent symptoms.">

An ominous turn in the pandemic is the evolving public health crisis emanating from persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated long-term impact. Long COVID or post–COVID syndrome describes protean symptoms that persist at least 3 months after the onset of acute illness and last for at least 2 months in individuals with a history of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Long COVID has become a public health concern. Millions of infected individuals are now facing chronic multi-organ failures, including neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and kidney complications. In general, the cause of long COVID syndrome is unclear but factors such as prolonged activation of immune responses, and viral persistence triggering transcription dysregulation of genes associated with normal thrombotic disease may play a role in cardiovascular complications. Although inflammatory biomarkers are reported in other disorders, it remains unclear whether similar biomarkers are associated with cardiovascular manifestations following COVID. Medications such as sulodexide directed at glycocalyx and coagulation have demonstrated benefits for long COVID in smaller studies. Here, we describe the outcomes of the symposium on the underlying cardiovascular mechanisms of the long COVID.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), involves symptoms or effects that persist for more than 4 weeks after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. One contributing factor to this condition is the disruption in the expression of the antioxidant enzyme Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2 (Nrf2) induced by the COVID-19 infection. Apigenin and related flavonoids, known for their diverse pharmacological activities, including potent antioxidant properties, have emerged as promising candidates for Long COVID-19 therapy. These compounds, particularly apigenin, are recognized for their ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammation, making them potential activators of the Nrf2 pathway. This study aims to predict the activity of apigenin and its related flavonoids as Nrf2 activators using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques, providing insights into their therapeutic potential in managing Long COVID-19. The findings from the molecular modeling analysis indicate that apigenin has a favorable affinity, with a free energy value (ΔG) of −6.40 kcal/mol. Additionally, MD simulation results demonstrate the strong stability of the Keap1-apigenin complex, with an average Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) value below 0.20 nm and the lowest average Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) value of 0.86 nm. Using the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) calculation method, the binding affinity of the Keap1-apigenin complex yields a lower free energy value (ΔG) of −67.039 kJ/mol, consistent with the molecular modeling results. Apigenin also exhibits the ability to inhibit the binding of Nrf2 to the hydrophobic surface of Keap1, with a total energy value of 993.266 kcal/mol and binding affinity value of −1.162 kJ/mol through peptide−receptor docking. In conclusion, the comprehensive results suggest that apigenin has the potential to be a lead compound for developing Nrf2 activators specifically designed for Long COVID-19 therapy.">

        <tr id="Persons living with HIV experience significant metabolic dysregulation, frequently resulting in immune and other cellular dysfunction. However, our understanding of metabolism and its relationship to immunity in the context of HIV remains incompletely understood, especially as it relates to the acute and early chronic phases of HIV infection. Herein, we employed mass spectrometry and a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque model to characterize changes in over 500 plasma metabolites throughout SIV infection. This broad metabolomic approach recapitulated known pathogenic signatures of HIV, such as a perturbed tryptophan/kynurenine ratio, but also identified novel metabolic changes. We observed a general decrease in plasma amino acid concentrations, with the notable exceptions of elevated aspartate and glutamate. Acute infection was marked by a transient increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity, indicating a shift toward anaerobic metabolism. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, defined by the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, was significantly increased in both acute and chronic phases and strongly correlated with viral load. These results provide a comprehensive characterization of metabolic fluctuations during early lentiviral infection, furthering our understanding of the crucial interplay between metabolism and immune response. Our findings highlight systemic metabolic consequences of infection and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention or biomarkers of disease progression.


IMPORTANCE
Despite significant advances in antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV remains a global challenge. Understanding the underlying immune mechanisms is critical for improving HIV control and therapeutic development. Cellular metabolism represents a crucial yet underappreciated area of immune system function. Metabolite availability and metabolic pathway preferences directly influence the functional response capacity of immune cells and are highly dysregulated during HIV infection. To further the understanding of metabolic impacts of HIV infection, we utilized cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based metabolome interrogation to measure over 500 metabolites using an acute simian immunodeficiency virus infection model in rhesus macaques. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights into the dynamic metabolic landscape throughout early infection, revealing both known and novel metabolic signatures. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between metabolism and immunity in lentiviral infections, potentially informing new strategies for early detection, prevention, and treatment of HIV.">

        <tr id="The lung is continuously exposed to pathogens and other noxious environmental stimuli, rendering it vulnerable to damage, dysfunction, and the development of disease. Studies utilizing mouse models of respiratory infection, allergy, fibrosis, and cancer have been critical to reveal mechanisms of disease progression and identify therapeutic targets. However, most studies focused on the mouse lung prioritize the isolation of either immune cells or epithelial cells, rather than both populations concurrently. Here, we describe a method for preparing a comprehensive single-cell suspension of both immune and non-immune populations suitable for flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These populations include epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and a variety of myeloid cell subsets. This protocol entails bronchoalveolar lavage and subsequent inflation of the lungs with dispase. Lungs are then digested in a liberase mixture. This method of processing liberates a variety of diverse cell types and results in a single-cell suspension that does not require manual dissociation against a filter, promoting cell survival and yielding high numbers of live cells for downstream analyses. In this protocol, we also define gating schemes for epithelial and myeloid cell subsets in both naïve and influenza-infected lungs. Simultaneous isolation of live immune and non-immune cells is key for interrogating intercellular crosstalk and gaining a deeper understanding of lung biology in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health issue, infecting over 170 million people worldwide and leading to severe liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The ability of HCV to persist and cause chronic infection is partly due to its evasion of the host’s innate immune responses, particularly those mediated by the RIG-I-MAVS pathway, which is critical for antiviral defense. Studies have shown the crucial role genome sensing of DNA viruses by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) followed cGAMP production and activation of downstream effector STING (stimulator of interferon genes) to induce IFN-β, however it is not understood in RNA viruses specially in HCV infection. In this study, we explored first time the mechanism of the cGAS-STING pathway in the context of HCV infection, specifically using the JFH-1 strain of HCV (genotype 2a). We observed that cGAS expression is significantly upregulated during the early HCV infection, leading to the production of the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which in turn activates STING. This activation results in the significant induction of type I interferon responses, particularly interferon-β (IFN-β), which is essential for mounting an effective antiviral response. Moreover, our results demonstrated the translocation of cGAS and STING with cellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. This suggests that the cGAS-STING pathway is intricately linked with other cellular signaling networks in detecting and responding to HCV infection. Furthermore, knockdown experiments targeting cGAS, STING and RIG-I revealed that these proteins play a crucial role in suppressing HCV replication, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of the cGAS-STING pathway in mediating the innate immune response against HCV. Understanding this pathway’s role in the immune defense against HCV opens up new possibilities for therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing the host’s antiviral immunity and potentially developing new treatments for chronic HCV infection.">

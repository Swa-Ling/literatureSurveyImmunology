        <tr id="At this stage in the COVID-19 pandemic, most infections are "breakthrough" infections that occur in individuals with prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To refine long-term vaccine strategies against emerging variants, we examined both innate and adaptive immunity in breakthrough infections. We performed single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional profiling of primary and breakthrough infections to compare immune responses from unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave. Breakthrough infections were characterized by a less activated transcriptomic profile in monocytes and natural killer cells, with induction of pathways limiting monocyte migratory potential and natural killer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a female-specific increase in transcriptomic and proteomic activation of multiple innate immune cell subsets during breakthrough infections. These insights suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prevents overactivation of innate immune responses during breakthrough infections with discernible sex-specific patterns and underscore the potential of harnessing vaccines in mitigating pathologic immune responses resulting from overactivation.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is accompanied by elevated liver enzymes, and patients with pre‐existing liver conditions experience more severe disease. While it was known that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human hepatocytes, our study determines the mechanism of infection, demonstrates viral replication and spread, and highlights direct hepatocyte damage. Viral replication was readily detectable upon infection of primary human hepatocytes and hepatoma cells with the ancestral SARS‐CoV‐2, Delta, and Omicron variants. Hepatocytes express the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell protease TMPRSS2, and knocking down ACE2 and TMPRSS2 impaired SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Progeny viruses released from infected hepatocytes showed the typical coronavirus morphology by electron microscopy and proved infectious when transferred to fresh cells, indicating that hepatocytes can contribute to virus spread. Importantly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection rapidly induced hepatocyte death in a replication‐dependent fashion, with the Omicron variant showing faster onset but less extensive cell death. C57BL/6 wild‐type mice infected with a mouse‐adapted SARS‐CoV‐2 strain showed high levels of viral RNA in liver and lung tissues. ALT peaked when viral RNA was cleared from the liver. Liver histology revealed profound tissue damage and immune cell infiltration, indicating that direct cytopathic effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 and immune‐mediated killing of infected hepatocytes contribute to liver pathology.">

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations in infants and poses a significantly higher risk of respiratory failure than SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. We analyzed blood samples from infants (median age 2.3 months) with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 30), RSV (n = 19), and healthy controls (n = 17) using single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, and cytokine profiling. Both viruses triggered comparable interferon responses across PBMC subsets but differed in NK cell and inflammatory responses. Severe RSV cases showed reduced NK cell frequencies, lower IFNG expression, and decreased chromatin accessibility at T-BET and EOMES binding sites. RSV infections were also associated with increased CD4+ TEMRA, memory Treg and transitional B cells. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was characterized by stronger pro-inflammatory signatures, including increased NFKB pathway activity and higher serum TNF concentrations. These findings highlight distinct immune responses to RSV and SARS-CoV-2, providing insights that may inform clinical decisions.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that is one of the most significant challenges to public health over the past few years. Most people are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but older adults are more vulnerable. Aging is one of the major risk factors for the detrimental consequences of COVID-19, likely due to chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, both of which are the characteristics of old age. Immunosenescence refers to the weakening of the immune system with age while inflammaging describes the low-grade chronic inflammation seen in older individuals. One key aspect of human aging is immune deficiency. During aging, our body's defense system weakens, resulting in decreased responses to infection by novel pathogens and a reduced ability to become immunized. The presence of chronic inflammation and viral infection in old age may cause several adverse unpredictable outcomes increasing the propensity and severity of the disease and requires to be considered, enabling people to better prepare for the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. This requires consideration so that individuals can better be prepared to address the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. In this review, we discuss the clinical characteristics of elderly COVID-19 patients and survey the associated molecular pathways that are pivotal for the interactions of the coronavirus and host cellular responses, including immunosenescence, inflammation, telomere attrition, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in major aging signaling pathways, which are crucial for the discovery of new therapeutic and preventive methods in the ongoing pandemic.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID‐19 commonly leads to respiratory issues, yet numerous patients also exhibit a diverse range of neurological conditions, suggesting a detrimental impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 or the viral Spike protein on the central nervous system. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Current understanding of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and host responses driving the pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses. Our findings provide a catalog of SARS-CoV-2 host response genes changing over time and magnitude of these host responses were significantly correlated to viral load.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life.

        <tr id="Type I interferons exert their antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including but not limited to LY6E, CH25H, IFITM2/3, and IFIH1. However, the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of action of most ISGs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet fully understood. By screening 109 ISG-knockout cell lines, we identify that phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), an interferon-inducible protein, acts as a crucial restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cells lacking PLSCR1 are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, overexpression of PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depletion of PLSCR1 enhances cellular entry of both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, PLSCR1 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by specifically downregulating plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the virus's receptor, without affecting the overall levels of ACE2 within the cell. As such, we unraveled previously unappreciated mechanisms by which PLSCR1 exerts its restrictive effect on SARS-CoV-2. These data provide new insights into the interplay between host innate antiviral immunity and SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on novel antiviral therapeutics.


IMPORTANCE
Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been identified as a critical host restriction factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we demonstrated that PLSCR1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry by downregulating the plasma membrane expression of ACE2, the primary receptor for viral entry. Our findings elucidate a novel host-pathogen interaction that not only deepens our understanding of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 but offers potential strategies for therapeutic interventions against COVID-19.">

The genetic, immunological, and environmental factors influencing disease severity and post-infection clinical outcomes, known as correlates of immunity, remain largely undefined. Clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to those with life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms. While most infected individuals return to their former health and fitness within a few weeks, some develop debilitating chronic symptoms, referred to as long-COVID. Autoimmune responses have been proposed as one of the factors influencing long-COVID and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between viral infections and autoimmune pathologies is not new. Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, among others, have been shown to induce the production of autoantibodies and the onset of autoimmune conditions. Given the extensive literature on SARS-CoV-2, here we review current evidence on SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmune pathologies, with a focus on autoantibodies. We closely examine mechanisms driving autoantibody production, particularly their connection with disease severity and long-COVID.">

In addition to severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities increase the risk of fatal outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on pre-existing conditions in patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. Recent clinical studies have reported the reactivation of human herpesviruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in severe COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. To support these clinical observations, we established a KSHV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection system in A549-hACE2 cells. Our findings indicate that co-infection with live SARS-CoV-2 sharply induces KSHV lytic reactivation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in global cellular gene expression in KSHV-infected A549-hACE2 cells, both with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. These data provide a molecular basis for understanding whether patients with pre-existing oncogenic herpesvirus infections are at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 or for developing virus-associated cancers even after full recovery from COVID-19.">

The objective of this study is to characterize maternal and cord cytokine profiles of acute SARS-CoV-2 “breakthrough” infection (BTI) after vaccination, compared with unvaccinated infection and uninfected controls. Study design 66 pregnant individuals enrolled in the MGH COVID-19 biorepository (March 2020-April 2022) were included. Maternal sera were collected from 26 unvaccinated and 21 vaccinated individuals with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cord sera were collected at delivery. Maternal and cord sera from 19 term dyads without current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed as controls. Cytokines were quantified using the Human Inflammation 20-Plex ProcartaPlex assay. Results There was a significantly higher incidence of severe/critical maternal illness in unvaccinated pregnant individuals with SARS-CoV-2 compared to vaccinated (10/26 (38%) vs. 0/21 (0%), p<0.01). Significantly higher maternal levels of TNFα and CD62P were observed in vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 BTI compared with unvaccinated individuals with infection (p<0.05). Network correlation analyses revealed a distinct maternal cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals. Neither unvaccinated nor vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in elevated cord cytokines compared to controls. Multivariate analyses demonstrate distinct maternal and cord cytokine profiles in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 at delivery. Conclusion Vaccination was associated with higher maternal cytokine levels during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated infection, which may reflect vaccine-mediated priming of the immune system. A fetal inflammatory response specific to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed.">

Here, we analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication while building an antiviral cellular defense. Our study reveals that miR-155 expression is elevated in patients with COVID-19. Using a mouse model transgenic for human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, we evaluated the potential of anti-miR-155 therapy. Treating SARS-CoV-2-infected mice with anti-miR-155 significantly reduced miR-155 expression, improved survival, and slightly increased body weight. Notably, these mice showed altered expression of cytokines in the lungs. These findings suggest anti-miR-155 could be a promising therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm and long-lasting symptoms induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, improving public health outcomes and enhancing global pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a pathogen that primarily targets the respiratory system and can lead to severe conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, three—SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2—are associated with severe illness and significant morbidity. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cellular entry. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly mutable, leading to the emergence of variants that alter disease pathology and transmission dynamics. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified these mutations into variants of concern (VOCs), variants of interest (VOIs), and variants under monitoring (VUMs). This review provides an in-depth analysis of both historical and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, summarizes recent advancements in diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and discusses current therapeutic strategies for COVID-19, with a particular focus on virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines developed in recent years. Additionally, we highlight ongoing therapeutic approaches and their implications for managing COVID-19.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an RNA virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lungs and airways, it can also infect other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the choroid plexus could serve as a potential entry site for SARS-CoV-2 into the brain. Tissue samples from 24 deceased COVID-19-positive individuals were analyzed. Reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on selected brain regions, including the choroid plexus, to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Additionally, immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy were used to detect and localize two characteristic proteins of SARS-CoV-2: the spike protein S1 and the nucleocapsid protein. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the choroid plexus. Immunohistochemical staining revealed viral particles localized in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, with the spike protein S1 detected in the late endosomes. Our findings suggest that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier in the choroid plexus serves as a route of entry for SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS. This study contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying CNS involvement in COVID-19 and highlights the importance of further research to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting this entry pathway.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 involves several organs, but its basis remains poorly understood. Some infected cells in mice survive the acute infection and persist for extended periods in the respiratory tract but not in other tissues. Here, we describe two experimental models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to assess the effect of viral virulence on previously infected cells. Both approaches use lineage tracking of previously infected cells. In mice infected with a highly pathogenic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) but not alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells survived the acute infection. These cells became activated, differentiated into an AT2-to-AT1 transitional cell state (KRT8+ pre-alveolar type 1 transitional cell state). Additionally, nearby uninfected AT2 cells upregulated the transitional marker KRT8, thereby contributing to lung regeneration. In mice sensitized to infection by transduction with Ad5-hACE2, the infection is nonlethal, and AT1 cells survived the infection. Consequently, recovery in these mice was more rapid. Taken together, these results provide an explanation for how SARS-CoV-2 virulence contributes to poor outcomes and affects clinical recovery and lung regeneration. We also identified a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts lung recovery, even at times when infectious virus cannot be detected.


IMPORTANCE
A major consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is that many survivors have long-term sequelae, which are not well understood. These involve many organs, with the respiratory tract being a common site of long-term effects. Many of these sequelae can be found in mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we have focused on the lungs, with particular interest in the fate and role of cells that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and survived the acute infection. We found that some infected cells survive acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that these surviving cells both contribute to the immune response in the lungs and are involved in lung recovery. These findings illustrate previously unexplored aspects of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia and may be relevant for understanding aspects of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The reaction of different cell types to prion infections is highly heterogeneous. While neurons experience spine retraction and eventually death, astrocytes and microglia undergo strong activation and proliferation. Here we analyzed the cell-type specific responses to prion diseases by establishing a spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of mice infected with RML prion strain. Brain areas with severe neuronal loss, such as the thalamus and cerebellum, experienced intense microgliosis. Starting from 30 weeks post-inoculation, we observed the accumulation of a novel microglial subpopulation characterized by strong expression of Gpnmb in these brain regions. The molecular profile of Gpnmb+ microglia reflected a state of enhanced phagocytic activity with upregulation of genes associated with lysosomal function and degradation, including vacuolar ATPase V0 domain subunit d2 (Atp6v0d2) and Galectin-3 (Lgals3). In microglial-like, murine BV2 cells, Gpnmb upregulation was induced by soluble find-me signals released during apoptosis, but not by apoptotic bodies or prion accumulation. Gpnmb ablation in BV2 cells impaired their ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells, underscoring its essential role in maintaining microglial phagocytosis. Our findings define Gpnmb⁺ microglia as a distinct, apoptosis-driven phagocytic state, linking neuronal loss to microglial activation in prion disease. The upregulation of GPNMB in sCJD patients, along with its role in apoptotic clearance and lysosomal function, positions it as both a key regulator of microglial responses and a potential biomarker of disease progression.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus responsible for COVID-19, interacts with the host immune system through complex mechanisms that significantly influence disease outcomes, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. These interactions are crucial in determining the disease's severity and the host's ability to clear the virus. Given the virus's substantial socioeconomic impact, high morbidity and mortality rates, and public health importance, understanding these mechanisms is essential. This article examines the diverse innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2's structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, along with nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open reading frames. These proteins play pivotal roles in immune modulation, facilitating viral replication, evading immune detection, and contributing to severe inflammatory responses such as cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus employs strategies like suppressing type I interferon production and disrupting key antiviral pathways, including MAVS, OAS-RNase-L, and PKR. This study also explores the immune pathways that govern the activation and suppression of immune responses throughout COVID-19. By analyzing immune sensing receptors and the responses initiated upon recognizing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, this review elucidates the complex pathways associated with the innate immune response in COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for therapeutic interventions and informs public health strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has been associated with significant cardiovascular complications, including fibrosis, functional impairment, and chronic inflammatory and immune responses. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these cardiac pathologies following COVID-19 infection remain understudied. Previously, we characterized a mouse model of long COVID and observed enhanced expression of kinin B1 receptor (B1R) in the infected animals. Here, we investigated the role of B1R in mediating long COVID induced cardiac pathologies. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated at 28 days post-infection (dpi) to model long COVID and the effects of pharmacological blockade of B1R were evaluated. Persistent upregulation of B1R expression was accompanied by apoptosis, disrupted cardiomyocyte architecture, fibrosis, impaired gap junction integrity, and sustained inflammation and immune cell infiltration. B1R blockade restored gap junction integrity, reduced fibrosis and apoptosis, and mitigated inflammation and immune activation. Together, these data indicate that B1R plays a critical role in long COVID induced cardiac remodeling and damage, highlighting its potential as a target for treating long-lasting cardiovascular complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the myocardium of the left ventricle and the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in deceased COVID-19 patients. We conducted a post-mortem examination on 91 individuals who succumbed to COVID-19-related complications. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the myocardium of the left ventricle was analyzed reverse transcription real time PCR (RT-qPCR) (EliGene® COVID19 UKV/SAV RT kit, Elisabeth Pharmacon), and antibody levels in serum were analyzed by serological assays (VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgM and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG II tests, BioMérieux). Of the heart tissue samples, 44 % tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our findings indicate that any detectable level of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 reduces the risk of viral penetration into the myocardium by more than fourfold. Specifically, individuals with detectable levels of IgG and IgM antibodies exhibited a significantly reduced presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiac tissues (p<0.0001 for IgG and p<0.001 for IgM). Notably, all patients who died from pulmonary embolism had elevated levels of IgG antibodies. The study underscores the protective role of IgG and IgM antibodies in preventing SARS-CoV-2 penetration into cardiac tissues. However, high antibody titers were associated with fatal outcomes such as pulmonary embolism, pointing to the intricate balance of immune response in COVID-19 pathology.

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Several respiratory viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), suppress nuclear factor‐E2‐related factor‐2 (NRF2) antioxidant response, generating oxidative stress conditions to its advantage. NRF2 has also been reported to regulate the innate immune response through the inhibition of the interferon (IFN) pathway. However, its modulation in younger individuals and its correlation with the IFN response remain to be elucidated. Methods The NRF2 and redox‐related genes expression was examined in nasopharyngeal swabs from children attending the pediatric hospital for SARS‐CoV‐2 molecular testing. Expression levels were analyzed by stratifying the population according to the SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity, age, or the presence of symptoms. The results were correlated with Types I and III IFN genes and IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Results We found that NRF2 expression was markedly diminished in positive patients compared to negative. Moreover, it correlated with higher expression of IFNα2 and IFNλ3, as well as ISG15 and ISG56. Interestingly, symptomatic patients with anosmia/ageusia showed pronounced expression of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease1/redox factor 1 (APE1), together with Type I IFNs, ISG56, and the inflammasome component NLRP3. Conclusion The results indicate an interdependence between NRF2 antioxidant pathway and IFN‐mediated response during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in young subjects.">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

Understanding the mechanisms of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for addressing COVID-19–related liver pathology and developing targeted therapies. This editorial discusses the significance of ACE2 in hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, drawing on the research by Jacobs et al. Their findings indicate that hepatic ACE2 expression, frequency of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and severity of liver injury are elevated in patients with pre-existing chronic liver diseases.

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes pulmonary edema, which disrupts the lung alveoli–capillary barrier and leads to pulmonary cell apoptosis, the main cause of death. However, the molecular mechanism behind SARS-CoV-2’s apoptotic activity remains unknown. Here, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a mediates the pulmonary pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is demonstrated by the fact that it causes lung tissue damage. The in vitro results showed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a triggers cell death via the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, which is modulated through the regulation of Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive Potassium Channel (MitoKATP). The addition of exogenous Potassium (K+) in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis along with the inflammatory interferon response (IFN-β) triggered by SARS-ORF-3a. The addition of exogenous K+ strongly suggests that dysregulation of K+ ion channel function is the central mechanism underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction and stress response induced by SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a. Our results designate that targeting the potassium channel or its interactions with ORF-3a may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the damaging effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, particularly low-density neutrophils (LDNs), are believed to contribute to acute COVID-19 severity. Here, we showed that neutrophilia can be detected acutely and even months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and mice, while neutrophil depletion reduced disease severity in mice. A key factor in neutrophilia and severe disease in infected mice was traced to the chemokine CXCL12 secreted by bone marrow cells and unexpectedly, endothelial cells. CXCL12 levels were negatively correlated with LDN numbers in longitudinal analyses of patient blood samples. CXCL12 blockade in SARS-CoV-2–infected mice increased blood/lung neutrophil numbers, thereby accelerating disease progression without changing lung virus titers. The exaggerated mortality caused by CXCL12 blockade could be reversed by neutrophil depletion. In addition, blocking interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reduced CXCL12 levels, suggesting a signal transduction from virus-mediated ACE2 ligation to increased CXCL12 secretion. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of CXCL12 in diminishing neutrophilia, including low-density neutrophilia, and its deleterious effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results also support the involvement of SARS-CoV-2–endothelial cell interactions in viral pathogenesis.">

Notably, B cell and CD4+ T cell responses were positively correlated with high viral variability, while CD8+ T cell responses showed a negative correlation. This study identified highly conserved and evolutionarily constrained SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, which could be crucial for broad-spectrum vaccine development.

        <tr id="Monocytes and macrophages, as important constituents of the innate immune system, are equipped with multiple Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) to recognize invading pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, and mount an antiviral response. Nevertheless, their uncontrolled activation can lead to hyperinflammation seen in severe COVID-19. Surprisingly, we observed that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins triggered only a weak proinflammatory response in human peripheral blood monocytes. By employing THP-1 and Jurkat NF-κB::eGFP reporter cell lines expressing specific TLRs, various TLR ligands and blocking antibodies, we determined that surface TLRs, including TLR2/1, TLR2/6 and TLR4 do not play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 sensing. However, monocytes are potently activated by the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, and the response correlates with the viral uptake that is observed only in monocytes, but not in lymphocytes. We show that monocyte activation involves two distinct steps. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes in a process independent of the S protein and the prime SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Instead, the alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor CD147, which is highly expressed on monocytes, recognizes its well-known interaction partners cyclophilins A and B that are incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 virions. Secondly, upon viral uptake via the cyclophilin-CD147 interaction, that can be inhibited by specific CD147 blocking antibodies or competition with recombinant human cyclophilin A and B, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recognized by TLR7/8 in endosomes, leading to upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, comprising the core hyperinflammatory signature. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism how human monocytes sense SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting the cyclophilin-CD147 axis might be beneficial to alleviate overt myeloid-driven inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Since late 2021, Omicron variants have dominated the epidemiological scenario as the most successful severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sublineages, driving new and breakthrough infections globally over the past two years. In this study, we investigated for the first time the host salivary response of COVID-19 patients infected with Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5) by using an untargeted four-dimensional data-independent acquisition (4D-DIA)-based proteomics approach. We identified 137 proteins whose abundance levels differed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups. Salivary signatures were mainly enriched in ribosomal proteins, linked to mRNAviral translation, protein synthesis and processing, immune innate, and antiapoptotic signaling. The higher abundance of 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAG, YWHAQ, YWHAE, and SFN) in saliva, first reported here, may be associated with increased infectivity and improved viral replicative fitness. We also identified seven proteins (ACTN1, H2AC2, GSN, NDKA, CD109, GGH, and PCYOX) that yielded comprehension into Omicron infection and performed outstandingly in screening patients with COVID-19 in a hospital setting. This panel also presented an enhanced anti-COVID-19 and anti-inflammatory signature, providing insights into disease severity, supported by comparisons with other proteome data sets. The salivary signature provided valuable insights into the host’s response to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection, shedding light on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, particularly in cases associated with mild disease. It also underscores the potential clinical applications of saliva for disease screening in hospital settings. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD054133.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the respiratory system and other organ systems. Tissue injuries resulting from viral infection and host hyperinflammatory responses may lead to moderate to severe pneumonia, systemic complications, and even death. While anti-inflammatory agents have been used to treat patients with severe COVID-19, their therapeutic effects are limited. GPR4 (G protein-coupled receptor 4) is a pro-inflammatory receptor expressed on vascular endothelial cells, regulating leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a GPR4 antagonist, NE-52-QQ57, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Our results demonstrated that GPR4 antagonist treatment increased the survival rate in this severe COVID-19 mouse model. The inflammatory response, characterized by proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was reduced in the GPR4 antagonist group compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, both SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers and infectious viral titers in the mouse lung were decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive mouse brains was also decreased in the GPR4 antagonist group compared to the vehicle group. Furthermore, the GPR4 antagonist inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero E6 cells. Together, these results suggest that GPR4 antagonism may be explored as a novel approach for the treatment of COVID-19 and other similar viral diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has profoundly impacted global health, with pneumonia emerging as a major complication in severe cases. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is marked by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an excessive inflammatory response, resulting in oxidative stress and significant tissue damage, particularly in the respiratory system. Antioxidants have garnered considerable attention for their potential role in managing COVID-19 pneumonia by mitigating oxidative stress and modulating immune responses. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the use of antioxidants in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Studies exploring antioxidants, including vitamins, trace elements, nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), glutathione (GSH), L-carnitine, melatonin, bromelain, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and numerous polyphenols, have yielded promising outcomes. Through their ROS-scavenging properties, these molecules support endothelial function, reduce the thrombosis risk, and may help mitigate the effects of the cytokine storm, a key contributor to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Clinical evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation may improve patient outcomes by decreasing inflammation, supporting immune cell function, and potentially shortening recovery times. Furthermore, these molecules may mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19 by exerting direct antiviral effects that inhibit the infection process and genomic replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Moreover, antioxidants may work synergistically with standard antiviral treatments to reduce viral-induced oxidative damage. By integrating findings from the literature with real-world data from our clinical experience, we gain a more profound understanding of the role of antioxidants in managing COVID-19 pneumonia. Further research combining comprehensive literature reviews with real-world data analysis is crucial to validate the efficacy of antioxidants and establish evidence-based guidelines for their use in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="The early immune kinetics after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remain poorly understood, particularly among individuals with low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBLlo). We investigated the cellular and humoral kinetics in the blood of 50 non-MBL healthy donors (HD) vs. 16 MBLlo subjects after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, who were subclassified according to their history of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 into SARS-CoV-2 naïve and previously infected subjects. Overall, we found decreased neutrophil and lymphocyte counts at day +4 following each dose in non-MBL HD, together with an earlier and higher increase in plasma cell (PC) counts and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels after the first vaccine in previously infected non-MBL HD. MBLlo subjects showed a similar profile, except for lower B-cell and higher PC counts after vaccination, and a trend towards a higher (but delayed) antibody response. In summary, we found different cell-kinetic profiles following vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 naïve vs. previously infected non-MBL HD (earlier PC and antibody responses in the latter group); additionally, MBLlo subjects had significantly lower B-cell and higher PC counts after vaccination, and a delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

        <tr id="While Influenza Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are considered as a significant health burden in children, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes milder diseases in this age group compared to adults. To investigate the involvement of the upper respiratory tract human airway epithelium (HAE) in this pattern, we established an in-house model of reconstituted HAE cultured in air-liquid interface from nasal swabs of children and adults and characterised it before and after ex vivo respiratory viral infections using focused and unbiased approaches. Fully differentiated paediatric HAE exhibited an increasing induction level of genes related to mucociliary clearance, while higher expression of innate immune pathways was found in the ones from adults. While similar viral replication kinetics in both age groups were shown for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A Virus (IAV), RSV and Rhinovirus (RV) infection, transcriptomic analysis showed stronger and earlier induction of IFN-related pathways in SARS-CoV-2-infected HAE from children compared to IAV, RSV and RV. IAV and RSV had the weakest innate immune response increase in HAE from children versus adults. RV infection showed an intermediate pattern, resembling SARS-CoV-2 more than RSV or IAV. Our work demonstrates a distinct sensing of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses ex vivo, which may contribute to the milder course of disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected children and argues for a role of early virus-HAE interaction in shaping viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that innate immune responses towards respiratory viruses are virus-specific and differ between age groups. Hence, findings on SARS-CoV-2 cannot be extrapolated to other respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunocompromised patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often have prolonged viral shedding, and some are clinically suspected of reinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, data on this issue are limited. This study investigated the SARS-CoV-2 variants in serially collected respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients with prolonged viral shedding for over 12 weeks or relapsed viral shedding after at least 2 weeks of viral clearance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From February 2022 to September 2023, we prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who had hematologic malignancies or had undergone transplantation and were admitted to a tertiary hospital. Weekly saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from enrolled patients for at least 12 weeks after diagnosis. Genomic RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on samples, and those testing positive underwent viral culture to isolate the live virus. Spike gene full sequencing via Sanger sequencing and real-time reverse transcription-PCR for detecting mutation genes were conducted to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants.


RESULTS
Among 116 enrolled patients, 20 with prolonged or relapsed viral shedding were screened to identify the variants. Of these 20 patients, 7 (35%) exhibited evidence of re-infection; one of 8 patients with prolonged viral shedding and 6 of 12 with relapsed viral shedding were reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that approximately one-third of immunocompromised patients with persistent or relapsed viral shedding had reinfection with different variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Compromised male reproductive health, including reduced testosterone and sperm count, is one of the long COVID symptoms in individuals recovering from mild-severe disease. COVID-19 patients display testicular injury in the acute stage and altered serum fertility markers in the recovery phase, however, long-term implications on the testis remain unknown. This study characterized the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on testis function. The K18-hACE2 mice that survived SARS-CoV-2 infection were followed for one month after infection and the testicular injury and function markers were assessed at different stages of infection and recovery. The long-term impact of infection on key testes function-related hormones and male fertility was measured. The efficacy of inflammation-suppressing drug in preventing testicular injury was also evaluated. The morphological defects like sloughing of spermatids into the lumen and increased apoptotic cells sustained for 2–4 weeks after infection and correlated with testicular inflammation and immune cell infiltration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of inflammatory, cell death, and steroidogenic pathways. Furthermore, reduced testosterone levels associated with a transient reduction in sperm count and male fertility. Most testicular impairments resolved within one month of infection. Importantly, dexamethasone treatment attenuated testicular damage, inflammation, and immune infiltration. Our results implicate virus-induced cytokine storm as the major driver of testicular injury and functional impairments, timely prevention of which limits testis damage. These findings serve as a model for evaluating therapeutics in long COVID patients and may guide clinical strategies to improve male reproductive health outcomes post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is associated with neurological effects that persist beyond the acute phase, collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “long COVID.” This article discusses the neurological impacts of PASC, which can occur regardless of the initial illness’s severity. Studies indicate that most patients continue to experience symptoms for at least 3 months post-infection. Long-term effects include neurocognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. Proposed mechanisms underlying these effects include neuroinflammation, microvascular damage, and autoimmune responses, while direct viral neuroinvasion remains a topic of ongoing debate. SARS-CoV-2 may also worsen pre-existing neurological disorders and increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease. The article highlights the need for longitudinal studies to better understand the variability in outcomes and the mechanisms driving these persistent effects. In addition, it explores the inflammatory pathways linking long COVID to AD. Both conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation, activation of shared markers such as the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome, and alterations in amyloid-beta production. The apolipoprotein E4 gene, a known risk factor for AD, is also associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Neuroimaging studies reveal brain changes in COVID-19 survivors, particularly in regions related to cognition and memory, further emphasizing the need for long-term research to assess the potential role of long COVID in exacerbating neurodegenerative diseases.">

 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. However, SARS-CoV-2 chiefly infects lungs through the binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) expressed on the alveolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, the intestinal epithelial cells also express ACE2 receptors. Not only has the SARS-CoV-2 been detected in nasopharyngeal and mid-nasal samples, but also it seems SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found in the feces of infectious patients. In fact, fecal samples of patients contain RNA of the virus. The intensity of COVID-19 has mainly been associated with aging and comorbidities. Older patients experience a decline in the alteration of the gut microbiome, and COVID-19 has proven to be most fatal in this age group, further emphasizing the potential critical role of gut microbiota in this disease. The lung was formerly believed to be a sterile area free from bacteria. However, the lung microbiome has received more attention due to its recent link to several respiratory illnesses and immunity. In this review article, data from COVID-19 research and gut–lung cross-talk in the prognosis of COVID-19 disease and explored the bidirectional impacts of it on the gut–lung axis microbiome were discussed.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are significant 21st-century pandemics with distinct virological and clinical characteristics. COVID-19 primarily presents as an acute respiratory illness, while HIV leads to chronic immune suppression. Understanding their differences can enhance public health strategies and treatment approaches. Purpose This narrative review compares the virology, transmission, immune responses, and clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV to inform treatment strategies and public health interventions. Methods A narrative review was conducted, synthesizing data from peer-reviewed literature and expert commentary from 2010 to 2024. Databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies. Results SARS-CoV-2 primarily spreads through airborne droplets and contaminated surfaces, while HIV transmits through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 involves both innate and adaptive systems, potentially leading to a cytokine storm in severe cases. In contrast, HIV evades the immune system by integrating into host cells, resulting in chronic infection and progressive immune deterioration. Treatment for SARS-CoV-2 focuses on symptom management and prevention, with antiviral medications and vaccines playing crucial roles. Conversely, HIV treatment relies on antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress viral replication and maintain immune function. Conclusion The review highlights the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 versus the chronic progression of HIV. Tailored prevention and treatment strategies are essential for effective disease management. Recommendations Public health strategies should address the unique transmission routes and progression of both viruses. Further research into vaccine development and therapeutic interventions is critical for improving disease management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection in the placenta can lead to fetal distress and demise, characterized by severe trophoblast necrosis, chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI), and massive perivillous fibrin deposition. We aimed to uncover spatial immune‐related protein changes in SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis compared with CHI placentas and uncomplicated pregnancies to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Placentas were retrospectively collected from cases with SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis resulting in fetal distress/demise (n = 9), CHI (n = 9), and uncomplicated term controls (n = 9). The expression of 53 immune‐related proteins was quantified using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler in three separate compartments: villi (fetal compartment), intervillous space, and decidua (both maternal compartments). Compared with controls, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis and CHI both displayed differentially expressed proteins in the intervillous space only, including upregulation of myeloid markers (e.g., CD40, CD11c, CD68, CD163). Specifically, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis was associated with reduced expression of multiple apoptotic proteins (e.g., BAD, BIM, BLXL, BCL6). In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis and CHI are associated with enhanced myeloid cell infiltration into the intervillous space, but not in the decidua and villi. The more prominently reduced apoptosis‐related protein expression in SARS‐CoV‐2 placentitis may lead to an exaggerated immune response, causing acute placental dysfunction and fetal demise.">

        <tr id="Although emerging data have revealed the critical role of memory CD8+ T cells in preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its memory and innate-like subsets in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with various disease manifestations in an HLA-restricted fashion remain to be understood. Here, we show the strong association of protective cellular immunity with mild COVID-19 and unique cell types against SARS-CoV-2 virus in an HLA-A2 restricted manner. ELISpot assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in mild COVID-19 patients are significantly higher than in severe patients, whereas neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly correlate with disease severity. Single-cell analyses of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cells, which recognize highly conserved immunodominant SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, demonstrate divergent profiles in unvaccinated patients with mild versus severe disease. CD8+ T-cell types including cytotoxic KLRB1+ CD8αα cells with innate-like T-cell signatures, IFNGhiID3hi memory cells and IL7R+ proliferative stem cell-like memory cells are preferentially observed in mild COVID-19, whereas distinct terminally-differentiated T-cell subsets are predominantly detected in severe COVID-19: highly activated FASLhi T-cell subsets and early-terminated or dysfunctional IL4R+ GATA3+ stem cell-like memory T-cell subset. In conclusion, our findings suggest that unique and contrasting SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell profiles may dictate COVID-19 severity. Graphical abstract.

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has challenged the scientific and medical community since its emergence. Understanding the immunopathogenic events that occur during infection is crucial to developing effective treatment and prevention strategies.Objective: To synthesize the immunological aspects in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019.Development: SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the entry of the virus into host cells through the ACE2 receptor. Once inside, the virus induces an immune response. In the early stages, the innate immune response is activated, which includes the release of interferons and cytokines. However, in some patients, this response becomes deregulated, triggering a cytokine storm that contributes to systemic inflammation and lung damage. T and B cells also play a crucial role; although the activation of CD8+ T cells can help control the infection, their depletion in severe cases has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Immunopathogenic events in COVID-19 are complex and can lead to diverse clinical outcomes. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for the development of targeted therapies and effective vaccines. Continued research is critical to improving our response to future pandemics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background The global pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in millions of people experiencing long COVID condition, a range of persistent symptoms following the acute phase, with an estimated prevalence of 27%–64%. Materials and Methods To understand its pathophysiology, we conducted a longitudinal study on viral load and cytokine dynamics in individuals with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We used reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR to quantify viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and employed multiplex technology to measure plasma cytokine levels in a cohort of people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Our study included individuals with long COVID condition and those without, all of whom had at least three nasopharyngeal and plasma samples collected within 55 days after diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results Individuals affected with long COVID symptoms had delayed viral clearance and lower viral loads at diagnosis compared to those without symptoms. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed variations in IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10 levels, with delayed normalization in individuals affected by long COVID syndrome. Correlation analysis indicated associations between viral load and IP‐10 and interrelations among cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐18, MIG, and IP‐10. Conclusion Our study provides insights into the association between nasopharyngeal viral load, cytokine dynamics, and the development of long COVID syndrome, providing an early signature of this condition.">

        <tr id="The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor antibodies as a therapeutic agent to combat severe COVID-19. Given the constant evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, the study aims to assess the potential of these inhibitors in adapting to new challenges and improving treatment outcomes. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was conducted using electronic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The study analyzed the role of IL-6 inhibitors in combating SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their therapeutic potential in treating severe COVID-19 cases, particularly in controlling the overshooting immune response associated with cytokine storms. IL-6 inhibitors proved to be versatile and effective in attenuating severe immune responses, especially cytokine storms, which are common in advanced COVID-19 cases. The literature emphasizes their ability to regulate the immune system, reduce disease severity, and improve patient outcomes. Their efficacy in controlling the immune response and reducing disease severity makes IL-6 inhibitor antibodies a promising therapeutic strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants. Further research is needed to optimize their use and adaptability in evolving clinical scenarios.">

        <tr id="The common cold coronaviruses are a source of ongoing morbidity and mortality particularly among elderly and immunocompromised individuals. While cross-reactive immune responses against multiple coronaviruses have been described following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination, it remains unclear if these confer any degree of cross-protection against the common cold coronaviruses. A recombinant fowl adenovirus vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (FAdV-9-S19) was generated, and protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge was shown in K18-hACE2 mice. Vaccinated mice were also challenged with the common cold coronaviruses human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 by the intranasal route, and viral shedding and lung burden were reduced in these groups compared to unvaccinated animals. Histopathological analysis of lung tissues revealed significantly less inflammation and lower pathology scores in mice that received FAdV-9-S19 . Because no mouse model for the coronavirus HCoV-229E exists, we vaccinated and challenged cynomolgus macaques to evaluate cross-protection against HCoV-229E. Animals were monitored for clinical signs of disease and viral shedding. Infectious virus was detected in both groups throughout the course of infection; however, vaccinated animals showed reduced viral shedding at multiple time points after infection. Histopathological analysis of lung tissues following challenge also indicated a more moderate disease in the vaccinated animals. Therefore, vaccination with FAdV-9-S19 also provided a moderate cross-protection against HCoV-229E disease in the cynomolgus macaques infection model. Our study demonstrates that vaccination with a recombinant fowl adenovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can provide a low-level cross-protection against beta- and alphacoronaviruses. These findings are important for the design of future pan-coronavirus vaccines.IMPORTANCEThe common cold coronaviruses are a source of ongoing morbidity and mortality particularly among elderly and immunocompromised individuals, and no vaccine is currently available. Cross-reactive immune responses have been described following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination; however, it remains unclear what degree of cross-protection they confer against the common cold coronaviruses. We demonstrate that both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses provide a low-level cross-protection, resulting in reduced viral load and pathology for the common cold coronaviruses OC43 and NL63 in mouse models. Additionally, we present a novel non-human primate (NHP) model of infection with the common cold coronavirus 229E, demonstrating that it mimics the disease observed in humans and can serve as a model for future vaccine studies, as cross-protection was also observed. This is significant as it suggests that current vaccines could provide a low-level protection against other coronaviruses and could serve as part of vaccination strategy against future novel coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 since 2019 caused substantial global morbidity and mortality and continues to burden healthcare systems worldwide. Public health measures implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread also reduced circulation of other seasonal respiratory viruses, likely causing gaps in population-level immunity. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may dampen immune responses against other pathogens is highly debated and not well understood.Figure 1. VirScan analyses of serum samples pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A) VirScan total epitope hits and geometric mean (gMean) of epitope binding (EB) scores for SARS-CoV-2 pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (B) gMean of EB scores for select pathogens pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Timepoints included in the VirScan analyses were between 15-174 days prior to and 31-155 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gray lines denote paired samples for individual subjects. Statistically significant adjusted p values of < 0.05 were determined using paired t test with Holm correction. Methods In 2022, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunocompetent adults ( > 18 years) with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination history and increased risk of social or occupational exposure to respiratory viruses. Subjects were followed for 6 months and weekly symptom surveys, blood samples at enrollment, 3 and 6 months post-enrollment, and nasal swabs at report of symptoms were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR (OpenArray) for 27 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Serum antibodies were assessed by VirScan PhIP-seq for specificity to a broad library of antigen epitopes for clinically relevant pathogens, measuring total epitope hits and epitope binding (EB) scores, a measure similar to antibody titer. Results Of 43 subjects with paired serum samples > 1 week prior to and > 28 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 subjects with viral load < Ct 22.2 were assessed by VirScan. SARS-CoV-2 epitope hits and EB scores were significantly increased post-infection compared to pre-infection (Fig 1A). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with reduced EB scores for adenovirus D and S. aureus (Fig 1B). However, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with a statistically significant decline of epitope hits or EB scores for most other clinically relevant pathogens. Conclusion We assessed broad changes in the antibody repertoires of subjects prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinically relevant pathogens at the epitope level by VirScan. Together these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with differential patterns of antibody repertoire kinetics for most non-coronavirus respiratory pathogens in immunocompetent adults. Further analyses in larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Disclosures Michael J.

        <tr id="Introduction The innate immune response is an important first checkpoint in the evolution of an infection. Although adaptive immunity is generally considered the immune component that retains antigenic memory, innate immune responses can also be affected by previous stimulations. This study evaluated the impact of vaccination on innate cell activation by TLR7/8 agonist R848, as well as seasonal variations. Methods To this end, blood samples from a cohort of 304 food and retail workers from the Quebec City region were collected during three visits at 12-week intervals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated during the first and third visits and were stimulated with R848 to assess the innate immune response. Results Our results show that IL-8 production after stimulation decreased after vaccination. In addition, the IL-8 response was significantly different depending on the season when the visit occurred, for both COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Discussion This study highlights that innate immune responses can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and fluctuate seasonally.">

        <tr id="Context: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China. From the outset, this highly contagious and dangerous illness posed significant risks and challenges for global healthcare systems and populations. Scientists and healthcare professionals worldwide have been striving to develop effective treatments for severe acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection, employing both pre-existing and innovative approaches. However, a specific drug targeted explicitly against COVID-19 remains elusive. Despite the reduced prevalence of severe cases and the predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, COVID-19 continues to pose significant risks, particularly for polymorbid patient groups. This review focuses on the potential antiviral effects of promising new drugs, including ensitrelvir, clazakizumab, upamostat, and others. Evidence Acquisition: An analytical review was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for publications related to promising drugs against SARS-CoV-2, their mechanisms of action, and potential therapeutic effects up to November 2024. Selection criteria included: (1) Free-text availability; (2) English language; (3) relevance to the publication's theme a total of 104 articles were initially selected. Of these, 27 articles were excluded for not meeting the free-text criterion, 14 were excluded due to language incompatibility, and 28 were excluded for thematic irrelevance. Ultimately, data from 35 articles were analyzed and summarized for this review. Results: Thirty-five scientific studies were reviewed to describe current paradigms and emerging concepts in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Current drugs with proven efficacy include: (1) Combined monoclonal antibodies targeting the S-protein (casirivimab/imdevimab); (2) monoclonal antibody preparations against the S-protein (pemivibart; vilobelimab); (3) viral replication inhibitors (molnupiravir); (4) protease inhibitors (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir); (5) immunosuppressants (dexamethasone; tocilizumab). The review also highlights drugs under development targeting traditional pathways [e.g., viral protease, interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and those aimed at novel mechanisms (e.g., antigalectin-3; adhesion blockers). Conclusions: Although numerous drug effects and potential drug combinations for COVID-19 have been described, limited clinical trials and research focus on identifying novel treatment approaches. Comprehensive investigations are needed to assess and evaluate the risks of different treatment strategies, minimizing potential short- and long-term complications for patients. Such advancements will pave the way for more optimal and effective medical treatment of COVID-19.">

 Introduction:
 SARS-CoV-2 causes various neurological sequelae in COVID-19 survivors including fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19 illness, is also a major risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Clinical evidence suggests that reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a likely pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and eNOS levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD . We hypothesize that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficiency contributes to brain endothelial dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and that SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerates the onset of VaD in eNOS-deficient mice.


 Methods:
 6-month-old eNOS+/- (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and WT male mice were infected with 1X10
 4
 -pfu mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2 intranasally, and animals were evaluated acutely out to 3-days-postinfection (3dpi) for changes in body weight and clinical signs of illness. Viral copy numbers and nuclear capsid were also quantified in lung and brain. Quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence were used to analyze markers of brain inflammation and senescence.


 Results:
 eNOS+/- infected mice exhibited more disease-associated weight loss (~15%) than WT-infected mice (~5 %). While infected WT and eNOS+/- had comparable pulmonary viral load, neither had detectable virus in the brain. Quantitative PCR analysis of whole brain-isolated mRNA showed increases in multiple proinflammatory mediators such as CCL2 and IL-6 and senescence markers such as p53 and p21 (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT). Similarly, immunofluorescent analysis showed increased Iba1 (microglia marker) fluorescent intensity in the cortex of infected mice (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT).


 Conclusions:
 eNOS+/- deficiency, a clinically relevant model of VaD, worsens acute SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity, neuroinflammation and markers of brain senescence despite comparable pulmonary viral load (to WT-infected animals) and absence of virus in the brain. While the potential effects of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive decline in this model will be assessed in future studies, this is the first experimental evidence demonstrating a link between eNOS and neuropathology associated with COVID-19.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to severe COVID-19, particularly in elderly individuals and those with compromised immunity. Cellular senescence has been implicated as a key pathogenic mechanism. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of regorafenib, a previously characterized senomorphic drug, for severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected K18-hACE2 mice, overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor, exhibited 100% mortality by 10 days post infection. Regorafenib treatment significantly improved survival rates, approximately 43% remaining alive. Mechanistically, regorafenib effectively suppressed type I and II interferon and cytokine signaling. Notably, regorafenib inhibited NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, a key driver of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of regorafenib and suggest its potential use as a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Systemic inflammation is associated with COVID-19 mortality rates, but the impact of inflammation on neutralizing antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on outcomes is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the association between neutralizing antibody responses, inflammation, and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Two hundred and eight patients presenting to the ED with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were included. Neutralization was assessed using the architect angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) binding inhibition assay, and inflammation was assessed using C reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Medical records were examined for 30-day mortality and 10-day intubation. Correlation between biomarkers was assessed and Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for outcomes. Thirty-seven (18%) patients died and 59 (28%) required intubation. There was a correlation between IL-6 and CRP (r = 0.34) but not ACE-2 (r < 0.06). Patients that died had higher CRP (14 mg/dl, 8-21) than those that survived (5 mg/dl, 2-11) and IL-6 (died = 344 pg/ml, 138-870 vs. survived = 65 pg/ml, 28-140). ACE-2 inhibition trended higher in those who survived (18%, 0%-65%) than those who died (3%, 0%-48%). Patients with elevated IL-6, elevated CRP, or low ACE2 inhibition had higher mortality. Only IL-6 (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.52) and age (1.04, 1.01-1.08) were associated with mortality in multivariate models. Elevated IL-6 was associated with 30-day mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lower ACE-2 inhibition was not independently associated with mortality or correlated with inflammatory markers, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.IMPORTANCEWhile systemic inflammation associated with worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not associated with neutralizing antibody concentrations, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, a major goal in biomedical research has been to understand why individuals differ in disease susceptibility, disease dynamics, and progression. In many pathologies, this variability stems from evolved immune mechanisms that resist inflammatory stress from various diseases that have been encountered throughout life. These may provide advantages against other diseases, reduce comorbidities, and enhance longevity. This study evaluates prior immunity as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, crucial for understanding plasmatic signaling cascades in different disease stages and their impact on disease progression. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system and presents a wide range of symptoms, posing significant challenges to medicine. This study systematically analyzed prior immunity and inflammation in two independent cohorts of infected patients. A serological profile is determined by protein microarrays, which identify IgM and IgG responses against 37 prevalent microbial pathogens and provide a comprehensive plasma analysis of 21 acute-phase proteins. Our results reveal distinct serological profiles correlating with disease severity, indicating that immune system dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is linked to existing immunity. These findings highlight the relevance of prior immunity for monitoring disease progression, particularly in infections and vaccine failure, and underscore the importance of functional proteomics in determining prognostic biomarkers.">

        <tr id="Complement hyperactivation and thrombotic microangiopathy are closely associated with severe COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction is a key mechanism underlying thrombotic microangiopathy. To address the relationship between endothelial injury, complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy of severe COVID-19, we wonder whether, and if so, what and how SARS-CoV-2 factors make endothelial cells (ECs) sensitive to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. We revealed that multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins enhanced complement-mediated cytotoxicity to ECs via inhibiting membrane complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) and enhancing the deposition of complement recognizing component FCN1. By screening with CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA libraries, we identified that ADAMTS9, SYAP1 and HIGD1A as intrinsic regulators of CD59 on ECs that were inhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 M, NSP16 and ORF9b proteins. IFN-γ, GM-CSF and IFN-α upregulated CD55 and CD59, which IFN-γ antagonized the inhibition of CD55 and CD59 by the three SARS-CoV-2 proteins. So, the deficiency of IFN-γ weakened the protection of CRPs against complement-mediated injury which may be enhanced during infection. Our findings illustrated the regulation of protection against complement-mediated attack on self-cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune responses, providing insights for endothelial injury, thrombotic microangiopathy and potential targets for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

        <tr id="The cuprizone (CPZ) model is widely used for modeling demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) and for testing potential remyelination therapies. We integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics (ST) to fine map the spatial cellular and molecular responses during de and remyelination. ST revealed global demyelination and neuroinflammation in the brain beyond the corpus callosum, with region-specific differences. We identified oligodendroglia and microglia as two major cell types with significant transcriptomic changes in the model. Ligand receptor pairing analyses predicted growth factor and phagocytic pathway enrichment during demyelination, which is consistent with changes in MS lesions. During remyelination, while mature oligodendrocytes nearly reversed their phenotype back to the control state, microglia remained associated with the demyelination phenotype. Finally, astrocytes in the CPZ model had the greatest preservation of disease-associated modules to MS lesions, while the MOL, OPC, and microglia showed moderate to low preservation, which overall suggested that the CPZ model had moderate translatability to chronically active MS lesions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Microglial phagocytosis of haematomas is crucial for neural functional recovery following intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), a process regulated by various factors from within and outside the central nervous system (CNS). Extracellular vesicles (EVs), significant mediators of intercellular communication, have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of CNS diseases. However, the regulatory role of endogenous EVs on the phagocytic capacity of microglia post‐ICH remains elusive. Utilising multi‐omics analysis of brain tissue‐derived EVs proteomics and single‐cell RNA sequencing, this study identified that bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDMs) potentially enhance microglial phagocytosis via EVs following ICH. By blocking BMDMs and reducing ARG1 in BMDM‐derived EVs, we demonstrated that BMDMs facilitate erythrophagocytosis by delivering ARG1 to microglia via EVs post‐ICH. EVs‐carried ARG1 was found to augment phagocytosis by promoting RAC1‐dependent cytoskeletal remodelling in microglia. Collectively, this research uncovers an intercellular communication pathway from BMDMs to microglia mediated by EVs post‐ICH. This provides a novel paradigm for EV‐mediated intercellular communication mechanisms and suggests a promising therapeutic potential for BMDM‐derived EVs in the treatment of ICH.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Problem Although it is still uncertain whether Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) placental infection and vertical transmission occur, inflammation during early pregnancy can have devastating consequences for gestation itself and the growing fetus. If and how SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific immune cells negatively affect placenta functionality is still unknown. Method of study We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from women of reproductive age with SARS‐CoV‐2 peptides and cocultured them with trophoblast spheroids (HTR‐8/SVneo and JEG‐3) to dissect if SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated immune cells can interfere with trophoblast functionality. The activation and cytokine profile of the PBMCs were determined using multicolor flow cytometry. The functionality of trophoblast spheroids was assessed using microscopy, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RT‐qPCR. Results SARS‐CoV‐2 S and M peptides significantly activated PBMCs (monocytes, NK cells, and T cells with memory subsets) and induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ. The activated PBMCs did not impact the viability, growth rate, and invasion capabilities of trophoblast spheroids. Furthermore, the hormonal production of hCG by JEG‐3 spheroids was not compromised upon coculture with the activated PBMCs. mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in trophoblast spheroid functional pathways were also not dysregulated after coculture. Conclusions Together, the findings of our in vitro coculture model, although not fully representative of in vivo conditions, strongly support the claim that the interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2‐activated peripheral blood immune cells with trophoblast cells at the fetal–maternal interface does not negatively affect trophoblast functionality.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and nearly 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system.Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model. (A) Experimental diagram: Eight weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitored daily for symptoms, or euthanized at 5 days post-infection (DPI) to collect tissue. (B) Daily weight measurements in K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020.

(D) Representative mouse brain hemisphere image showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by immunohistochemical staining. Boxed regions are shown on the right. Bar: 500 µm. Methods Here using the K18-hACE2 model, we investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on major parts of neurovascular systems, and found increased incidence of microhemorrhage and significant disruption of both BBB and BCSFB in K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cerebral microvascular injury was accompanied by substantial pericyte damage, tight junction loss, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. In addition, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation occurred at both BBB and BCSFB, as shown by upregulation of VCAM-1 and COX2 markers.Figure 2: Vascular damage and BBB breakdown in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 model. (A) Representative images showing IgG immunohistochemical staining in K18-hACE2 mouse brain tissues with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Boxed regions are shown at the bottom. (B) Representative images showing immunofluorescent staining with IgG, showing the microhemorrhage site in the cortex of K18-hACE2 mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bar: 50 µm.

(G) Quantification of the percentage of leakage vascular area to the total area of blood vessels in cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. n= 3. Results By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment.

Conclusion The impact of such changes, together with astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, may drive or at least contribute to the neurological complications seen in COVID-19 patients. As SARS-CoV-2 will likely remain a major health issue for years to come, our findings provide a needed understanding of its impact on the major CNS barriers and brain homeostasis at both molecular and cellular levels.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 3–6% of people suffer from post-COVID condition or syndrome (PCS). A subset meets the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA can persist after acute infection in serum or tissues, but their role in PCS is unclear. Methods: Here, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analyzed in the serum of 121 PCS patients with predominant fatigue and exertional intolerance, of whom 72 met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, 37 post-COVID recovered healthy controls, and 32 pre-pandemic healthy controls. Results: Spike protein was detected in the serum of 11% of recovered controls, 2% of PCS patients, and 14% of ME/CFS patients between 4 and 31 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not in pre-pandemic samples. The occurrence and concentration of spike protein did not correlate with infection or vaccination timepoints. In ME/CFS patients, spike protein presence was not associated with the severity of symptoms or functional disability. In 5 out of 22 patients who under-went immunoglobulin depletion, spike protein levels were reduced or undetectable after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. Conclusions: In summary, this study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients but found no association with ME/CFS.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV (PLWH) are known to exhibit more severe or prolonged symptoms of mpox (formerly monkeypox). However, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on PLWH with mpox has not been adequately described. We report a case of mpox in an AIDS patient who had recurrent symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented with a low CD4+ lymphocyte count (CD4 count) without antiretroviral therapy (ART) and suffered from severe mpox. The ART was initiated 17 days after the diagnosis of mpox, and the patient's skin lesions began crusting after 1 week of ART. However, after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mpox flared up again. The patient presented with more severe symptoms than those during the initial bout and with rectal involvement. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause a recrudescence of mpox in AIDS patients, which requires further investigation.">

        <tr id="This review article discusses the role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection, both conditions being renowned for their impact on the vascular endothelium. The processes involved in vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis are reviewed briefly before exploring the interplay between hypoxia, VEGF-A, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and inflammatory pathways. We then focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and show how the binding of the viral pathogen to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, as well as to NRP-1, leads to elevated levels of VEGF-A and consequences such as coagulation, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation. HIV infection augments angiogenesis via several mechanisms, most prominently, by the trans-activator of transcription (tat) protein mimicking VEGF-A by binding to its receptor, VEGFR-2, as well as upregulation of NRP-1, which enhances the interaction between VEGF-A and VEGFR-2. We propose that the elevated levels of VEGF-A observed during HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection originate predominantly from activated immune cells due to the upregulation of HIF-1α by damaged endothelial cells. In this context, a few clinical trials have described a diminished requirement for oxygen therapy during anti-VEGF treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The currently available anti-VEGF therapy strategies target the binding of VEGF-A to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The blocking of both receptors could, however, lead to a negative outcome, inhibiting not only pathological, but also physiological angiogenesis. Based on the examination of published studies, this review suggests that treatment targeting selective inhibition of VEGFR-1 may be beneficial in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) promotes innate immune evasion by inhibiting host translation in human cells. However, the role of nsp1 in other host species remains elusive, especially in bats which are natural reservoirs of sarbecoviruses and possess a markedly different innate immune system than humans. Here, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 potently inhibits translation in bat cells from Rhinolophus lepidus, belonging to the same genus as known sarbecovirus reservoirs hosts. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 bound to the Rhinolophus lepidus 40S ribosome and show that it blocks the mRNA entry channel via targeting a highly conserved site among mammals. Accordingly, we found that nsp1 blocked protein translation in mammalian cell lines from several species, underscoring its broadly inhibitory activity and conserved role in numerous SARS-CoV-2 hosts. Our findings illuminate the arms race between coronaviruses and mammalian host immunity (including bats), providing a foundation for understanding the determinants of viral maintenance in bat hosts and spillovers.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: The impact of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the immunity of patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) is still not fully known. Further clarification could help address medical concerns related to the use of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory medications, known as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), in PwMS, as well as ensure adequate protection against severe outcomes of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response in PwMS treated with DMTs. Methods: The concentrations of IgG Spike (S) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and IgG Nucleocapsid (N) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) titers were analyzed in PwMS groups treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF), interferon beta (IFN), and healthy control group. Results: Almost 100% of PwMS experienced seroconversion, which resulted from either vaccination and/or prior infection. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the study and control groups in terms of IgG (S) and (N) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. However, interferon-gamma titers were lower in both PwMS groups, which may indicate adequate humoral and decreased cellular response to the examined PwMS. Additionally, after the division of the whole study group into two subgroups according to the time since the last vaccination, IgG (S) anti-SARS-CoV-2 and IFN-γ concentrations were significantly lower in the case of patients who were immunized more than 200 days before sample collection. No differences were observed in the case of subgroups in which sample collection was less than 200 days after vaccination when compared to the control group. Conclusions: This could indicate a time-related decrease in immunity in PwMS treated with DMTs.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a profound global impact since its emergence in late 2019. Characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress and death, COVID-19 has necessitated extensive research into the host-pathogen interactions that drive disease progression. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic interventions and preventative strategies. This study employed a multi-omic approach that combined direct RNA sequencing (DRS) and Illumina cDNA sequencing to investigate whole blood transcriptomic profiles in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging the unique capabilities of Nanopore DRS, which provides long-read sequencing data, we were able to capture not only gene expression levels but also crucial RNA modifications, including poly(A) tail length, non-adenine residue (non-A), pseudouridylation (psU), and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) methylation. This comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the impact of these RNA modifications on gene expression and function within the context of COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant alterations in gene expression patterns, poly(A) tail lengths, non-A and the prevalence of psU and m5C modifications in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. These results provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between viral infection, host immune response, and RNA processing, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Alcohol-induced dysregulation of microglial activity is associated with neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, heightened risk for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol dependence, and escalation of alcohol drinking. Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia.">

        <tr id="Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by bacteria or viruses are associated with stroke severity. Recent studies have revealed an imbalance in the von Willebrand factor (VWF)-ADAMTS13 axis in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. We examined whether this imbalance contributes to RTI-mediated stroke severity. Wild-type (WT), Vwf -/-, or Adamts13-/- mice with respective littermate controls (Vwf +/+, or Adamts13+/+) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of S. aureus (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0) and subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion. In S. aureus-infected mice, infarct volumes were assessed on day 2 and functional outcomes on weeks 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. In SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, infarct volumes and functional outcomes (Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion. We demonstrated that S. aureus or SARS-CoV-2 RTI was accompanied by an imbalance in the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis and an increase in plasma levels of IL-6, CXCL1, and MCP-1, which was associated with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infection). S. aureus- or SARS-CoV-2-infected Vwf -/- mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes, while infected Adamts13-/- mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. control). In the models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF contributes to stroke severity, while ADAMTS13 is protective.">

        <tr id="Introduction The high percentage of Omicron breakthrough infection in vaccinees is an emerging problem, of which we have a limited understanding of the phenomenon. Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="In a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals treated with the antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the virus rebounds following treatment. The mechanisms driving this rebound are not well understood. We used a mathematical model to describe the longitudinal viral load dynamics of 51 individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 20 of whom rebounded. Target cell preservation, either by a robust innate immune response or initiation of N-R near the time of symptom onset, coupled with incomplete viral clearance, appears to be the main factor leading to viral rebound. Moreover, the occurrence of viral rebound is likely influenced by the time of treatment initiation relative to the progression of the infection, with earlier treatments leading to a higher chance of rebound. A comparison with an untreated cohort suggests that early treatments with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be associated with a delay in the onset of an adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that extending the course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment to a 10-day regimen may greatly diminish the chance of rebound in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Altogether, our results suggest that in some individuals, a standard 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir starting around the time of symptom onset may not completely eliminate the virus. Thus, after treatment ends, the virus can rebound if an effective adaptive immune response has not fully developed. These findings on the role of target cell preservation and incomplete viral clearance also offer a possible explanation for viral rebounds following other antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2.


IMPORTANCE
Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In a subset of individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the initial reduction in viral load is followed by viral rebound once treatment is stopped. We show that the timing of treatment initiation with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may influence the risk of viral rebound. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir stops viral growth and preserves target cells but may not lead to full clearance of the virus. Thus, once treatment ends, if an effective adaptive immune response has not adequately developed, the remaining virus can lead to rebound. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of rebound and can help develop better treatment strategies to minimize this possibility.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 provokes acute oxidative stress in the lungs via cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic factors, which might cause alveolar injury followed by severe respiratory syndrome during COVID-19 infection. The lack of particular antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 has opened novel avenues of complementary and alternative medicine as a potential remedy. The current study explored the mechanistic role of the ultradiluted formulation of Eupatorium (UDE) against SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S protein-mediated oxidative stress and mitochondriopathy. Methods: Cell line and BALB/c mice were used to report that SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused an inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm via the NF-κB pathway in the lung along with oxidative damage. Morphological examination was performed using DAPI staining and histology for treated cells and lung tissues of animals, respectively. The molecular mechanism of action of UDE was investigated through qRT-PCR for the genetic expressions of various cytokines, inflammatory, and apoptotic mediators; ELISA, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for the translational expression of the same molecules assayed for genetic expressions; and biochemical assays for various enzymes and ROS. Results: UDE treatment suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue-level oxidative stress and safeguarded mitochondrial integrity from free radical-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, UDE played a direct role in restoring cellular redox homeostasis and reducing the inflammatory response by suppressing NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1 expression, and ROS formation. Further, a plausible mechanism of action of UDE against S protein-induced damage was proposed. Conclusions: This study described a novel therapeutic approach against S protein-mediated hyperinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative damage. Hence, UDE may be considered as a prospective alternative to combat life-threatening consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of thirteen human retina samples (from living and post-mortem donors) across non-diabetic, diabetic, and DR states to create a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas. We uncover three distinct microglial states—homeostatic, stress-response, and inflammatory—along a functional continuum, rather than discrete activation states, with dynamic transitions occurring throughout disease progression. Trajectory analysis indicates bifurcating paths starting from the homeostatic state branching toward stress-response and inflammatory states. Three major functional modules: ribosomal/translation, coordinated immune cell function, and inflammatory/transcriptional regulation, showing disease-specific activation patterns were identified. Cell communication analysis further highlights sophisticated neural-immune interactions, particularly between photoreceptors and microglia. Our findings provide insights into the complex cellular dynamics of DR progression and suggest potential therapeutic targets for early intervention.">

        <tr id="Background/Aim Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, manifests a wide range of clinical symptoms ranging from mild to moderate and severe. Host-related factors influence the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection; for instance, the expression of host microRNAs (miRNAs) could influence the progression and complications of COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the expression pattern of endogenous miRNAs in 80 severe COVID-19 patients compared to a group of healthy individuals. Materials and Methods The miRNA screening expression analysis was performed using TaqMan Low-Density Array, and the expression changes of miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p were validated using RT-qPCR. In silico analysis was used to identify new targets and predict the pathways, biological processes, and interactions of the selected miRNAs. Results The miR-490-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-454-3p, and miR-431-5p, were over-expressed in the total population of severe COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. miR-490-3p was found to be over-expressed in both female and male COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Specific miRNAs might be a potential biomarker for predicting the clinical course of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Exacerbated inflammation is a major contributor to tissue damage and mortality in infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. The resolution phase of inflammation is critical for restoring tissue homeostasis following an injury. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a ubiquitous protein that plays a fundamental role in the resolution of inflammation, including in preclinical models of infectious disease. Here, we investigated the role of AnxA1 in coronavirus infection and its potential as a host-targeted therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Wild-type (WT) and AnxA1 knockout (AnxA1KO) mice were intranasally infected with the murine betacoronavirus MHV-3 to study the endogenous role of AnxA1. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses in the lungs of MHV-3-infected mice revealed increased AnxA1 expression and its cleavage, which was associated with neutrophilic infiltration (Ly6G+ cells) mainly in peribronchiolar and perivascular regions. AnxA1-deficient mice exhibited higher neutrophilic infiltration and lung damage, alongside increased CXCL1 production in the lungs, when compared to WT-infected mice. In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice, we found increased AnxA1 cleavage associated with lung inflammation. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice with the AnxA1-mimetic peptide, Ac2-26, reduced lung damage and lethality, without altering the host ability to deal with viral replication. Notably, Ac2-26-treated mice exhibited similar levels of protection to that afforded by the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight the protective role of the endogenous AnxA1 in mitigating coronavirus-induced lung inflammation and underscore the therapeutic potential of AnxA1 mimetic Ac2-26 as a host-targeted therapy against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory tract and lungs; however, the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can also involve the central nervous system. The pathomechanisms underlying neurological impairments in COVID-19 and post COVID-19 condition remain incompletely understood, hence experimental studies under defined conditions, in a suitable animal model, can help to clarify the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. The K18-hACE2 mouse represents such a model, as intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 VOC generally results in widespread neuronal infection with limited tissue response in the brain, consistent with a mild non-suppurative (meningo)encephalitis, with microgliosis, astrogliosis and (peri)vascular leukocyte infiltrates but no evidence of infection of vessel structures. The present study used this model to address the hypothesis that the vascular reaction is secondary to the neuronal infection. It confirmed that in intranasally challenged K18-hACE2 mice the virus targeted the neurons without overt neuropathic effect, whilst sparing the blood vessels, and further characterised the resulting inflammatory response in the brain in situ and through bulk RNA sequencing. The former highlighted the recruitment of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) via postcapillary venules, with their accumulation in the perivascular space and occasional emigration into the neuroparenchyma, without targeting and/or damage to the vessel wall. At the transcriptome level, this was accompanied by positive enrichment of pathways and the upregulation of genes involved in both the inflammatory reaction and the recruitment (including adhesion and migration) and activity of the leukocytes. We also found morphological and molecular evidence of subtle impairment of blood-brain barrier function, i.e. increased permeability. The results obtained from the model indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the neurons induces neuroinflammation, with leukocyte recruitment and activation as well as blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These data can help to understand more fully the reaction of the CNS in COVID-19 patients, and neurotropic virus infections in general.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still poorly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) in modulating the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that overexpression of TLR10 in A549 lung epithelial cells, immunostimulated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins S and N mainly downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and interferons and affected gene expression in the cocultured THP-1 monocytes. Our results suggest that TLR10 could mediate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection by downregulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL10, IL6, IL8, and IFNβ. Modulation of TLR10 expression could have implications for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, in whom excessive inflammation leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a key feature. However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of modulating TLR10 expression on the antiviral response and the overall balance of the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 remain a major global health challenge. We have discovered a second-generation small molecule 3CL protease inhibitor S-892216 that is proceeding with phase 1 study in Japan. S-892216 has potent antiviral activity and addresses current treatment concerns of currently available antivirals regarding drug-drug interaction (DDI) and safety. We evaluated the therapeutic effect of S-892216 by using SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster model. In this study, virus titer in lungs and nasal turbinates (NT), lung inflammation, body weight loss and lung weight increase caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. Methods Syrian hamsters were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BE.1/BA.5-like. The hamsters were orally treated twice daily with S-892216 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg or ensitrelvir 50 mg/kg, or subcutaneously treated with nirmatrelvir 750/250 mg/kg (750 mg/kg for the loading dose and 250 mg/kg for the maintenance doses) from 1 day post infection for 5 days. Lungs and NT were collected for virus titers and lung inflammation evaluation. Lung weights were measured 7 days post infection and body weight changes were monitored until 14 days post infection. Results Oral treatment with S-892216 significantly reduced virus titers in lung (1.9- and 2.9-log reduction at the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and NT (1.8- and 2.3-log reduction at the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) 3 days post infection. In addition, S-892216 suppressed lung inflammation and body weight loss caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection dose dependently. The virus titer reduction in lung and NT and suppression of lung inflammation and body weight losses were comparable in S-892216 1 mg/kg, ensitrelvir 50 mg/kg and nirmatrelvir 750/250 mg/kg treatment groups. Conclusion Oral treatment with S-892216 exhibited therapeutic effect in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. Furthermore, S-892216 showed comparable efficacy at lower dosages compared to ensitrelvir and nirmatrelvir. These findings suggest that S-892216 could be used at lower dosage than the current treatment options in clinical settings. We will evaluate DDI and the safety potential of S-892216 in clinical trials in future.

        <tr id="Single-cell transcriptomics applied to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for elucidating the pathophysiology of neurologic diseases has produced only a preliminary characterization of CSF immune cells. CSF derives from and borders central nervous system (CNS) tissue, allowing for comprehensive accounting of cell types along with their relative abundance and immunologic profiles relevant to CNS diseases. Using integration techniques applied to publicly available datasets in combination with our own studies, we generated a compendium with 139 subjects encompassing 135 CSF and 58 blood samples. Healthy subjects and individuals across a wide range of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, COVID-19, and autoimmune encephalitis, were included. We found differences in lymphocyte and myeloid subset frequencies across different diseases as well as in their distribution between blood and CSF. We identified what we believe to be a new subset of AREG+ dendritic cells exclusive to the CSF that was more abundant in subjects with MS compared with healthy controls. Finally, transcriptional cell states in CSF microglia-like cells and lymphoid subsets were elucidated. Altogether, we have created a reference compendium for single-cell transcriptional profiling encompassing CSF immune cells useful to the scientific community for future studies on neurologic diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Persistent symptoms after COVID-19 constitute the long COVID syndrome, also called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). COVID-19 vaccines reduce the gravity of ensuing SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, whether vaccines also have an impact on PASC remain unknown. We investigated whether vaccination prior to infection alters the subsequent neurologic post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC). We studied prospectively the first consecutive 200 post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) and 1100 non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP) patients evaluated at our neuro-COVID-19 clinic between May 2020 and January 2023. Among PNP patients, 87% had a pre-vaccination infection and 13% had a breakthrough infection post-vaccination. Among the NNP patients, 70.7% had a pre-vaccination infection and 29.3% had a breakthrough infection. Both PNP and NNP breakthrough infection patients had more frequent pre-existing depression/anxiety than their respective pre-vaccination infection groups, and NNP breakthrough infection patients also had more frequent comorbidities of headache, lung and gastrointestinal diseases than the NNP pre-vaccination infection group. An average of 10 months after symptom onset, the three most common neurological symptoms for PNP patients were brain fog (86.5%), numbness/tingling (56.5%) and headache (56.5%). Of all Neuro-PASC symptoms, PNP breakthrough infection more frequently reported anosmia compared to PNP pre-vaccination infection patients (69.2 versus 37.9%; P = 0.005). For NNP patients, the three most common neurological symptoms were brain fog (83.9%), headache (70.9%) and dizziness (53.8%). NNP pre-vaccination infection reported anosmia (56.6 versus 39.1%; P < 0.0001) and dysgeusia (53.3 versus 37.3%; P < 0.0001) more frequently than breakthrough infection patients. NNP breakthrough infection more frequently reported dizziness compared to NNP pre-vaccination infection patients (61.5 versus 50.6%; P = 0.001). Both PNP and NNP patients had impaired quality-of-life in cognitive, fatigue, sleep, anxiety and depression domains with no differences between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups. PNP patients performed worse on National Institutes of Health Toolbox tests of processing speed, attention, executive function and working memory than a US normative population whereas NNP patients had lower results in processing, speed, attention and working memory, without differences between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups. These results indicate that vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection does not affect the neurologic manifestations of long COVID in either PNP or NNP patients. Minor differences in neurologic symptoms between pre-vaccination infection and breakthrough infection groups may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 strains evolution. Patients developing Neuro-PASC after breakthrough infection have a higher burden of comorbidities, highlighting different risk factors warranting targeted management.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute COVID-19 infection causes significant alterations in the innate and adaptive immune systems. While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Methods We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC. Results COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors. Discussion The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation. While LC patients displayed recovery in innate immune profiles comparable to healthy and Recovered individuals, deficits in T cell and memory B cell populations were evident, differentiating LC from full recovery. These findings provide insights into LC pathogenesis and may support the development of diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Many common symptoms in post-acute sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). We examined symptoms and performance of the PASC score, developed in the general population, in MS based on infection history.


METHODS
We surveyed North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) registry participants regarding infections and categorized participants based on infection history. Symptoms experienced before, during, and after infection were used to identify persistent new symptoms. PASC was defined as a score ⩾ 12 based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study RECOVER.


RESULTS
Of 4787 participants surveyed, 2927 were included: 294 (10%) having recent COVID-19; 853 (29.1%) recent non-COVID-19 infection; 246 (8.4%) recent COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection; 1534 (52.4%) uninfected, defined as never having COVID-19 nor any infection within the past 6 months. Compared to those uninfected, infection groups reported at least a two-fold increase in fever, cough, loss of smell/taste, and shortness of breath. Based on persistent new symptoms, PASC was identified in only 1.5% of participants with COVID-19.


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests lower than expected prevalence of PASC in MS and a complex association between infections and development of new persistent symptoms following infections. The similar proportions classified with PASC across infection groups shows that symptoms of PASC are common and complicate assessment of PASC in MS.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is central to temporal lobe epilepsy, yet the specific role of myeloid cells remains unclear. In status epilepticus (SE) models, circulating monocytes have been reported to infiltrate the brain, though distinguishing them from microglia remains challenging. Using a rat model, we traced infiltrating monocytes post-SE, to investigate their persistence, phenotypic evolution during epileptogenesis and contribution to neuroinflammation. By tracking phagocyted fluorescent nanoparticles and using CD68 immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that monocytes entered the brain in significant numbers 24 hours post-SE, after the inflammatory peak occurred (7h post-SE). Tracked up to 7 weeks, these cells adopted a microglia-like phenotype, contributed to the microglial scar and sustained low-grade inflammation during the chronic phase of epilepsy solely through their presence, as their expression of pro-inflammatory markers resembled that of non-activated microglia. Importantly, monocytes initially and transiently supported an anti-inflammatory response providing a unique opportunity to modulate neuroinflammation and potentially disrupt epilepsy progression, opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alarmed the global community due to the significant loss of human lives during the pandemic. However, as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining. A positive aspect of this recent pandemic has been that it stimulated scientists to create vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, accelerating the emergence of new therapeutic agents based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Numerous mRNA therapeutic products are currently in development, with dozens at various clinical trial stages. These products have facilitated significant changes in the paradigm of medical therapy, including the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although most of these cardiovascular mRNA therapeutics are still in preclinical development, phase IIa trials for myocardial ischemia therapy have already been completed with encouraging results. The scope of mRNA therapy for CVD is extremely broad, potentially even limitless, with ongoing research including conditions like myocardial ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias, hypercholesterolemia, and occlusive arterial diseases. Moreover, mRNA can be used to enhance the effectiveness of cell therapies. In the future, researchers predict that mRNA therapies will not only replace some existing biopharmaceuticals and pharmacotherapy methods but also be applied to treat previously considered untreatable cardiovascular diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Factors leading to severe COVID-19 remain partially known. New biomarkers predicting COVID-19 severity that are also causally involved in disease pathogenesis could improve patient management and contribute to the development of innovative therapies. Autophagy, a cytosolic structure degradation pathway is involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, degradation of intracellular pathogens and generation of energy for immune responses. Acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) is a key regulator of autophagy in the context of diabetes, obesity and anorexia. The objective of our work was to assess whether circulating ACBP levels are associated with COVID-19 severity, using proteomics data from the plasma of 903 COVID-19 patients. Methods Somalogic proteomic analysis was used to detect 5000 proteins in plasma samples collected between March 2020 and August 2021 from hospitalized participants in the province of Quebec, Canada. Plasma samples from 903 COVID-19 patients collected during their admission during acute phase of COVID-19 and 295 hospitalized controls were assessed leading to 1198 interpretable proteomic profiles. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were measured by ELISA and a cell-binding assay. Results The median age of the participants was 59 years, 46% were female, 65% had comorbidities. Plasma ACBP levels correlated with COVID-19 severity, in association with inflammation and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, independently of sex or the presence of comorbidities. Samples collected during the second COVID-19 wave in Quebec had higher levels of plasma ACBP than during the first wave. Plasma ACBP levels were negatively correlated with biomarkers of T and NK cell responses interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-21, independently of age, sex, and severity. Conclusions Circulating ACBP levels can be considered a biomarker of COVID-19 severity linked to inflammation. The contribution of extracellular ACBP to immunometabolic responses during viral infection should be further studied.">

The study included 81 patients diagnosed with long COVID, the presence of which was determined by the persistence of a complex of multidirectional symptoms for more than 12 weeks that developed during or after COVID-19. Flow cytometry was used to assess lymphocyte subsets. The main lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed: T cells, cytotoxic T cells, B cells, NK and NKT cells in blood plasma via multiplex xMAP analysis. Also concentrations of GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, MIP-1b, TNF were measured. The content of proinflammatory cytokines and some immune system cells was characterized in respondents with long COVID. A comparative analysis of data was conducted with individuals without a history of COVID-19, as well as between patients with different numbers of SARS-CoV-2 cases.Results and discussion. The study identified characteristic features of long COVID that affect both the nervous and immune systems.Analysis of the blood cells revealed absolute and relative lymphopenia due to a decrease in NK cells. We also noticed an increased number of NKT cells in patients who suffered multiple COVID-19, when compared to those who only were infected with SARS-CoV-2 once. Cytokine analysis revealed increase in concentrations of IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17 and CCL2/MCP1 in blood plasma of long COVID patients.Conclusion.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to people worldwide causing a variety of diseases, manifesting with intestinal, respiratory, hepatic, and neurological symptoms. The therapeutic strategy to counteract SARS-CoV-2 encompasses antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, such as systemic glucocorticoids which may benefit patients with middle and severe COVID-19. The spike glycoprotein (S protein), which recognizes the host cell receptor and initiates the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to it, can be considered a potential target for glucocorticoids. However, the mechanism of glucocorticoid inhibitory action against the S protein is currently unclear due to insufficient study of the ligand-binding sites on the S protein. The aim of the study was to evaluate the binding characteristics of systemic glucocorticoids to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and to elucidate the topological features of non-covalent ligand-protein complexes. AutoDock Vina was used for molecular docking studies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein with ligands. Dexamethasone (DEX), methylprednisolone (Medrol), triamcinolone (TAC), and prednisone (PRED) were selected as ligands. The Open Babel 3.1.1 software was used to prepare ligand structures. Two 3D structures of the S protein which have open (RBD-up) and closed (RBD-down) conformations in the receptor-binding domain (PDB ID: 6VYB, and PDB ID: 6VXX), respectively, were used as docking targets (www.rcsb.org). Ligand interactions with amino acid residues were identified using the PLIP web tool (https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de). Visualization of docking results was implemented in PyMol 2.5. Docking study demonstrated that all glucocorticoids can bind to multiple sites in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including the receptor-binding fragment (S1) and the fusion fragment (S2). Methylprednisolone showed the best affinity with the S protein in RBD-up conformation than other glucocorticoids, with a binding free energy of –9.7 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value of 0.08⋅10–6 M. Triamcinolone demonstrated a high affinity with the S protein in RBD-down conformation, at which the binding free energy was −8.8 kcal/mole and an inhibition constant value was 0.36⋅10–6 M. Our results show that Gly744, Asp745 and Arg1000 are mainly involved in the stabilization of complexes through the hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic interactions are primarily mediated by Thr572, Ile587, and Val976. These results are an important basis for the development of potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to an emerging health challenge known as long COVID, also known as PASC, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, characterized by symptoms that persist beyond the acute phase of infection. While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background COVID‐19 has been associated with both respiratory (diaphragm) and non‐respiratory (limb) muscle atrophy. It is unclear if SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of skeletal muscle plays a role in these changes. This study sought to: 1) determine if cells comprising skeletal muscle tissue, particularly myofibres, express the molecular components required for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; 2) assess the capacity for direct SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and its impact on atrophy pathway genes in myogenic cells; and 3) in an animal model of COVID‐19, examine the relationship between viral infection of skeletal muscle and myofibre atrophy within the diaphragm and limb muscles. Methods We used in silico bioinformatics analysis of published human single cell RNA‐seq datasets, as well as direct qPCR examination of human myotubes and diaphragm biopsies, to assess expression of key genes involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 cellular entry. In Vitro, we determined the ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 to directly infect myogenic cells and employed qPCR to assess the impact on muscle atrophy pathway genes (ubiquitin‐proteasome, autophagy). In vivo, the diaphragm and quadriceps of Roborovski hamsters with SARS‐CoV‐2 respiratory infection were examined at day 3 post‐inoculation to evaluate the relationship between atrophy pathway and SARS‐CoV‐2 transcripts by qPCR, as well as histological measurements of myofibre morphology. Results Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as cooperating proteases (furin, cathepsins B and L), are expressed by myofibres. ACE2 expression was increased 5‐fold (p = 0.01) in the diaphragms of mechanically ventilated human subjects compared to controls. In Vitro, a time‐dependent increase of SARS‐CoV‐2 transcript levels was observed in myotubes directly exposed to the virus (p = 0.002). This was associated with downregulation of the ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (by 64%, p = 0.002) and the autophagy gene LC3B (by 31%, p = 0.009). In contrast, in vivo infection led to upregulation of MuRF1 in quadriceps (23‐fold, p = 0.0007) and autophagy genes in both quadriceps (5.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 7‐fold for p62, p = 0.0002) and diaphragm (2.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 2.3‐fold for p62, p = 0.057). In infected hamsters the diaphragm lacked viral transcripts but exhibited atrophy (48% decrease in myofibre area; p = 0.02), whereas the quadriceps lacked myofibre atrophy despite elevated viral transcripts in the muscle. Conclusions Although myogenic cells express the genes required for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and can be directly infected, there was no evident relationship between viral transcript levels and manifestations of atrophy, either in vitro or in vivo. Our results do not support direct myofibre infection by SARS‐CoV‐2 as a likely cause of atrophy in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased severity and mortality from respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination in the general population significantly reduces the risk of severe respiratory viral infection and triggers a strong, polyfunctional and lasting T cell response in healthy individuals. However, vaccine effectiveness in people with diabetes is unclear. Here we studied the magnitude and functional characteristics of vaccine-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to the full vaccination protocol, and the recall response after a third booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and compared them to those of people without diabetes. We found defects in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory maintenance and the functionality of the vaccine specific T cells in people with diabetes compared to people without. In those individuals with diabetes that harbored detectable vaccine-specific T cells, they displayed an unfocused, tolerogenic phenotype characterized by increased expression of IL-13 and IL-10 in T1D and T2D compared to people without diabetes. These results have implications for vaccination strategies for people with diabetes.">

Recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 are primarily characterized
by endotheliitis (or endothelialitis), whose severity is related to the pre-existing or current damage to
the complex structure that lines the surface of the vascular endothelium, most notably the glycocalyx.
Such damage results in the loss of many endothelial cell functions. To restore these functions, the
cell must repair the glycocalyx that covers it. However, this is not always possible, especially when
the repair capacity of such an exo-endo-cytoplasmic cell structure is limited due to cellular senescence.
If the gene repair system remains activated, the damaged glycocalyx can be reconstituted via
specific transcriptional pathways in response to oxidative and reductive stresses. Despite the experimental
evidence in favour of this hypothesis, many of the recently published reviewrs on long
COVID do not mention the use of therapeutic treatments via specific 'oxidative eustress'. In fact,
mild and controlled oxidative stress is able to induce an activating response to cellular damage repair
processes. This perspective aims to draw the attention of researchers to these aspects in an attempt to
address this gap in understanding.

Although recommended isolation periods for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been shortened as the pandemic has subsided, prolonged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding remains common in immunocompromised patients. This study estimated the probability of viral clearance in these patients based on elapsed days and specific risk factors.


METHODS
We prospectively enrolled immunocompromised patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from January 2022 to May 2023 during the Omicron variant era. We collected weekly respiratory specimens for viral load measurement and culture. We identified significant predictors of viral culture negative conversion through univariate and multivariate analyses and estimated viral clearance probabilities using a Cox time-varying proportional hazard model.


RESULTS
Among 70 patients with serial 319 respiratory specimens with positive SARS-CoV-2 genomic polymerase chain reaction results that underwent cell culture, ∼69% (48) had haematologic malignancies and 31% (22) underwent solid organ transplants. B-cell depleting agents and viral copy number significantly influenced viral culture negative conversion. The probability of culture-negative conversion for immunocompromised patients not treated with B-cell-depleting agents increased over time, with over 90% achieving negative conversion by Day 84. Patients treated with B-cell depleting agents showed lower conversion rates. By Day 84, <90% of patients with cycle threshold values 23-28 [4.85-6.35 log copies/mL] achieved culture-negative conversion. The results indicate more prolonged shedding than in patients without B-cell depletion.


CONCLUSION
Estimating SARS-CoV-2 clearance probabilities based on specific risk factors can guide individualised isolation decisions for immunocompromised patients, tailoring policies to each patient's delayed viral clearance risk.">

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there was a marked increase in alcohol consumption. COVID-19 superimposed on underlying liver disease notably worsens the outcome of many forms of liver injury. The goal of a current pilot study was to test the dual exposure of alcohol and COVID-19 infection in an experimental animal model of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD).


METHODS
After 4 weeks of ethanol (EtOH) feeding, C57BL/6 male mice received SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2-N501YMA30) intranasally at 3 × 102, 1 × 103, 3 × 103, and 1 × 104 plaque-forming units (PFU). Mice were then weighed/monitored daily for morbidity/mortality for 10 days while continuing EtOH consumption. Markers of liver inflammation, injury, and intestinal barrier integrity were evaluated.


RESULTS
A similar gradual weight loss was observed in all inoculated mice (slightly less in the 3 × 102 group) up to post-infection day 4. Greater mortality was observed in mice receiving the highest viral dose at days 3 and 4 post-infection. The majority of the surviving mice subjected to EtOH and inoculated with 3 × 103 or 1 × 104 PFU rapidly lost 25% of their body weight and were euthanized on post-infection day 4. Analysis of liver health in animals that survived to the end of the experiment exhibited no significant changes in hepatic steatosis but had a limited increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels at all viral doses versus EtOH alone. However, the 1 × 104 PFU viral dose exacerbated EtOH-induced hepatic inflammation characterized by elevated levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including Il-6 and Tnf-α. There was limited effect of viral infection on the intestine.


CONCLUSIONS
SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a dose-dependent negative impact on body weight and survival in mice fed EtOH. This pilot study suggests that early mortality observed after high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge could be due, in part, to hepatic dysfunction following chronic EtOH feeding.">

        <tr id="Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of pathophysiological conditions linked to the disruption of metabolic processes associated with energy storage and consumption. Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are currently diagnosed with MetS. Patients with MetS experience higher mortality rates following SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibit poor vaccine efficacy following influenza virus vaccination compared to metabolically healthy individuals. However, the specific impact of MetS on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination has not been widely studied. To address this gap, we utilized high-fat diet feeding to establish a murine model of MetS, in which mice exhibit the same diagnostic criteria for MetS as human patients. We then used high-fat diet-induced MetS mice and regular chow diet-fed wild-type mice to analyze immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we monitored mice for disease severity, measured levels of virally induced inflammation, and quantified viral titers in various tissues. Our results indicate that MetS mice exhibit accelerated mortality post-infection, accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokine transcripts at sites of infection. Additionally, MetS alters the degree of viral replication across various tissues. Furthermore, our vaccination studies revealed that MetS reduces the potency of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Delta variant. Overall, our findings suggest that MetS exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and diminishes vaccine efficacy, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to protect individuals with MetS from severe outcomes following infection and vaccination. Impact This study represents the first detailed account of the failure to generate protective neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mice with metabolic syndrome (MetS) following vaccination. The insights gained from this research inform future vaccine design and aid in identifying individuals at greater risk of breakthrough infections. By specifically isolating the risk associated with MetS, rather than obesity alone, these findings lay the groundwork for future investigations aimed at enhancing immune responses in individuals with MetS. This work is highly relevant to a broad audience, as it addresses a critical unmet need in vaccine development and provides essential guidance for the rational design of vaccines to protect vulnerable populations affected by MetS.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic and devastating health crisis. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and the exaggerated immune response resulting from infection with this disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Activation may have a contribution to disease severity.A case study was carried out in order to find the association between COVID-19, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2. The effect of age, sex, smoking, diabetic and hypertention on the level of the studied cytokines were evaluated. Inaddition, the influnce of COVID-19 severity on TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2 levels were studied. Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="In biomedical infectious disease research new models to bridge preclinical and clinical research are needed. Mouse models are still one of the most-interrogated experimental systems with the caveat of biological differences in pathogen-host-interaction for some human-relevant pathogens and increasing ethical concerns. Arguably one of the most complex cell culture models are precision cut organ slices, volume defined tissue blocks which can be cultured ex vivo and exposed to various stimuli including human pathogens. They could be applied as 3R model system. However, their response to infectious agents in comparison to in vivo models is understudied. To understand species and model specific differences in the host response (here: influenza A virus (IAV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)), we interrogate here the transcriptional reaction of human PCLS (hPCLS) compared to that of murine precision cut lung slices (mPCLS) and a murine in vivo infection model. A direct comparison of hPCLS and mPCLS revealed a more complex early innate immune response against viral and bacterial pathogens in the human model, which beyond this informs about secondary cell-to-cell communication in situ and bystander cell responses to proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines secreted by tissue resident immune cells. In contrast, the murine PCLS model revealed substantial deficits in responding to viral challenge, reproducing only a small fraction of the murine in vivo host response. Our study provides the first cross-species comparison of early transcriptomic responses to relevant human pathogens.">

        <tr id="HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) cause significant dysfunction among people living with HIV. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system and are readily infected by HIV. Microglia are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to identify pathways that may contribute to neuropathogenesis in HAND, we infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iMG) with HIV and defined gene expression changes over an 8-day period. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were studied in parallel in order to identify common pathways stimulated in myeloid cells versus the unique aspects of microglia infection. Infection of iMG led to the induction of a robust early inflammatory response triggered within hours of infection, a pattern that differed significantly from that seen in MDMs. Remarkably, gene expression changes in iMG reproduced many of the characteristic genetic signatures previously identified in brain tissues obtained from individuals clinically diagnosed with HAND. Inflammatory activation representing interferon-mediated signaling, TNF/NF-κB, and IL-6/JAK/STAT pathways were particularly prominent over the time course of infection. Interferon-mediated signaling led to enhanced expression of multiple HIV restriction factors, yet viral replication in iMG remained robust. These findings suggest that HIV infection of microglia is the key cellular driver of neuroinflammation in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals. Further studies of infected microglia are likely to aid in understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and in evaluating therapeutic strategies to limit or eliminate HIV-induced neuropathogenesis. Author Summary Persons living with HIV frequently develop debilitating problems with brain function that are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Treatment with antiretroviral drugs to control HIV has largely eliminated the most severe form of HIV-related brain dysfunction, HIV encephalitis, but a significant proportion of HIV-infected individuals receiving antiviral therapy still develop significant problems with cognitive function. Microglia are the major macrophage-like cells of the brain and are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Inflammation in the brain following infection contributes to damage to neurons and is the likely source of decline of brain function. This study used microglia that were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, termed iMG, to study the kinetics of gene expression changes in HIV-infected microglia, and compared those changes to those seen in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). iMG were found to be easily infected with a macrophage-tropic HIV strain and exhibited a rapid increase in gene expression associated with inflammatory signaling through interferon- and tumor necrosis factor/NF-kappa B-mediated pathways. Remarkably, the patterns of gene expression in microglia strongly overlapped with gene expression signatures derived from brain tissue samples of HIV patients with HAND. The rapid onset and magnitude of inflammation as well as induction of specific HIV restriction factors differed from that seen in infected macrophages/MDMs. These studies reinforce the central role of microglia in the pathogenesis of HAND and provide insights into HIV-microglia interactions that can help direct interventions to reduce inflammation and preserve brain function.">

        <tr id="Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of treatment options have been evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials, with several being approved for use in humans. Immunomodulatory drugs have shown success in dampening the deleterious inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 patients, but there remains an urgent need for development of additional therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. A potential drug target is the CCR5-CCL5 axis, and blocking this pathway may protect against severe disease. Here we evaluated whether OB-002, an analog of human CCL5 and a potent antagonist of CCR5, provides therapeutic benefit in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Daily treatment with OB-002 altered immune gene transcription in the lungs, and reduced pathology following infection, but did not prevent weight loss or viral replication in the lungs of infected animals, even in combination with the antiviral drug remdesivir. Our data suggest that targeting the CCR5-CCL5 pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters is insufficient to significantly impact disease development in this model.">

        <tr id="The betacoronavirus genus contains five of the seven human coronaviruses, making it a particularly critical area of research to prepare for future viral emergence. We utilized three human betacoronaviruses, one from each subgenus—HCoV-OC43 (embecovirus), SARS-CoV-2 (sarbecovirus), and MERS-CoV (merbecovirus)—, to study betacoronavirus interactions with the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of the integrated stress response (ISR)/unfolded protein response (UPR). The PERK pathway becomes activated by an abundance of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α and translational attenuation. We demonstrate that MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV-2 all activate PERK and induce responses downstream of p-eIF2α, while only SARS-CoV-2 induces detectable p-eIF2α during infection. Using a small molecule inhibitor of eIF2α dephosphorylation, we provide evidence that MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 maximize viral replication through p-eIF2α dephosphorylation. Interestingly, genetic ablation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD34) expression, an inducible protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-interacting partner targeting eIF2α for dephosphorylation, did not significantly alter HCoV-OC43 or SARS-CoV-2 replication, while siRNA knockdown of the constitutive PP1 partner, constitutive repressor of eIF2α phosphorylation (CReP), dramatically reduced HCoV-OC43 replication. Combining GADD34 knockout with CReP knockdown had the maximum impact on HCoV-OC43 replication, while SARS-CoV-2 replication was unaffected. Overall, we conclude that eIF2α dephosphorylation is critical for efficient protein production and replication during MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 infection. SARS-CoV-2, however, appears to be insensitive to p-eIF2α and, during infection, may even downregulate dephosphorylation to limit host translation.">

Using transcriptional profiles we analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV2 infection and/or vaccination in pregnant people and their infants longitudinally Transcriptome changes in pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination Modular analysis of pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination compared with healthy uninfected controls. Red dot: overexpression, blue dot: underexpression, white/empty space no difference vs controls Methods Multicenter observational study of SARS-CoV-2-infected and/or vaccinated pregnant people and their infants. Pregnant people (infected [n=91], vaccinated [n=42], infected-and-vaccinated [n=14], controls [n=22]) and their infants (n=81, 38,14, 11, respectively) were included. Maternal blood samples were collected during different trimesters and at delivery. Infant blood samples were collected longitudinally from birth (< 72 hours), at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months of age. Whole blood RNA was extracted for RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data analyzed with R Transcriptional analysis of immune system development in early life Modular gene expression scores were analyzed longitudinally of individual infant samples. Red: higher expression, white: lower expression. D1-3: days 1 to 3, W1: week 1, M1: month 1, M3: month 3, M6: month 6 Results Compared with uninfected controls, interferon and plasma cells genes were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute infection (< 14 days), but underexpressed with earlier infection or vaccination during pregnancy (Figure 1). Newborns < 72 h of age (from all groups) showed significantly increased expression of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and inflammation genes. Expression of T/cytotoxic cell genes started to be observed at 1 week, while expression of B cells, plasma cells and interferon genes was observed at 3 months of age (Figure 2). Quantitative gene set enrichment analysis showed that compared to controls, infants from infected and/or vaccinated mothers had increased expression of interferon, while neutrophil, and adaptive immunity genes were decreased (Figure 3) SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination of pregnant people shaped immune profiles of their infants Fold changes of gene sets in infants compared to controls are shown (adjusted p-value <0.01) from quantitative gene set enrichment (QuSAGE) analysis. Red: overexpression, blue: underexpression. Infant groups are defined by maternal infection and/or vaccination status at delivery. Conclusion Interferon and plasma cells related pathways were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute COVID-19, while vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier in pregnancy were associated with under-expression of both innate and adaptive immunity genes. The infant immune system changed rapidly in the first few days of life, as different immune programs followed separate time trajectories.

        <tr id="Multinucleated cells are present in lung tissues of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Although the spike protein can cause the fusion of infected cells and ACE2-expressing cells to form syncytia and induce damage, how host cell responses to this damage and the role of DNA damage response (DDR) signals in cell fusion are still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the fusion of homologous and heterologous cells expressing ACE2 in vitro models, focusing on the protein levels of ATR and ATM, the major kinases responding to DNA damage, and their substrates CHK1 and CHK2. We found that both homologous and heterologous cell fusion activated the ATR-CHK1 and ATM-CHK2 signaling axis and induced the aggregation of γH2AX, 53BP1 and RAD51 in syncytia. In addition, siRNA or inhibitors of ATM and ATR suppressed syncytia formation by decreasing the level of S protein. These results showed the important role of DDR in stabilizing the S protein and in favoring its induction of cell fusion and syncytium formation, suggesting that the virus exploits the host DDR to facilitate its spread among infected cells.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019, was caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a shell virus containing a single positive chain genome and using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The targeting of SARS-CoV-2 on several tissues expressing ACE2 explains the multifactorial pattern of symptoms: fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue and shortness of breath. These symptoms do not always stop after COVID-19, and symptoms may reappear within 12 weeks, which indicates the development of post-COVID syndrome (long COVID). Due to the extensive symptoms and comorbidity of patients, the clinical diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome is difficult. The aim of the study is to identify pathognomonic indices of biochemical blood analysis in convalescents, indicating the development of post-COVID syndrome. 
Patients and study design: a retrospective observational one-moment study of 373 case histories and outpatient records was conducted for the patients exposed to COVID-19 not later than 12 weeks ago. The initial course of the disease (disease) was assessed using the WHO Clinical Progression Scale. The severity of post-COVID syndrome (clinical outcomes) was assessed on the functional status scale after COVID-19 (PCFS). All subjects are divided into four groups, the names of which reflect the severity of COVID-19 and the severity of the post-ovoid condition: 1st group, “mild COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 2nd group, “mild COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”; 3rd group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 4th group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”. The sample was described by calculating the median (Me) values and interquartile range expressed as Q1 and Q3 (Q0.25-Q0.75). The reliability of the differences between independent samples was assessed with nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test and the Student’s t-test. 
Upon evaluation of clinical blood biochemistry, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in group 1 was higher than in groups 2 and 4, the aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) level in group 2 was higher than in groups 1 and 3. The indexes of total cholesterol and LDL did not show statistically significant differences between the groups. Creatinine levels in group 3 are higher than in group 1, being lower in group 4 than in other groups. Significant differences were observed upon qualitative assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP). There were 2-3 times more subjects with elevated CRP levels in groups 2 and 4 than in group 1. 
A minimal biochemical profile, including an assessment of the level of transaminases and creatinine, a qualitative or quantitative assessment of C-reactive protein, may indicate development of chronic inflammation. Patients of this group need to undergo an additional examination, e.g., general urine analysis and determination of albumin level in urine, dynamic GFR calculation, in order to prevent the development of persistent renal impairment.">

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection induces interferon (IFN) response by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we show that the bulk of the IFN-I release comes from pDC sensing of infected cells and not cell-free virions. Physical contact (or conjugates) between pDCs and infected cells is mediated through CD54-CD11a engagement, and such conjugate formation is required for efficient IFN-I production. Interestingly, CD11a is inducible on infected epithelial cells when they are co-cultured with PBMCs, thus allowing for potentially bidirectional cross-talks between CD54 and CD11a, which further amplify the sensing. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) are sensed less efficiently than the Wuhan ancestral strain (LSPQ1), but the mechanisms driving the defect are different among the VOCs. CD11a induction on infected cells is correlated with their ability to form cell conjugates with pDCs. Impaired sensing of the Alpha variant is linked to reduced CD11a induction on infected cells and to fewer conjugates formed with pDCs. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into how SARS-CoV-2-infected cells are sensed by pDCs and reveal that this process is targeted by some VOCs to limit IFN-I production.


IMPORTANCE
Type I interferons (IFN-I) represent an important component of the host's innate defense against initial SARS-CoV-2 infections. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce large quantities of IFN-I upon recognition of viral particles or infected cells. This study shows that pDCs sense infected cells more efficiently than viral particles, leading to a higher production of IFN-I. Physical contact between a pDC and an infected cell is critical to this process; the interaction is mediated via CD11a and ICAM-1 complex and potentially is bidirectional. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have evolved to limit the IFN response through different mechanisms. For the Alpha variant, reduced level of CD11a on infected cells is linked to less contact with pDCs and decreased IFN-I release. Overall, our study characterizes some of the early steps involved in pDC-mediated response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and shows that these processes are targeted by VOCs to likely limit IFN-I response and enhance viral spread.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) are a topic of debate. This study examined the presence of SARS-CoV-2 microRNA (miRNA)-like small RNAs in extracellular fluids and their potential link to PASC by using a quantitative stem-loop RT-PCR MiRNA assay. Initially, it was demonstrated that three previously identified SARS-CoV-2 miRNA-like small RNAs, specifically svRNA 1 and 2 and miR-07a, were significantly expressed in infected cells in vitro and released into the supernatant following infection by different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Then, the expression of three SARS-CoV-2 small RNAs was studied in both nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and sera from 24 patients at their initial COVID-19 diagnosis (T0) and in sera collected 91 to 193 days post-diagnosis (T1). Notably, 11 out of 24 patients (46%) reported PASC consequences. All NPS samples showed SARS-CoV-2 small RNA expression with an altered cytokine network during acute infection, but it did not correlate with PASC outcomes. Serum samples had similar small RNA statuses, though PASC patients, notably at T1, but not at T0, displayed reduced overall positivity compared to those without PASC. The host target expression of SARS-CoV-2 small RNAs was not significantly different between groups. This suggests a need for further research into SARS-CoV-2 small RNA and its role in viral behavior and PASC consequences.">

        <tr id="The spatial organization of adaptive immune cells within lymph nodes is critical for understanding immune responses during infection and disease. Here, we introduce AIR-SPACE, an integrative approach that combines high-resolution spatial transcriptomics with paired, high-fidelity long-read sequencing of T and B cell receptors. This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), is a major concern due to its astonishing prevalence and high fatality rate, especially among elderly people. Patients suffering from COVID‐19 may exhibit immunosuppression in the initial stage of infection, while a cytokine storm can occur when the disease progresses to a severe stage. This inopportune immune rhythm not only makes patients more susceptible to the virus but also leads to numerous complications resulting from the excessive production of inflammatory factors. A20, which is widely accepted as a pivotal regulator of inflammation, has been shown to be implicated in the processes of antiviral responses and immunosuppression. Thus, A20 may participate in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. Methods This narrative literature review summarizes recent evidence on the mechanisms of A20 in regulating the pathological processes of COVID‐19. We also downloaded single‐cell RNA‐seq data sets from healthy individuals and patients with varying severities of COVID‐19 from the NCBI GEO database to further dissect A20's regulatory mechanisms of these intricate cytokine pathways that are closely associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Results A20 might be one of the most critical anti‐infectious and anti‐inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19. It effectively suppresses the immune damage and inflammatory storm caused by viral infection. Conclusions Understanding the relationship between A20‐regulated signaling pathways and pathological processes of COVID‐19 can provide insight into potential targets for intervention. Precise regulation of A20 to induce antiviral activity and an anti‐inflammatory response could mediate the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and could become an effective treatment.">

While anti-Aβ antibodies provide hope in targeting Aβ plaques in the brain, there still remains a lack of understanding regarding the cellular responses to these antibodies in the brain. In this study, we sought to identify the acute effects of anti-Aβ antibodies on immune responses. To determine cellular changes due to anti-Aβ antibody exposure, we intracranially injected 14 mo APP male and female mice with anti-Aβ IgG1 (6E10) or control IgG1 into the cortex. After 24 h or 3 d, we harvested the cortex and performed a glial cell-enriched preparation for single-cell sequencing. Cell types, proportions, and cell-to-cell signaling were evaluated between the two injection conditions and two acute timepoints. We identified 23 unique cell clusters including microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, oligos/OPCs, immune cells, and unknown. The anti-Aβ antibody-injected cortices revealed more ligand–receptor (L–R) communications between cell types, as well as stronger communications at only 24 h. At 3 d, while there were more L–R communications for the anti-Aβ antibody condition, the strength of these connections was stronger in the control IgG condition. We also found evidence of an initial and strong communication emphasis in microglia-to-nonparenchymal immune cells at 24 h, specifically in the TGFβ signaling pathway. We identify several pathways that are specific to anti-Aβ antibody exposure at acute timepoints. These data lay the groundwork for understanding the brain's unique response to anti-Aβ antibodies.">

Neuroinflammation is believed to be a key contributor, but its dynamics and consequences for brain function remain poorly understood. Here, we performed comprehensive longitudinal profiling, from 6 hours to 1 year after irradiation (IR) of the mouse hippocampus, using transcriptomic, protein and histological analyses. We identified a delayed microglial response coupling interferon signaling to mitotic progression, and a subsequent induction of temporally regulated subtypes. IR rewired the parenchymal phagocyte profiles due to progressive microglial loss, failure of repopulation through self-renewal and compensatory generation of microglia-like cells derived from peripheral monocytes. These findings were confirmed in autopsied human brain. Finally, we demonstrate two phases of neuronal asynchrony, an early one associated with inflammation and a late one associated with synaptic aberrant regulation. These results provide comprehensive, longitudinal insights into microglia responses that can aid tailoring therapies to preserve cognition in cancer survivors.">

        <tr id="Abstract: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) caused by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pose significant global health challenges, particularly for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Substantial evidence indicates that acute viral infections can manipulate the host’s epigenome through mechanisms like DNA methylation and histone modifications as part of the immune response. These epigenetic alterations can persist beyond the acute phase, influencing long-term immunity and susceptibility to subsequent infections. Post-infection modulation of the host epigenome may help distinguish infected from uninfected individuals and predict disease severity. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments and preventive strategies for viral ARIs. This review highlights the critical role of epigenetic modifications following viral ARIs in regulating the host’s innate immune defense mechanisms. We discuss the implications of these modifications for diagnosing, preventing, and treating viral infections, contributing to the advancement of precision medicine. Recent studies have identified specific epigenetic changes, such as hypermethylation of interferon-stimulated genes in severe COVID-19 cases, which could serve as biomarkers for early detection and disease progression. Additionally, epigenetic therapies, including inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases, show promise in modulating the immune response and improving patient outcomes. Overall, this review provides valuable insights into the epigenetic landscape of viral ARIs, extending beyond traditional genetic perspectives. These insights are essential for advancing diagnostic techniques and developing innovative treatments to address the growing threat of emerging viruses causing ARIs globally.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The majority of COVID-19 infections in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological (Heme-Onc) diagnoses are mild with good outcome compared to adults. Postulated reasons include cross-protection from immunity against seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV’s), subdued inflammatory responses in children than in adults and differences in humoral and T-cell responses. The objectives of this study are to compare antibody responses against HCoV’s, anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral, T-cell, and inflammatory profiles between Heme-Onc children with COVID-19 and control groups. Methods Binding IgG antibodies against Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2, four HCoV’s (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), quantitative levels of 21 cytokines and 9 chemokines (multiplexed solid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay by Meso Scale Diagnostics/MSD) were compared among five cohorts: 1) children with Heme-Onc diagnoses and COVID-19 (n = 41) 2) healthy children with COVID-19 (n = 21) 3) adults with COVID-19 (n = 14) 4) children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [n = 23] and 5) healthy children without COVID-19 (n = 12). Additionally, T-cell responses against S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using ELISpot in Heme-Onc children a group of healthy children COVID-19. Results Anti-S antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV were significantly lower in children in Heme-Onc and healthy children with COVID-19 compared to adults with COVID-19 (Figure 1). The concentration of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in Heme-Onc and healthy children compared to adults with COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. The responder T-cell frequency varied between 0 and 860/100,000 PBMC at study enrollment in children with Heme-Onc diagnoses. Conclusion In this single-center study, cross-protection from HCoV antibodies is an unlikely mechanism to explain mild COVID-19 in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological diagnoses. Subdued inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be one of the factors for the mild COVID-19 disease phenotype in children.

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a plethora of long-COVID symptoms for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe symptoms, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. Methods: This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Results: Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group who previously exhibited different symptoms (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered groups, significantly elevated in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. Following vaccination, the recovered group who experienced disease history showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p<0.005). Notably, antibody titers are negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p<0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days of two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, the titers were comparable to the baseline titer, indicating the importance of vaccination and booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infectious history. To ensure long-term respiratory health, this study emphasizes the significance of evaluating pulmonary function in those who might have contained asymptomatic COVID-19 infections as well as those who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, these findings underscore the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history as a key strategy in pandemic preparedness. Conclusions: To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="The interface between the brain surface and the adjacent meninges is a selective barrier regulating fluid, protein and immune cell exchange between the CNS and periphery. However, the cell types that form this important interface are not yet fully defined. To address this limitation, we have used single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell spatial transcriptomics together with morphological lineage tracing and immunostaining to analyze the adult murine cortex. We show that the cortical interface is comprised of three major cell types, leptomeningeal cells, border astrocytes and tissue-resident macrophages. On the peripheral side the interface is comprised of transcriptionally-distinct PDGFRα-positive leptomeningeal mesenchymal cells that are intermingled with macrophages. This leptomeningeal pial layer is lined by a population of transcriptionally-distinct border astrocytes. The interface neighborhood is rich in growth factor mRNAs, including many leptomeningeal ligands predicted to act on both the border astrocytes and macrophages. On the CNS side of the interface is the relatively cell-sparse cortical layer one containing interneurons, microglia, parenchymal astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes. Except for the border astrocytes, layer one cells are not closely-associated with the interface, suggesting that secreted ligands may be the major way the brain interface communicates with the underlying cortical parenchyma. Thus, our data provide a molecular/cellular resource describing the brain interface cell types and their interactions, thereby enabling future studies asking how this distinct cellular compartment regulates CNS:periphery interactions. Significance Statement Recent years have seen significant progress in identifying the diverse cell types within the meningeal space. However, the mechanisms by which these cells interact with glial and neuronal cells in layer one of the adult murine cortex remain poorly understood. During development, communication between radial precursors and meningeal layers is crucial for proper brain formation, but the role of this interaction in adulthood is still unclear. Additionally, how resident immune cells in the leptomeningeal space signal to layer one cortical cells or meningeal mesenchymal cells during homeostasis remains an open question. Understanding the identity, location, and interactions of these cells is essential for unraveling the complex dynamics at this critical brain interface.">

        <tr id="Imbalance of airway proteases and antiproteases has been implicated in diseases such as COPD and environmental exposures including cigarette smoke and ozone. To initiate infection, endogenous proteases are commandeered by respiratory viruses upon encountering the airway epithelium. The airway proteolytic environment likely contains redundant antiproteases and proteases with diverse catalytic mechanisms, however a proteomic profile of these enzymes and inhibitors in airway samples has not been reported. The objective of this study was to first profile extracellular proteases and antiproteases using human airway epithelial cell cultures and ex vivo nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) samples. Secondly, we present an optimized method for probing the proteolytic environment of airway surface liquid samples (in vitro and ex vivo) using fluorogenic peptides modeling the cleavage sites of respiratory viruses. We detected 48 proteases in the apical wash of cultured human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) (n = 6) and 57 in NELF (n = 13) samples from healthy human subjects using mass-spectrometry based proteomics. Additionally, we detected 29 and 48 antiproteases in the HNEC apical washes and NELF, respectively. We observed large interindividual variability in rate of cleavage of an Influenza H1 peptide in the ex vivo clinical samples. Since protease and antiprotease levels have been found to be altered in the airways of smokers, we compared proteolytic cleavage in ex vivo nasal lavage samples from male/female smokers and non-smokers. There was a statistically significant increase in proteolysis of Influenza H1 in NLF from male smokers compared to female smokers. Furthermore, we measured cleavage of the S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 Delta peptides in various airway samples, suggesting the method could be used for other viruses of public health relevance. This assay presents a direct and efficient method of evaluating the proteolytic environment of human airway samples in assessment of therapeutic treatment, exposure, or underlying disease.">

        <tr id="Background Microglia and astrocytes have been implicated as central mediators of neuroinflammatory processes in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results Microglia–astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-α/IL-1β elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.">

        <tr id="Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are a major cause of morbidity largely due to lack of prevention and inadequate treatments. While mortality from viral CNS infections is significant, nearly two thirds of the patients survive. Thus, it is important to understand how the human CNS can successfully control virus infection and recover. Since it is not possible to study the human CNS throughout the course of viral infection at the cellular level, here we analyzed a non-lethal viral infection in the CNS of nonhuman primates (NHPs). We inoculated NHPs intracerebrally with a high dose of La Crosse virus (LACV), a bunyavirus that can infect neurons and cause encephalitis primarily in children, but with a very low (≤ 1%) mortality rate. To profile the CNS response to LACV infection, we used an integrative approach that was based on comprehensive analyses of (i) spatiotemporal dynamics of virus replication, (ii) identification of types of infected neurons, (iii) spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and (iv) morphological and functional changes in CNS intrinsic and extrinsic cells. We identified the location, timing, and functional repertoire of optimal transcriptional and translational regulation of the primate CNS in response to virus infection of neurons. These CNS responses involved a well-coordinated spatiotemporal interplay between astrocytes, lymphocytes, microglia, and CNS-border macrophages. Our findings suggest a multifaceted program governing an optimal CNS response to virus infection with specific events coordinated in space and time. This allowed the CNS to successfully control the infection by rapidly clearing the virus from infected neurons, mitigate damage to neurophysiology, activate and terminate immune responses in a timely manner, resolve inflammation, restore homeostasis, and initiate tissue repair. An increased understanding of these processes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve outcomes of viral CNS diseases in humans.">

        <tr id="The long-term effects of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations on adaptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive three-year longitudinal study examining T cell and antibody responses in 78 vaccinated individuals without reported symptomatic infections. We observed distinct dynamics in Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses across multiple vaccine doses. While antibody titers incrementally increased and stabilized with each booster, T cell responses rapidly plateaued, maintaining remarkable stability across CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Notably, approximately 30% of participants showed CD4+ T cell reactivity to non-Spike antigens, consistent with asymptomatic infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a diverse landscape of Spike-specific T cell phenotypes, with no evidence of increased exhaustion or significant functional impairment. However, qualitative changes were observed in individuals with evidence of asymptomatic infection, exhibiting unique immunological characteristics, including increased frequencies of Th17-like CD4+ T cells and GZMKhi/IFNR CD8+ T cell subsets. Remarkably, repeated vaccinations in this group were associated with a progressive increase in regulatory T cells, potentially indicating a balanced immune response that may mitigate immunopathology. By regularly stimulating T cell memory, boosters contribute to a stable and enhanced immune response, which may provide better protection against symptomatic infections.">

        <tr id="Aims/Purpose: Long COVID is a multi systemic condition that occurs in some patients after acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. It has been hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction might be involved in the disease process. Assessment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) in the retina is a non‐invasive method to measure endothelial function. Briefly, stimulation of the retina with flicker light usually leads to a significant increase in retinal blood flow. This mechanism has been found to be disturbed in diseases that are associated with endothelial dysfunction.In this context, we investigated whether changes in NVC can be found in patients with long COVID compared to healthy subjects.Methods: We included patients who had a previously confirmed COVID‐19 infection and were diagnosed with long COVID according to WHO guidelines. Healthy subjects had no history of COVID‐19 infection and were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 seroprevalence. To assess NVC, diffuse flicker light stimulation was performed over 60s using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA, Imedos, Germany). We calculated the percentage increase in mean vessel diameter of arteries and veins in response to the flicker light relative to the baseline diameter size.Results: Fifteen (15) patients with long COVID and 11 healthy subjects were included in the current study. During stimulation with flicker light, the diameters of retinal arteries and veins significantly increased in patients with long COVID (3.1 ± 3.5% for arteries and 4.8 ± 2.9% for veins, p < 0.001 vs. baseline each). The same was found for healthy controls (increase in arteries: 3.4 ± 3.0%, increase in veins: 4.2 ± 1.8%, p < 0.001 vs. baseline each). No difference between the two groups in the flicker response was observed (p = 0.792 for arteries and p = 0.579 for veins).Conclusions: In our small study, NVC was not altered in patients with long COVID compared to healthy subjects. However, further studies including larger sample sizes are needed to assess vascular issues in long COVID patients to better understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.">

        <tr id="HIV infection exerts profound and long-lasting neurodegenerative effects on the central nervous system (CNS) that can persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we used single-nucleus multiome sequencing to map the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of postmortem human brains from 13 healthy individuals and 20 individuals with HIV who have a history of treatment with ART. Our study spanned three distinct regions—the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and ventral striatum—enabling a comprehensive exploration of region-specific and cross-regional perturbations. We found widespread and persistent HIV-associated transcriptional and epigenetic alterations across multiple cell types. Detailed analyses of microglia revealed state changes marked by immune activation and metabolic dysregulation, while integrative multiomic profiling of astrocytes identified multiple subpopulations, including a reactive subpopulation unique to HIV-infected brains. These findings suggest that cells from people with HIV exhibit molecular shifts that may underlie ongoing neuroinflammation and CNS dysfunction. Furthermore, cell–cell communication analyses uncovered dysregulated and pro-inflammatory interactions among glial populations, underscoring the multifaceted and enduring impact of HIV on the brain milieu. Collectively, our comprehensive atlas of HIV-associated brain changes reveals distinct glial cell states with signatures of pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic dysregulation, providing a framework for developing targeted therapies for HIV-associated neurological dysfunction.">

 Evidence suggest that about 10-30% of individuals with COVID-19 develop a chronic condition following the acute phase, now referred to as the post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC) or long COVID1,2. Dysregulation of the immune system and chronic inflammation, which are among the primary drivers of PASC3, are at the heart of immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) pathology. As PASC still remains underexplored in the IMID population, we aimed to carry out a population-based cohort study to estimate the risk of PASC in patients with IMIDs compared to those without a recorded diagnosis of an IMID.



 We used the Danish national registers to identify all individuals with a recorded positive SARS-CoV-2 test between 01 January 2020 and 01 January 2022. Individuals with IMIDs including Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondylarthritis (SpA), and psoriasis were identified using ICD-10 codes and medication with indication (only for psoriasis) before 01 January 2020. The IMID and non-IMID groups were matched (1:2) on age, sex, municipality of residence, and calendar period. With the first positive date as index, individuals were followed up until a PASC diagnosis, emigration, death or end of the study period (31 July 2022), whichever is earliest. If an individual from the non-IMID group is diagnosed with an IMID, they are censored. Cox proportional hazard regression was carried out to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with adjustments for age, sex and Charlson Comorbidity Index in all analyses. Subgroup analysis by vaccination status, hospitalization for COVID-19, IMID medication, IMID group, and SARS-CoV-2 variant were carried out.



 We compared 25,889 IMID patients to 51,778 individuals without an IMID for the risk of PASC. The median age was 48 (IQR: 35, 61) and 56% were women. Psoriasis was the largest group constituting 47% of the IMID group. During a median follow-up of 7.7(IQR:7.1-16.3) months, a total of 753 cases of PASC were reported in the entire cohort. The Cox proportional hazard regression showed an increased risk of PASC in the IMID group (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: (1.30-1.74)) compared to the non-IMID group. SpA (HR: 1.91, 95% CI:(1.21-3.01)), RA (HR: 1.72, 95% CI:(1.25-2.37)) and psoriasis (HR: 1.50, 95% CI:(1.21-1.85)) were individually associated with an increased risk of PASC.



 This cohort study using nationwide registers showed an increased risk of PASC in individuals with an IMID and in spondylarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis individually. The results underline the need for clinicians to be aware of the chronic impact of early SARS-CoV-2 infection that IMID patients are living with at present.

Hence, microglia are regarded as a potential therapeutic target in CNS diseases, resulting in an increased demand for reliable in vitro models. Two human microglia cell lines (HMC3 and C20) are being used in multiple in vitro studies, however, the knowledge of their biological and immunological characteristics remains limited.

Using high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, we have examined in-depth proteomic profiles of non-stimulated and LPS or IFN-γ challenged HMC3 and C20 cells. Our findings reveal that HMC3 cells responded to both treatments through upregulation of immune, metabolic, and antiviral pathways, while C20 cells showed a response associated with mitochondrial and immune activities. Additionally, the secretome analysis demonstrated that both cell lines release IL-6 in response to LPS, while IFN-γ treatment resulted in altered kynurenine pathway activity, highlighting distinct immune and metabolic adaptations.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected individuals showed either mild symptoms or were paucisymptomatic, with severe impact on human health, revealing heightened risk and direct effects on health. Among various factors contributing to complications, bacterial and fungal co-infection remains very common and is highly lethal. This narrative review aims to focus on the collective role of gut microbiota and mycobiota in COVID-19. Fungal infection has been identified as a key risk factor for the spread of COVID-19 and mortality. Gut mycobiomes diversity and abundance also vary due to the different types of SARS-CoV-2 variant infection. Their cross-talk plays a vital role in immune regulation and disease severity, with an emphasis on understanding the altered condition as a predictive marker. On the other hand, the gut microbiome is well known for shaping metabolic functions, generating immune responses, and deciphering the signal to decide the healthy state and disease condition of an individual. Immune response during COVID-19 infection was also linked with metabolites produced by the gut microflora, specifically amino acids, sugar metabolites, and neurotransmitters. The cross-talk between gut microbiota and gut mycobiota for clinical implications in terms of early detection, identification of the disease severity, and even therapeutic alternatives will open newer avenues. A deep dive understanding of the cross-talk between the microbiome and mycobiome, and their role in immune response will take scientific discovery knowledge to develop gut-targeted safe therapeutic approaches in the form of FMT (fecal microbiota transplantation) probiotics, peptides, antibacterial, and antifungal metabolites.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The pathogenesis of Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) following mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, ∼10-35% of COVID-19 patients experience long COVID (LC), in which often debilitating symptoms persist for at least three months. Elucidating the biologic underpinnings of LC could identify therapeutic opportunities. We utilized machine learning methods on biologic analytes and patient reported outcome surveys provided over 12 months after hospital discharge from >500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the IMPACC cohort to identify a multi-omics “recovery factor”. IMPACC participants who experienced LC had lower recovery factor scores compared to participants without LC. Biologic characterization revealed increased levels of plasma proteins associated with inflammation, elevated transcriptional signatures of heme metabolism, and decreased androgenic steroids in LC patients. The recovery factor was also associated with altered circulating immune cell frequencies. Notably, recovery factor scores were predictive of LC occurrence in patients as early as hospital admission, irrespective of acute disease severity. Thus, the recovery factor identifies patients at risk of LC early after SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals LC biomarkers and potential treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has presented formidable challenges to global health since its emergence in late 2019. While primarily known for respiratory symptoms, it can also affect the ocular surface. This review summarizes the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on ocular surface immunity and inflammation, focusing on infection mechanisms, immune responses, and clinical manifestations. Ocular symptoms, though uncommon, include conjunctivitis, dry eye, and blurred vision. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in ocular surface epithelial cells, facilitating viral entry, replication, and local dissemination. The innate immune responses involving corneal epithelial cells and immune cells are discussed, alongside mechanisms of antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. The review also examines the roles of cytokines and chemokines in mediating ocular surface inflammation and explores the impact of cytokine storms and chronic inflammation on ocular health. Additionally, the interplay between systemic and ocular immune responses is highlighted, analyzing how systemic COVID-19 inflammation influences ocular surface health. These insights underscore the broader implications of COVID-19 beyond localized ocular infection. By consolidating current findings, this review aims to guide preventive and therapeutic strategies while identifying directions for future research to mitigate the ocular consequences of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 epidemic in recent years has been produced by various coronavirus strains that nearly destroyed world health policies and economics. Emerging viral strains exac-erbated the pandemic. Huge investments have been made in preventative vaccines to combat the disease, but the genetic instability of these viruses has hampered their usefulness. However, in addition to traditional therapeutic approaches, nutraceuticals have been considered effica-cious in preventing and or treating COVID-19 and post-COVID syndrome. In this context, nutraceuticals such as vitamins or dietary supplements including multiple vitamins and miner-als and propolis have been widely studied for their significant impact on viral respiratory dis-eases like SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Some of these nutraceuticals having antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory properties have been highly recommended for use as an adjunct option to moderate the adverse effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we intend to present the recent understanding and converse scientific implications for the use of nutraceutical antioxidants such as vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and polyphenols like bee propolis, in the management of viral respiratory diseases and post-COVID-19 syn-drome. Future challenges and limitations regarding the use and bioavailability of these ingre-dients, and dose-response studies are further emphasized.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in nearly 630 million cases and 6.60 million fatalities globally, as of November 2022. SARS-CoV-2, a species of the Coronaviridae family, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome as well as four main structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) required for viral entrance into target cells. The spike protein (S) influences this entry through interactions with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized numerous variants of concern (VOCs) that involve Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, having multiple mutations within the spike protein, altering infection rates and immunity evasion. The Omicron variant, featuring 50 mutations, mainly within the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), has a higher transmission rate as compared to other variants. This study focused on two recent Omicron subvariants, XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1, which are known for their high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor. Utilizing an in silico strategy, a total of 1.65 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to assess the stability as well as binding details of these subvariants along with the wild-type Omicron variants. The comprehensive structural stability of the spike protein–hACE2 complexes was evaluated by using numerous parameters including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, the binding free energies have been determined using the MM-GBSA approach to provide insights into the binding affinities of these variants. Evaluation revealed that the unbound mutant frameworks (SM and TM) displayed higher degrees of instability in comparison to the wild-type (WT) Omicron variant. In contrast, the WT–hACE2 of the Omicron variant complex was less stable than the subvariants, SM–hACE2 and TM–hACE2 complexes. Binding free energy calculations employing MM-PBSA disclosed higher binding energy values for the SM–hACE2 and TM–hACE2 complexes, suggesting a more stable and ordered binding interaction. The observed increase in transmissibility of the new XBB.1.5 and CH.1.1 subvariants, in comparison to the wild-type Omicron, appears to be due to this greater stability and ordered binding.">

We have defined fifteen subclasses, from precursor to mature cells, four of which are disease-associated. These PD-specific populations are characterized by the overexpression of heat shock proteins and distinct expression signatures, including immune responses and myelination alterations. We have also identified disruptions in cell communication and oligodendrocyte development, evidenced by changes in neurotransmitter receptors expression and cell adhesion molecules. These transcriptomic changes correlated with impaired myelin integrity and altered oligodendrocyte distribution in the striatum.

Research results on the immune response and cytokine profile in children with the new coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 are contradictory and insufficient, which necessitates the need to understand the nature of the course of the disease depending on age and severity of the infection. The importance of assessing risks and predicting the consequences of a new coronavirus infection in childhood makes the study of serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines relevant.The aim. To study the level of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in newborns during the acute period of a new coronavirus infection to determine the characteristics of the immune response and identify prognostic criteria for the course of the infectious process.Materials and methods. The article presents the results of a study of the level of pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) in newborns (n  =  44) hospitalized with a confirmed new coronavirus infection of varying severity. The study was conducted during the acute period of COVID-19.Results. Cytokine concentrations in the blood serum of newborns were determined by enzyme immunoassay. In newborns in the acute period of a new coronavirus infection, regardless of the severity, there is a decrease in serum concentrations of interleukin-1β, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor α, interferon (INF)  γ and  CRP compared with the control group. The level of INF-α in the blood serum of newborns of both the main and control groups did not have significant differences.Conclusions. The cytokine profile in newborns with the new coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 may be due to inhibition of the innate immune system, which requires further research in this direction and increased pediatric attention to this category of children.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is intricately related to the reprogramming of host metabolism. However, existing studies have mainly focused on peripheral blood samples and barely identified specific metabolites that are critically involved in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current small-scale study, we performed metabolic profiling in plasma (n = 61) and paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples (n = 20) using parallel two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS). In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-α production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that the levels of indoxyl sulfate could potentially serve as a functional biomarker to monitor COVID-19 disease progression and guide more individualized treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, poses a significant global health challenge, especially among high-risk populations. This study investigates the temporal dynamics of pulmonary gene expression during S. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia using a murine model to elucidate host-pathogen interactions and identify potential biomarkers of disease severity. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we analyzed lung tissues at early (1h, 8h) and acute infection (2d, 3d), as well as post-resolution (30d) time-points. At 2 days post-infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed heightened innate immune responses, including chemokine and interferon signaling pathways. By 30 days post-infection, gene expression profiles and histological changes normalized, reflecting resolution of inflammation. Stratifying mice into recovered, sick, and moribund phenotypes during the acute infection phase highlighted significant transcriptional distinctions, including upregulated pro-inflammatory genes and Schlafen family members. Arginase 1 emerged as a predictive marker of disease severity, with elevated expression detectable as early as 8 hours post-infection. Comparative analyses revealed significant overlap between transcriptional responses in our model and those from a Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia model, implicating conserved pathways, such as IL-17 and Toll-like receptor signaling. Additionally, murine DEGs correlated with human plasma proteins associated with severe CAP, including CCL8 and CD14, suggesting translational relevance. This study underscores phase-specific transcriptional reprogramming during pneumococcal pneumonia and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in severe CAP cases.">

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease, characterized by impaired wound repair, tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Immune system may participate in the development and progression of the disease as indicated by altered activity in IPF sufferers. This study investigates the immune response to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IPF compared to healthy controls, with a particular focus on evaluation of antibody responses, interferon-gamma release, cytokine profiling and a broad panel of immune cell subpopulations. IPF patients without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 had undetectable levels of anti-N IgG antibodies, highlighting their lack of previous infection. After vaccination, IPF patients showed a significant increase in anti-S1 IgG and IgA antibodies, though their levels were lower compared to healthy controls and convalescent IPF patients. Additionally, IPF patients exhibited altered proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) before and after vaccination. Specifically, IPF patients had higher percentages of Tregs with a Th2 phenotype and Th17 Tregs, along with reduced proportions of Th1/17 Tregs. Teffs in IPF patients showed a decrease in Th1-like and Th2-like populations after vaccination. Moreover, IPF patients demonstrated elevated populations of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) before vaccination and increased levels of γδ Tc cells throughout the study. Alterations in cytokine profiles were also observed, IPF patients showed higher levels of IL-6 and IL-22 compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest a distinct immune response in IPF patients to the COVID-19 vaccine, characterized by differences in antibody production, T cell differentiation and cytokine secretion compared to healthy individuals.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown. Methods and results In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients. Conclusion We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="Maladaptive host metabolic responses to infection are emerging as major determinants of infectious disease pathogenesis. However, the factors regulating these metabolic changes within tissues remain poorly understood. In this study, we used toxoplasmosis, as a prototypical example of a disease regulated by strong type I immune responses, to assess the relative roles of local parasite burden, local tissue inflammation and the microbiome in shaping local tissue metabolism during acute and chronic infection. Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This protozoan infects the small intestine and then disseminates to nearly every organ in the acute stage of infection, before establishing chronic infection in the skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and brain. We compared metabolism in eleven sampling sites in C57BL/6 mice during the acute and chronic stage of T. gondii infection. Strikingly, significant metabolic changes were observed in the large intestine and colon during chronic infection, organs not associated with T. gondii persistence. Overall, major spatial mismatches were observed between metabolic perturbation and local parasite burden for both disease stages. In contrast, a stronger association with indicators of type I immune responses was observed, indicating a tighter relationship between metabolic perturbation and local immunity, than with local parasite burden. In addition, we observed significant changes in microbiota composition with infection, and candidate microbial origins for multiple metabolites impacted by infection. These findings highlight the metabolic consequences of toxoplasmosis across different organs, and their regulators. Importance Inflammation is a major driver of tissue perturbation. However, the signals driving these changes on a tissue-intrinsic and molecular level are poorly understood. This study evaluated tissue-specific metabolic perturbations across eleven sampling sites following systemic murine infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Results revealed relationships between differential metabolite enrichment and variables including inflammatory signals, pathogen burden and commensal microbial communities. These data will inform hypotheses about the signals driving specific metabolic adaptation in acute and chronic protozoan infection, with broader implications for infection and inflammation in general.">

        <tr id="Coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus within a host poses a unique challenge in understanding immunological dynamics, especially the role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in mediating the immune response. This work present a mathematical model to examine the dynamics of coinfection within a host, highlighting CTL-mediated immunity. Generally, this model encompasses several compartments, including epithelial cells, free viruses, and CTLs specific of both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A. The basic properties of the model, equilibrum state analysis, stability using the Lyapunov function, and numerical simulations are examined to investigate the dynamics behavior of the model. Eight equilibrium states are identified: the virus-free equilibrium (E0), single SARS-CoV-2 infection without CTLs (E1), single Influenza A virus infection without CTLs (E2), single SARS-CoV-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs (E3), single Influenza A virus infection with Influenza A virus-specific CTLs (E4), SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus coinfection with SARS-CoV-2-specific CTLs (E5), SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus coinfection with Influenza A virus-specific CTLs (E6), and SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus coinfection with both SARS-CoV-2-specific and Influenza A virus-specific CTLs (E7). The existence and stability regions for each equilibrium state are determined and represented in the R1-R2 plane as threshold functions within the model. Numerical simulations confirm the results of the qualitative analysis, demonstrating that CTLs specific to SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus can be activated, reducing the number of infected epithelial cells as well as inhibiting virus transmission within epithelial cells. Furthermore, analysis of parameter changes shows that increasing the proliferation rate of epithelial cells and CTLs, while lowering the virus formation rate, can shift the system's stability threshold and stabilize it at the virus-free equilibrium.">

However, the molecular mechanism for the increased mortality in cancer patients infected with COVID-19 is unclear. Methods Colony formation and wound healing assays were performed on Huh-7 cells cocultured with syncytia. Exosomes were purified from the cell supernatant and verified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western blot (WB) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Differentially expressed proteins in syncytia-derived exosomes (Syn-Exos) and their functions was analyzed by Proteomic sequencing. Syn-Exo-mediated promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was measured by CCK-8 and Transwell migration assays. The mechanism by which Syn-Exos promote tumor growth was analyzed by Western blotting. A patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) mouse model was constructed to evaluate the pathological role of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S). The number of syncytia in the tumor tissue sections was determined by immunofluorescence analysis. Results Syncytium formation promoted the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Proteomic sequencing revealed that proteins that regulate cell proliferation and metastasis in Syn-Exos were significantly upregulated. Syn-Exos promote the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Animal experiments showed that a pseudotyped lentivirus bearing SARS-2-S (SARS-2-Spp) promoted tumor development in PDX mice. More syncytia were found in tumor tissue from SARS-2-Spp mice than from VSV-Gpp mice. Conclusions Syn-Exos induced by SARS-2-S can promote the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.">

        <tr id="  COVID-19 disease is a clinical syndrome caused by an envelope RNA virus, called SARS-COV-2., which causes infection with wildly clinical pictures. Through COVID-19 infection several components of humoral and cellular immune response have an important role in the progression of the infection. Chemokines are one of the inflammatory mediators that play an essential role in the immune pathogenesis of COVID-19. It is secreted by respiratory virus-infected cells in the upper respiratory tract, causing stimulation and recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, NK, eosinophils, and macrophages from the bloodstream to the site of the infection. This study strives to determine the impact role of inflammatory mediator chemokine RANTES (CCL5) in COVID-19 Iraq patients. Blood samples collected from 180 individuals were enrolled in this study, 120 of them were patients infected with COVID-19 and verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients were categorized into two groups based on the severity of the disease, the severe group included 60 patients and the mild/moderate group included 60 patients also. Furthermore, 60 healthy individuals who were confirmed to be COVID-19-negative were enrolled in this study as a control group. The quantitative detection of CCL5 in human serum was done by the CCL5 Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay kit based on the principle of sandwich ELISA. This study showed that there were interesting highly significant differences (p<0.001) in the median serum level of CCL5 between all groups that participated in this study and there was a significant increase in the median level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate groups versus severe patients’ group (66.66 pg/ml, and 54.04 pg/ml vs. 38.41 pg/ml respectively). According to the results of this study, the low level of CCL5 associated with COVID-19 severity infection could be used as a predictor marker for severity while the elevated level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate suggested the elevated level of this chemokine is likely to be associated with the resolution of inflammation and recovery.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is characterized by a complex of interactions within viral factors, abnormal haemostasis, dysfunction of endothelial cells, and inflammatory reactions, necessitating the research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Severe COVID-19 conditions are frequently coupled with an increased immunological response, dubbed a cytokine storm, which facilitates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha). The cytokine storm contributes to widespread inflammation and endothelial activation, disrupting the balance between pro-coagulant and anticoagulant factors. Additionally, it is capable of being transmitted by contacting surfaces that are contaminated and then rubbing the face. Biomarkers such as D-dimer levels serve as valuable tools in risk assessment and monitoring, yet their interpretation requires careful consideration within the clinical context. Although some COVID-19 patients may not exhibit any symptoms, they can still spread the virus to others, and there is proof that the virus can spread via the air in some environments, especially confined areas with inadequate ventilation. Vaccines have been developed and deployed globally to prevent COVID-19 infection and reduce severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Governments and health authorities worldwide have implemented policies including lockdowns, social isolation, mask-wearing, investigation, contact tracking, and vaccination campaigns to control transmission and reduce the impact of the virus. Data were sorted from PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer, Nature, Tailor and Francis, MDPI, BMC and some other related data. This review provides appreciable information on the pathophysiology, management and therapeutic challenges of coagulopathy in Covid-19 patients.">

As a highly successful pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved numerous strategies to evade host immune responses, making it essential to understand the interactions between Mtb and host cells. G-protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, contributes to the regulation of pro-inflammatory reactions and the migration of innate immune cells, such as macrophages. Its role in mycobacterial infection, however, has not yet been explored. We found that GPR84 is induced in whole blood samples from tuberculosis patients and Mycobacterium marinum (Mm)-infected macrophage models. Using a Mm-wasabi infection model in mouse tails, we found that GPR84 is an important determinant of the extent of tissue damage. Furthermore, from our studies in an in vitro macrophage Mm infection model, it appears that GPR84 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and increases intracellular lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, thereby promoting intracellular bacterial survival. Our findings suggest that GPR84 could be a potential therapeutic target for host-directed anti-TB therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) is a human pathogen that causes local and systemic infections of the skin and mucous membranes. However, GAS is also found asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of infants. GAS infections, including pharyngitis and invasive pneumosepsis, pose significant public health concerns. Streptokinase, a key virulence factor of GAS, activates human plasminogen, facilitating bacterial dissemination. Plasminogen, traditionally known for its role in fibrinolysis, may also modulate host immune responses. We therefore aim to investigate systemic and cardiac immune cell responses during pneumonia and pneumosepsis with GAS in a murine infection model. The interaction of streptokinase with human plasminogen is species-specific, therefore the murine pneumosepsis model was developed in a transgenic mouse strain that produces human plasminogen. The data show a critical role of human plasminogen for GAS colonization and systemic spread via the nasopharynx. Due to pneumosepsis blood immune cell profiles and plasma protein levels significantly alters, indicating potential biomarkers for distinguishing local from systemic infection. In the hearts of animals with invasive infection proinflammatory immune cells significantly increased and likely displaced resident healing macrophages. The established pneumosepsis model is useful to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying local and invasive pneumonia caused by GAS and to investigate new therapeutic options.">

We identified several ZIKV proteins, notably envelope (E), NS2A, NS3, and NS4B, that contribute to this downregulation. Notably, treatment with lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl or the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) mitigated the AXL/TIM-1 downregulation, indicating autophagy’s involvement in the process. Importantly, this downregulation facilitates sustained viral replication and promotes viral spread by preventing superinfection and limiting cell death, which is also associated with impaired innate immune signaling. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which ZIKV downregulates entry factors to enhance prolonged viral replication and spread. AUTHOR SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with severe birth defects, yet the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors AXL and TIM-1 and discovered that they promote ZIKV entry but are downregulated by the virus infection. We identified several ZIKV proteins involved in AXL and TIM-1 down-regulation through an autophagy-mediated process. Mechanistically, this loss of surface receptors protects host cells from superinfection and cell death, while dampening the innate immune response, ultimately promoting viral spread. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ZIKV’s interactions with host cells and offer insight into viral entry, innate signaling, and pathogenesis.">

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to significant global morbidity and mortality. While many patients recover, a subset experiences persistent pulmonary complications, including post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF), a condition characterized by irreversible lung scarring and impaired gas exchange. Several risk factors, such as advanced age, male sex, pre-existing lung disease, and severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, contribute to its development. Radiological assessments, particularly high-resolution computed tomography, reveal hallmark features such as reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and parenchymal bands, aiding in diagnosis. Current therapeutic strategies include corticosteroids, antifibrotic agents (pirfenidone, Nintedanib), and immunosuppressants, though no standardized treatment exists. Pulmonary rehabilitation and supplemental oxygen therapy offer symptomatic relief and improved functional outcomes. Future research explores novel agents, including buloxibutid, saracatinib, sirolimus, and resveratrol, as potential antifibrotic therapies. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and evolving treatment strategies for PCPF, emphasizing the need for continued research to optimize patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="HERVs (Human endogenous retroviruses) are remnants of ancient exogenous retroviruses that have integrated into the human genome, particularly in germ-line cells. Among these, the envelope protein gene HERV-W env (Human endogenous retroviruses W family envelope protein), located on chromosome 7 and primarily expressed in the human placenta, has been closely linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as autoimmune diseases and cancer. Recent studies have highlighted the abnormal expression of cytokines as a key factor in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Notably, elevated serum levels of IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta) in schizophrenia, a cytokine associated with inflammation, are a characteristic feature of pyroptosis—a form of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death. Although previous research has observed significant upregulation of pyroptosis-related genes such as CASP1 (Caspase-1), NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), and IL1B (interleukin 1 beta) in the serum of schizophrenia patients, and extensive neuron pyroptosis has been documented in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis, the occurrence of neuron pyroptosis in schizophrenia remains uncertain. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying pyroptosis in schizophrenia and its potential connection with HERV-W env have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that the expression levels of pyroptosis-related genes, specifically CASP1, GSDMD (Gasdermin D), and IL1B, were significantly elevated in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between HERV-W env expression and the levels of CASP1/GSDMD/IL1B in these patients. Experimental evidence further demonstrated that HERV-W env promoted the activation of Caspase-1 and the cleavage of Gasdermin D, leading to increased release of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and IL-1β. Importantly, inhibitors targeting NLRP3, CASP1, and GSDMD significantly reduced the releases of LDH and IL-1β induced by HERV-W env, whereas BID (BH3 interacting domain death agonist) inhibitors did not have a notable effect. This suggests that HERV-W env induces CASP1–GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis through the NLRP3–CASP1–GSDMD signaling pathway. As pyroptosis is increasingly recognized for its connection to neurodegenerative diseases, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal pyroptosis mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome in the context of HERV-W env. Additionally, it explores the potential facilitation of HERV-W env in the development of schizophrenia via pyroptosis, proposing that certain pyroptosis indicators could serve as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. Based on our existing research results and the findings of previous researchers, we infer that HERV-W env acts as a bridge in the onset and progression of schizophrenia. Furthermore, HERV-W env may serve as a potential target for the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, suggesting that monoclonal antibody therapy targeting HERV-W env could represent a novel approach to managing this disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lyme arthritis (LA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, with approximately 10-20% of patients developing antibiotic resistance. Macrophages in the synovial microenvironment play a crucial role in disease progression, but their precise regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Methods scRNA-seq data of synovial tissue from LA patients was obtained from the GEO database (GSE233850) and integrated with transcriptome data from our research team’s LA mouse model and the GSE125503 dataset. Multiple analytical strategies, including cell clustering, differential gene analysis, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, pseudotime trajectory analysis, and cell-cell communication analysis, were employed to systematically investigate macrophage characteristics in LA. In vitro experiments using RAW cell lines were conducted to validate the role of key genes in response to Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Results Through single-cell transcriptome analysis of 78,015 cells in the GSE233850 dataset, we identified and annotated 27,843 macrophages, further classifying them into 4 functional subgroups. Differential expression analysis revealed 387 macrophage-specific genes. Cell-cell communication network analysis showed that macrophages interact with other immune cells, including T cells and B cells, through multiple signaling pathways. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in biological processes such as inflammatory response regulation, pathogen recognition, and cytokine signaling. By integrating transcriptome data from our team’s LA mouse model and the GSE125503 dataset, we screened and validated three potential diagnostic marker genes (SIRPB1C, FABP5, and PEPD). In vitro experiments using the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line showed significant expression changes in these genes following Borrelia burgdorferi stimulation (P < 0.05). Conclusion This study provides the first systematic characterization of macrophage transcriptome in the LA synovial microenvironment, revealing their functional heterogeneity and identifying potential diagnostic markers, offering new targets for targeted therapeutic strategies.">

Unlike other well‐studied viruses, research on mpox is limited, particularly regarding its impact on cellular processes. In this article, we explore how mpox might manipulate metabolic pathways—such as glycolysis, lipid synthesis and mitochondrial dynamics—to enhance its replication and evade immune responses. By drawing parallels with related poxviruses, we underscore the potential for targeting these metabolic shifts as novel therapeutic strategies. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments against mpox.">

Although SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 has been responsible for pneumonia,
recent studies indicate that it also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain, among other vital organs.
Evidence suggests that this virus may travel retrogradely from the olfactory epithelium to brain
stem sections, causing neurological impairments in a significant number of individuals. Individuals
with severe COVID-19 frequently have elevated cytokines that promote inflammation and acute
respiratory failure and require frequent supportive ventilation. These factors are believed to contribute
to cognitive deterioration. Severe neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients include- paralysis,
stroke, cranial nerve deficits, delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, and meningitis. The virus, with
its unique structure, and a high binding affinity for the human enzyme ACE2 (used as an entry point
by the virus), contributes significantly to its deadly nature. Furthermore, to address the outbreak effectively,
researchers worldwide must develop precise treatment strategies. Advancing new diagnostic
and treatment methods to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on cognition requires further
epidemiological research and clinical experience. Additionally, by understanding the virus's
impact on cognitive functions, healthcare professionals can develop targeted treatments to alleviate
these severe neurological consequences.

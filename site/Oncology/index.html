        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is a heterogeneous clinical condition of uncertain etiology triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we used ultrasensitive approaches to profile the immune system and the plasma proteome in healthy convalescent individuals and individuals with long COVID, spanning geographically independent cohorts from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Symptomatic disease was not consistently associated with quantitative differences in immune cell lineage composition or antiviral T cell immunity. Healthy convalescent individuals nonetheless exhibited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than individuals with long COVID, and extensive phenotypic analyses revealed a subtle increase in the expression of some co-inhibitory receptors, most notably PD-1 and TIM-3, among SARS-CoV-2 nonspike-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with long COVID. We further identified a shared plasma biomarker signature of disease linking breathlessness with apoptotic inflammatory networks centered on various proteins, including CCL3, CD40, IKBKG, IL-18 and IRAK1, and dysregulated pathways associated with cell cycle progression, lung injury and platelet activation, which could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was repurposed to treat COVID-19 based on its in vitro antiviral effects. However, it was abandoned after multiple clinical trials reported a lack of efficacy. Immunomodulatory effects have been proposed but remain unclear, yet they may be relevant given IVM use for other infections. We assessed the IVM immunomodulatory effect in 24 participants from a clinical trial evaluating its potential to reduce COVID-19 transmission in mild cases within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM-treated patients showed non-significant lower viral loads, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We measured IgG, IgA, and IgM against five SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and 30 cytokines by Luminex, alongside whole blood RNA sequencing, pan-leukocyte immunophenotyping, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell analysis by flow cytometry from day 1 to day 28 post-treatment. All antibody responses increased from day 4, while 13 cytokines significantly decreased over time (adjusted p<0.05). IVM-treated patients had only significantly higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels at day 4 (adjusted p=0.041) and 7 (adjusted p=0.045) compared to placebo. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased over time, with significantly higher effector memory CD4+ T cells at day 7 compared to day 1 (p=0.027) and the only difference between groups was lower frequencies of spike-specific naïve CD4+ T cells at day 7 in IVM-treated participants (0.006% vs 0.036% p=0.02). Transcriptomic data showed downregulation of innate and antiviral blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) over time, with an increase in adaptive immune related BTMs. While no differential gene expression was detected, the IVM-treated had upregulated innate and downregulated T cell and cell cycle BTMs compared to placebo. Overall, our comprehensive longitudinal analysis of early immune responses in mild COVID-19 revealed no robust immunological effects of IVM, consistent with clinical trials results and suggesting a lack of efficacy of IVM in COVID-19 treatment. AUTHOR SUMMARY Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was tested in clinical trials as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due to its in vitro antiviral properties and hypothetical immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory effects of IVM in a clinical trial involving 24 mild COVID-19 patients who received IVM within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM group showed a trend towards lower viral loads post-treatment, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We comprehensively analyzed immune responses by measuring antibody levels, cytokine profiles, immune cell subsets and whole blood gene expression over 28 days. The IVM group only had increased levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid compared to the control group. IVM did not affect the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 T cells, despite a slight decrease in naive CD4+ T cells. Additionally, gene expression analysis showed a decrease in innate and antiviral responses and an increase of adaptive responses over time that were slightly stronger in the placebo compared to the IVM group. In conclusion, despite some differences in IVM treated participants, our detailed analyses do not support significant immunomodulatory effects that could benefit disease progression.">

        <tr id="Background : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a public health challenge worldwide. The gastrointestinal tract has emerged as an important site of infection and has been implicated as a reservoir for long-term infection, particularly for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, whether vaccine-induced systemic antibodies can prevent intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Compared to Vero cells commonly used to assess SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the intestinal epithelium has a functional interferon response and expresses higher levels of ACE2, enzymes, and antibody-binding Fc receptors that may impact SARS-CoV-2 immune elimination. Methods : We evaluated the potential of antibodies from both naturally infected and vaccinated human subjects to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium. Serum samples were collected from human volunteers who had undergone natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 (n=5) or who had received the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (n=13). Banked sera collected in 2016 served as negative controls (n=2). SARS-CoV-2 (WA01, Delta or Omicron) was pre-treated with sera and then used to infect iPSC-derived human intestinal organoids (HIO) or Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by plaque assay, PCR, or immunofluorescence (IF) after 48-96 h. Results: Both HIOs and Caco-2 cells supported robust infection with SARS-CoV-2. In HIOs, pretreatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a high titer post-vaccine serum completely blocked replication of WA01. Similarly, sera from both naturally infected donors collected in 2020 and sera from individuals who had received a BNT162b2 vaccine significantly inhibited replication of the WA01 strain in Caco-2 cells. In contrast, none of the sera significantly inhibited infection with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. For Omicron, only sera from individuals who had received an Omicron-based vaccine significantly inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the plaque assay. Across all virus types, sera from individuals who had received Omicron-based BNT162b2 boosters were the most effective at reducing infection in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that vaccine-induced antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective in the gut. Our study also supports previous reports indicating that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines need to be adapted to circulating virus strains to convey full protection from infection.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

        <tr id="Viral encephalitis, resulting from neurotropic viral infections, leads to severe neurological impairment, inflammation, and exhibits high mortality rates with poor prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of effective targeted treatments for this disease, which poses a significant public health concern. SARM1 has been identified as the pivotal mediator of axonal degeneration and inflammation across various neuropathies, activated by an elevation in the NMN/NAD+ ratio. However, comprehensive in vivo investigations into the role of SARM1-mediated pathogenesis in viral encephalitis are still lacking. In this study, we established mouse models of viral encephalitis using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and rabies virus (RABV) as representative pathogens. Our findings demonstrate that neurotropic virus infections elicit robust axonal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and profound neuropathological damage in cortical neurons via the activation of SARM1. In mouse models of viral encephalitis, deletion or inhibition of SARM1 effectively preserved axonal morphology and maintained mitochondrial homeostasis, while also attenuating the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes in the cortex. Consequently, these interventions ameliorated neuropathological damage and enhanced survival outcomes in mice. Our findings suggest that SARM1-mediated axonal degeneration and brain inflammation exacerbate the pathological progression of viral encephalitis. Therapies targeting SARM1 emerge as viable and promising strategies for protecting neuronal function in the context of neurotropic viral infections.

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Age is among the strongest risk factors for severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we describe upper respiratory tract (URT) and peripheral blood transcriptomes of 202 participants (age range of 1 week to 83 years), including 137 non-hospitalized individuals with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and 65 healthy individuals. Among healthy children and adolescents, younger age is associated with higher URT expression of innate and adaptive immune pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces broad upregulation of URT innate and adaptive immune responses among children and adolescents. Peripheral blood responses among SARS-CoV-2-infected children and adolescents are dominated by interferon pathways, while upregulation of myeloid activation, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways is observed only in adults. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, fever is associated with blunted URT immune responses and more pronounced systemic immune activation. These findings demonstrate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 differ across the lifespan, from distinct signatures in childhood and adolescence to age-associated alterations in adults.">

        <tr id="With the continuous emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, long-lasting and broadly reactive cellular and humoral immunity is critical for durable protection from COVID-19. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants. These findings suggest a functional role of CoV-cross-reactive T cells that extends beyond the initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, contributing to enhanced immunity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can cause neurological symptoms, but the underlying neurotropic mechanisms are unclear. Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics. In summary, human astrocytes, but not neurons, contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, highlighting the potential benefits of ketamine treatment in coronavirus infections.">

        <tr id="In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion2 and systemic hyperinflammation3. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities, making the advanced age as a major predictor of disease severity. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms explaining how old age represents a major risk factor remain elusive. To investigate this, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15–22 months) mice. Both groups of K18-ACE2 mice were intranasally infected with 500 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with analyses performed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infection (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, lung RNA-seq, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable differences, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance, reduced survival, and failure to recover weight loss due to infection. RNA-seq data suggested greater lung damage and reduced respiratory function in infected aged mice. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient antiviral response characterized by reduced Th1-associated mediators (IFNγ, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9) and diminished number of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. These findings indicate that aging affects antiviral immunity, leading to prolonged infection, greater lung damage, and poorer clinical outcomes. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="Viral replication in endothelial cells is a hallmark of many viral diseases in humans and other animals, underscoring the importance of understanding cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication and the associated consequences for vascular health. Pathogenic variants of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV, Isavirus salaris) target endothelial cells of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), causing severe systemic disease and major losses during outbreaks in aquaculture. To better understand the endothelial response to ISAV, we used single nucleus RNA-sequencing at pre-clinical (12 days post infection, dpi) and clinical (16 dpi) stages of infection. Our approach enables an assessment of transcriptomic responses for different endothelial subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. ISAV RNA was predominantly detected in endothelial cells, which, along with mononuclear phagocytes, showed the highest number of differentially regulated genes at both time points. At 12 dpi, differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells were enriched for pathways related to NOD-like receptor signaling, antiviral responses, and regulation of programmed cell death. By 16 dpi, we observed a shift toward enrichment of pathways associated with cellular senescence, apelin signaling, and insulin signaling. We identified two distinct infection-related states at both time points: a virus-permissive state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, small GTPase signaling, and MAPK activity, and a bystander phenotype marked by activation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and translational regulation.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The spike S1 subunit induces inflammatory cytokine production, but the immune cell subsets that respond to S1 stimulation and contribute to disease severity remain unclear. Methods We analyzed serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 (moderate: n = 7; severe: n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 38). Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement. The frequency of CD147hi cMono showed a stronger positive correlation with clinical severity markers in younger patients compared to older patients. Conclusions CD147hi cMono are the primary cellular source of S1-induced inflammatory cytokines and may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity and treatment response.

        <tr id="Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis, with a fatality rate of 20-50% in treated individuals. Although corticosteroid therapy can increase survival in HIV-negative people with TBM, better antimicrobial and host-directed therapies are required to improve outcome. There is, therefore, a need to better understand local immunopathologic pathways. Despite its power in identifying disease-specific cellular profiles, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been underutilized in cerebral samples in brain infection. We employed scRNA-seq to analyze fresh pretreatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from four TBM patients, along with paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). While 29 cell subtypes were present in both tissues, their relative abundance varied significantly. In particular, CSF was enriched with highly inflammatory microglia-like macrophages, GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells, and CD56bright NK cells. The latter two subsets exhibited features associated with dysfunctional cytotoxicity. Across multiple cell types, inflammatory signaling pathways were increased and oxidative phosphorylation was decreased in CSF compared to PBMCs. This study highlights the value of scRNA-seq for exploring CSF immunopathogenesis in TBM patients and offers a resource for future studies investigating the pathophysiology of TBM and other brain infections, including potentially targetable cell populations linked with immune-mediated pathology.">

Evidence suggests that T1D is a heterogenous disease, where the type of antibodies first formed imply subtypes. Here, we followed 49 children, who subsequently presented with T1D and 49 matched controls, profiling single-cell epigenomics at different time points of disease development. Quantitation of cell and nuclei populations as well as transcriptome and open-chromatin states indicated robust, early, replicable monocyte lineage differences between cases and controls, suggesting heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion early among cases. The order of autoantibody emergence in cases showed variation across lymphoid and myeloid cells, potentially indicating cellular immune response divergence. The strong monocytic lineage representation in peripheral blood immune cells before seroconversion and the weaker differential coordination of these gene networks close to clinical diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early life as a critical phase in T1D development.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including prolonged viral shedding and emergence of mutations. To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different cell-type specific reprogramming as a result of B cell depletion treatment in MS.">

        <tr id="Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a principal environmental risk factor contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and can be causally linked to ASD symptoms. In our study, we found that MIA triggered by poly (I: C) injection caused ventriculomegaly in offspring due to the dysfunction of the choroid plexus (Chp) and ependyma. We subsequently identified a sustained enhancement of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling in the brain and serum of MIA offspring. Further study revealed that increased IFN-γ signaling could disrupt the barrier function of Chp epithelial cells by activating macrophages, and suppress the differentiation of primary ependymal cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 signaling. The effects of MIA on the offspring were mitigated by administration of IFNGR-blocking antibody in pregnant dams, while systemic maternal administration of IFN-γ was sufficient to mimic the effect of MIA. Overall, our findings revealed that ventriculomegaly caused by IFN-γ signaling could be a critical factor in compromising fetal brain development in MIA-induced ASD and provide a mechanistic framework for the association between maternal inflammation and abnormal development of ventricles in the offspring.

        <tr id="The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly heterogeneous, with interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression playing a dual role in antiviral defense and immune dysregulation. To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that prevent immune cell infiltration into the brain have demonstrated efficacy in multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment. However, their unpredictable adverse effects necessitate the development of safer therapeutic alternatives. The choroid plexus (ChP) functions as a crucial barrier against immune cell invasion, and previous studies have shown that preventing immune cell infiltration across the ChP reduces brain lesion in MS animal models. Understanding ChP barrier regulation is therefore essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets for MS. Here, we explored the role of Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods We examined the expression patterns of SPAK signaling in ChP using immunofluorescence in the EAE model. To investigate the roles of SPAK, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9 in EAE pathology, we performed ChP-specific gene manipulation via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/5 (rAAV2/5). T cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) was analyzed using CD4 immunostaining and flow cytometry. We employed cell immunofluorescence, transwell assays, and rescue experiments in vitro to study SPAK’s effects on ChP epithelial barrier integrity. We also evaluated the protective effects of SPAK-Na-K-2Cl cotransporter-1 (NKCC1) inhibitors (ZT-1a and bumetanide) on immune invasion and demyelination during EAE using pharmacological approaches. Results Following EAE induction, we observed progressive increases in both total and phosphorylated SPAK levels in ChP epithelium. Notably, ChP-specific SPAK knockdown significantly reduced T cell invasion and ameliorated EAE pathology, while SPAK overexpression exacerbated these effects. Bulk RNA sequencing and subsequent qPCR validation revealed that SPAK knockdown decreased the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, MMPs that compromise barrier integrity by degrading tight junction proteins. In vitro studies demonstrated that SPAK overexpression impaired ChP barrier function through the activator protein-1 (AP-1)-MMP2/9-zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) axis. Furthermore, ChP-specific knockdown of either MMP2 or MMP9 protected against EAE pathology. Additionally, we identified SPAK-NKCC1 antagonists (bumetanide and ZT-1a) as promising therapeutic candidates for MS/EAE treatment. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that targeting ChP-SPAK signaling represents a novel therapeutic strategy for MS treatment.

        <tr id="The understanding of how the host immune response differs in T-cell phenotype and memory formation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) remains limited. LTRs who recovered from COVID-19 infection without prior vaccination represent a unique population for studying immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Six LTRs with positive neutralizing antibodies (nAb+) and six LTRs with negative nAb (nAb-) were included at 6 months following COVID-19 infection. It was found that nAb+ LTRs had higher anti-RBD IgG titers and greater neutralizing percent inhibition compared to nAb- LTRs. Fifteen T-cell subsets were identified in COVID-19 convalescent LTRs, and it was shown that only terminal effector CD8+ - 3 decreased in the nAb+ group, while elevated IL-10 expression levels were found in the nAb- group. After stimulation with the SARS-CoV-2 XBB spike peptide pool in vitro, it was observed that the nAb+ group exhibited an increase in effector memory CD4+ cells with lower PD-1 expression, a reduction in effector memory CD4+ - 2 cells, and terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells, while the nAb- group showed high expression of CTLA-4 and IL-10 in terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells. Four SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell subsets were identified, with high expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in terminal effector CD8+ - 1 and terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in both groups. Perforin was mainly detected in terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in nAb+ LTRs. In addition to these proportional differences, stem cell memory CD4+ cells with higher IL-17A expression and stem cell memory CD8+ cells with higher CTLA-4 expression were also found in nAb- LTRs. These findings suggest that LTRs who developed nAb+ following SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit stronger T-cell responses, with more robust immune activation and memory recall, compared to nAb- LTRs. This study underscores the importance of understanding T-cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 recovery for guiding vaccination strategies and managing immunity in LTRs.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID-19 vaccines are crucial in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and severe health outcomes. Despite widespread administration, their long-term systemic effects on human metabolism remain inadequately understood. This longitudinal study aims to evaluate IgG responses, 34 cytokines, 112 lipoproteins, and 21 low-molecular-weight metabolites in 33 individuals receiving two to four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Changes in metabolic profiles for the first 16 days post each dose of vaccine, and up to 480 days post-initial dose, were compared to baseline (before vaccination). Additionally, metabolic profiles of vaccinated participants were compared to a reference cohort of unvaccinated individuals without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (controls) and SARS-CoV-2 cases. Positive IgG responses were observed in 78.8% (N = 26) of participants after the first dose, reaching 100% with subsequent doses. The most common side effects were localized pain at the injection site and “flu-like” symptoms, reported by > 50% of participants. Systemic side effects, e.g., sore lymph nodes, fatigue, and brain fog, were reported but showed no significant correlations to IgG responses. Transient temporal changes were observed for cytokine IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third vaccine dose. Compared to the reference cohort, 497 vaccinated samples (95.0%) had profiles similar to the controls, while the remaining 26 samples with prior infection exposures were similar to mild cases of SARS-CooV-2 infection. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination did not induce lasting changes in inflammatory and metabolic responses, nor did it induce changes similar to mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This supports the metabolic safety of the vaccine and contributes to increased vaccine confidence. Key messages Minimal changes in inflammatory/metabolic markers up to 480 days post-vaccination. Transient increase in IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third dose. Post-vaccination IgG response did not alter metabolic profiles like SARS-CoV-2 cases. Our findings provide insights into the safety of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations.

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and resulting coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) cause placental dysfunction, which increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. While abnormal placental pathology resulting from COVID‐19 is common, direct infection of the placenta is rare. This suggests that pathophysiology associated with maternal COVID‐19, rather than direct placental infection, is responsible for placental dysfunction. We hypothesized that maternal circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), altered by COVID‐19 during pregnancy, contribute to placental dysfunction. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized circulating EVs from pregnancies complicated by COVID‐19 and tested their effects on trophoblast cell physiology in vitro. Trophoblast exposure to EVs isolated from patients with an active infection (AI), but not controls, altered key trophoblast functions including hormone production and invasion. Thus, circulating EVs from participants with an AI, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, can disrupt vital trophoblast functions. EV cargo differed between participants with COVID‐19, depending on the gestational timing of infection, and Controls, which may contribute to the disruption of the placental transcriptome and morphology. Our findings show that COVID‐19 can have effects throughout pregnancy on circulating EVs, and circulating EVs are likely to participate in placental dysfunction induced by COVID‐19.">

The immune system plays an important role in establishing and maintaining successful pregnancy, yet deep understanding of immunological responses in pregnancy is lacking. To provide in-depth understanding of the immunological landscape of pregnancy, with a focus on NK cells, we used high-throughput cell surface proteome screening of >350 markers and scRNAseq with 130 CITE-seq antibodies to identify key differentially expressed molecules and investigated their potential roles in altered immunity. We identified skewing in NK cell subsets towards higher frequencies of CD56bright cells caused by a reduced number of CD56dim cells in the peripheral blood during pregnancy and provide evidence for a role of chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, in NK cell activation. In addition, we defined a new cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced decidual NK cell population in CMV+ pregnancies with tissue-residency markers. Overall, our data provide fundamental knowledge into how NK cell immunity is altered in pregnancy, and key knowledge needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic strategies to manage infections or pregnancy complications.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally; however, the characterization of molecular biomarkers of severe disease remains of great scientific importance. The aim of this study was to capture the transcriptional differences of the whole blood gene expression between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease, using Next Generation Sequencing technologies, on admission and after 7 days. The genes which were differentially expressed in severe compared to mild patients were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gene expression data were used to estimate the cell abundance of 22 immune cell types via digital cytometry. GO terms related to the response to molecules of bacterial origin, such as intestine-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were enriched, among other dysregulated pathways, which are well described as paramount mechanisms of severe manifestations of COVID-19. The neutrophil population increased in patients with severe disease, whereas the monocyte, CD8+ T cell, and activated Natural Killer (NK) cell populations were depleted. These cell population dynamics are also indicative of severe COVID-19 and intestinal bacterial translocation. This study elucidates the molecular basis of severe COVID-19 and highlights intestinal bacterial translocation as a potential driver of severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="Introduction Porcine Circovirus (PCV2) infection is prevalent in pig farming and causes significant economic losses. In recent years, the PCV2d subtype has become the most prevalent genotype worldwide, exhibiting higher virulence, leading to more severe viremia and organ damage. Therefore, studying the biological characteristics of the PCV2d subtype is of great significance. Methods We established a PCV2d infection model using BALB/c mice and employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically analyze the transcriptome of 10 cell types in the lung tissues of infected mice. We developed a comprehensive marker gene catalog for these cell types. Results Compared to uninfected mice, PCV2d infection induced extensive viral replication and immunosuppressive responses in most cell types. Monocyte macrophages with high levels of viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various cell population interactions occurring through CD40-CD40L and CXCL14-CXCR4 were identified. These cells predominantly mediate antigen presentation and processing pathways in vivo, contributing to PCV2d-driven inflammatory lung injury. Discussion Our data uncovered a complex unique immune response scenario in the lung tissue of mice after PCV2d infection, deciphering the potential mechanisms underlying PCV2d-driven inflammatory responses in mice. Furthermore, this study provides a rich database for the molecular basis of different cell types' responses to PCV2d infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely infectious respiratory virus and a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. MeV infection of the respiratory epithelium induces shedding of multinucleate epithelial cells from the apical surface of the epithelium without compromising epithelial barrier integrity. To study the mechanisms driving the apical extrusion of MeV-infected respiratory epithelial cells, we used primary differentiated tracheal epithelial cell cultures (rhTECs) and respiratory samples from rhesus macaques infected with wild-type MeV (WT MeV) or live-attenuated MeV (LAMV). We show that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, rather than cell death or inflammasome activation, plays a key role in WT MeV and LAMV-induced cell shedding. Inhibiting S1P signaling resulted in delayed shedding of clusters of infected cells and higher viral titers within the epithelium, suggesting that cell extrusion impacts viral dynamics within the respiratory tract. We also found that shedding of individual infected cells began early after apical infection, prior to the formation of infected cell clusters within the epithelium. These findings offer new insights into MeV biology and pathogenesis within the respiratory tract. IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, measles virus (MeV) still has a significant global impact, and in 2022 alone led to over 136,000 deaths. MeV is one of the most contagious known viruses and spreads via the respiratory route. When respiratory epithelial cells are infected, they are shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract, but this process is poorly understood. Here, we use primary differentiated respiratory epithelial cells from rhesus macaques to show that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, and not cell death or inflammasome activation, plays a role in cell shedding during both wild-type and live-attenuated MeV infection. Through this mechanism, MeV-infected cells are extruded without disrupting the integrity of the respiratory epithelium. Inhibiting S1P signaling resulted in delayed shedding of infected cells and higher viral titers in the epithelium. These findings indicate that host cellular responses play an important role in MeV infectivity.">

Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs9 expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon.COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC.

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life [1]. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells, and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV infected and bystander activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. Importance Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen.

        <tr id="Effective control of viral infection requires rapid induction of the innate immune response, especially the type I and type III interferon (IFN) systems. Despite the critical role of IFN induction in host defense, numerous studies have established that most cells fail to produce IFNs in response to viral stimuli. The specific factors that govern cellular heterogeneity in IFN induction potential during infection are not understood. To identify specific host factors that license some cells but not others to mount an IFN response to viral infection, we developed an approach for analyzing temporal scRNA-seq data of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. This approach identified the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) within pre-infection cells as correlates of IFN induction potential of those cells, post-infection. Validation experiments confirmed that intrinsic expression of the ISG OASL is essential for robust IFNL induction during IAV infection. Altogether, our findings reveal an important role for IFN-independent, intrinsic expression of ISGs in promoting IFN induction and provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell heterogeneity in innate immune activation.">

        <tr id="Background Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in immunocompromised individuals even in the presence of antiviral treatment provides opportunities for viruses to evolve in immune escape and drug-resistant variants. Case presentation A 72-year-old male with IgG4-related disease was admitted to the Emergency Department of a city Hospital in Milan and then transferred to Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in December 2023, due to respiratory distress due to SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed in November 2023. After 117 days since the onset of the infection, and two cycles of sotrovimab/remdesivir combined therapy, the clinical improvement allowed the hospital discharge, notwithstanding the persistent SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Fifteen days later, the patient was re-admitted to the hospital due to worsening clinical conditions. After a third cycle of sotrovimab/remdesivir combined therapy prolonged with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, nasopharyngeal load dropped and clinical conditions improved, ending with a successful discharge. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences, obtained at six time-points of infection, showed an FL.1.5.1 recombinant form infection and a genetic distance of median (IQR) 0.00052 (0.00041–0.00066) similar to the genetic distance observed among the 43 contemporaneous FL.1.5.1 recombinant forms (p = 0.098). De novo SNPs were observed at all time points, with a peak (n = 70) at day 133 of infection, corresponding to the time of the second hospitalization. Six non-synonymous mutations (three in the RdRp and three in the spike protein, four of them known to be associated with drug resistance) appeared transiently, after the third and fourth course of sotrovimab 500 mg/remdesivir combination. Five de novo SNPs, three of them in the spike protein, were fixed over the long-lasting infection. The spike N856K, associated with reduced fusogenicity and infectivity in Omicron BA.1, was completely replaced by constitutive N at day 136. Conclusions This clinical case confirms the intra-host evolution dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in an immunocompromised, prolonged-infected individual, involving positions associated with drug resistance and fusogenic traits of SARS-CoV-2. These results underscore the importance of the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised individuals, and its rapid containment using highly effective treatment, to limit serious complications and the risk of new and potentially concerning viral variants emergence.

        <tr id="Background The mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after non-severe COVID-19 remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells of patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and assess if distinct clinical subtypes with specific gene signatures could be identified. Methods The cohort included 111 PCC patients from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant era, with 57 recovered (Recov) and 54 having prolonged symptoms indicative of PCC. The results were compared to 63 healthy controls (Ctrl) without known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data included patient assessments, laboratory results, comorbidities, and questionnaires on quality of life and functioning. Transcriptomic analysis and cellular deconvolution methods were used on total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results PCC patients had more comorbidities (mean 1.3) and more frequently (59%) at least one comorbidity than recovered patients (31%) and controls (24%). Overall, past COVID-19 illness or current PCC symptoms caused minimal changes in the blood cell transcriptome, with only 3–6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across comparisons. However, a subset of male PCC patients exhibited an increased fraction of deconvoluted erythroblasts and significant genome-wide gene expression changes, with 399 DEGs compared to recovered and control males. These genes were enriched in pathways related to heme metabolism and gas exchange in erythrocytes. Conclusions Persistent symptoms in PCC are multifactorial and not directly linked to peripheral blood cell gene expression changes. However, a subgroup of male PCC patients shows distinct erythrocyte responses that may contribute to long-term symptoms.">

        <tr id="The fetal origins of neuropsychiatric disorders are poorly understood but have been linked to viral or inflammatory injury of the developing brain. The fetal white matter is particularly susceptible to injury as myelination, axonal growth, and deep white matter tracts become established. We have used the pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina) to study the maternal and fetal effects of influenza A virus (FLUAV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy, in cohorts with different time intervals between inoculation and delivery. We observed a striking histopathological alteration in a subset of astrocytes which contained granular cytoplasmic inclusions (“inclusion cells”, ICs) within a specific region of the deep cerebral white matter in the fetal brains from specific FLUAV and ZIKV cohorts. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics of ICs indicated that they are astrocytes (GFAP+) undergoing autophagocytosis (p62+) with activated lysosomes (LAMP1+, LAMP2+) and reactive changes in neighboring microglia. There was also a positive correlation between the number of ICs and LAMP1 or LAMP2 immunoreactivity in the fetal brain (LAMP1: rho 0.66; LAMP2: rho 0.54, p < 0.001 for both). Interestingly, ICs were significantly more prevalent in the 5-day FLUAV cohort and the 21-day intermediate ZIKV cohort than in controls (p < 0.005 and p = 0.04, respectively), but this relationship was not apparent in the ZIKV cohort with a shorter (2–3 days) or longer (months) time course. Virologic and immunologic assays indicated that the appearance of these cells was not linked with fetal brain infection. ICs were not observed in a macaque model of perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. These alterations in fetal white matter are pathologically abnormal and may represent a transient neuropathologic finding that signifies a subtle brain injury in the fetus after maternal viral infection.

        <tr id="Rationale: One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) may be a risk factor for the neuropathology linked to amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation. However, the mechanisms underlying HSV1-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in AD remain unclear. ALT001 is a novel drug that ameliorates AD-related cognitive impairment via ULK1/Rab9-mediated alternative mitophagy. In this study, we investigated the effects of ALT001 on the neurodegeneration-related microglial signatures associated with HSV1 infection. Methods: Molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of mitophagy was investigated in HSV1-infected microglia, including primary murine and human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived microglia (ES-MG), as well as in a microglia-neuron co-culture system. Microglial gene signatures following HSV1 infection in the presence or absence of ALT001 were analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing, and the effects of ALT001 on microglial phagocytosis and microglia-mediated immune responses were further evaluated by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles. Results: HSV1 infection inhibited PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy via HSV1-encoded protein kinase US3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction in both human and mouse microglia. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of HSV1-infected microglia revealed an upregulation of distinct microglial genes associated with disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like phenotype and pro-inflammatory activity. Pharmacological targeting of mitophagy using ALT001 prevents mitochondrial damage caused by HSV1 through ULK1/Rab9-mediated pathway. Furthermore, ALT001-induced ULK1/Rab9-dependent mitophagy restricts HSV1 infection by activating interferon-mediated antiviral immunity. Consequently, ALT001 reduces HSV1-triggered neuroinflammation, recovers HSV1-altered microglial phagocytosis for Aβ, and efficiently reverses morphological and molecular abnormalities in HSV1-infected microglia by triggering mitophagy in ES-MG. ALT001 also suppressed HSV1-mediated Aβ accumulation and neurodegeneration in the microglia-neuron co-culture and cerebral organoid model. Conclusions: In this study, we identified a critical molecular link between HSV1 and AD-related microglial dysfunction. Furthermore, our findings provide an evidence that therapeutic targeting of alternative mitophagy via ALT001 effectively interfere with HSV1-induced microglial dysfunction and alleviate neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome predominantly affecting children, with a propensity to induce coronary artery lesions. Aberrant immune activation and cytokines cascade reactions are involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in immune cell communication during the course of KD and to identify potential biomarkers. Methods The study enrolled seven pediatric patients diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease (KD) between December 2019 and December 2021. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was utilized to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Bioinformatics methods including quality control, dimensionality reduction, cell annotation, differential expression analysis, cell communication analysis, and co-expression network analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. Results This study utilized single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the dynamics of immune cell communication during the course of KD, revealing a significant increase in the number of CD14+ monocytes in the early stages of vasculitis, which play a central role in cell-cell communication. SELPLG was identified as a particularly crucial gene in the signal transduction among immune cells. The study also observed various cellular communication patterns of vasculitis at different time points and identified co-expression modules related to ribosomal function, cell proliferation, and immune responses in CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ monocytes. Notably, the expression of the ITK gene in CD14+ monocytes stood out. Furthermore, MHC-I genes were the most active molecules involved in signal transduction, and the expression of CD40 genes increased with the prolongation of vasculitis duration. Conclusion CD14+ monocytes play a pivotal role in cellular communication during the activation process of KD vasculitis, with SELPLG and ITK as important communication signal genes. These findings provide a novel perspective for the discovery of biomarkers, prediction of disease progression, and the development of targeted treatment strategies for KD.

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for immune evasion. While initial studies focused on the Wuhan variant and adaptive immunity, later emerging strains such as Omicron exhibit mutations that may alter their immune-modulatory properties. We performed a comprehensive review of immune evasion mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to focus on the evolutionary dynamics of immune modulation. We systematically analyzed and compared the impact of all currently known Wuhan and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 proteins on type I interferon (IFN) responses using a dual-luciferase reporter assay carrying an interferon-inducible promoter. Results revealed that Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp14, and ORF6 are potent type I IFN inhibitors conserved across Wuhan and Omicron strains. Notably, we identified strain-specific differences, with Nsp6 and Spike proteins exhibiting enhanced IFN suppression in Omicron, whereas the Envelope protein largely retained this function. To extend these findings, we investigated selected proteins in primary human endothelial cells and also observed strain-specific differences in immune response with higher type I IFN response in cells expressing the Wuhan strain variant, suggesting that Omicron’s adaptational mutations may contribute to a damped type I IFN response in the course of the pandemic’s trajectory.">

        <tr id="The upper airway epithelium is the primary site of exposure to Bordetella pertussis and the initiator of host responses to this microbe. B. pertussis may cause serious respiratory infections resulting in major complications, as well as severe impairment of airway function. While pertussis treatment options are limited because the molecular responses in the upper respiratory tract in the early stages of infection have not been characterized. Here, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of nasal turbinates isolated from mice over 11 days after B. pertussis infection. Using RNA-seq, we characterized the differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with the changes in the nasal turbinates following infection. Statistical analysis revealed that infection is a dynamic process characterized by increased expression of a set of acute inflammatory responses at an early stage. After this initial inflammatory response, we observed increases in the levels of transcripts associated with the regulation of immune processes. In particular, we found that B. pertussis infection significantly increased the levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and related genes in the nasal turbinates at 2 h, 2 days, and 4 days postinfection. Therefore, we investigated the role of type I IFNs in B. pertussis infection in type I IFNs receptor-deficient (IFNAR1−/−) mice. There was no difference in bacterial clearance or adaptive immune responses between wild-type and IFNAR1−/− mice. However, a lack of type I IFNs signaling ameliorated pulmonary immunopathology, reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and limited the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung during B. pertussis infection. Thus, our findings suggest that inhibiting the effects of type I IFNs may contribute to dampening inflammation, which could be an approach for the treatment of B. pertussis infection and management of the associated disease symptoms.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that invades lung epithelial cells and can lead to severe respiratory failure. In this study, we evaluated whether Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), a serum marker of lung alveolar cell damage, is predictive for disease severity. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Serum levels of Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), soluble Fas Ligand, cytochrome C, thymus- and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) and of oxidate stress related proteins were analyzed. Clinical patient data were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. COVID-19 positive patients were divided in two groups according to disease severity. The mean day difference between COVID-19 diagnosis date and sampling date was +11 days. Concentrations of TARC were lower in COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative patients (unpaired t-test, p=0.002). In addition, CC16 serum levels were significantly elevated in sera taken from patients that were admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) (p=0.0082). In a matched cohort, sera taken prior to ICU admission (-3 days) contained higher CC16 levels (paired t-test, p=0.0072). Multivariable analyses adjusted for known risk factors (age, gender, blood counts, lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, underlying disease) showed that CC16 levels were independently associated to COVID-19 severity (interquartile-range, odds ratio 1.53, p=0.0102). In conclusion, our findings highlight CC16 as a promising biomarker for early identification of severe COVID19 cases, which could improve patient management and resource allocation.">

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Bioaerosol-mediated transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via building ventilation systems has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. We used the South African Airborne Infections Research (AIR) facility near Pretoria to study human-to-animal (H2A) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in newly diagnosed patients. While the facility was built to study tuberculosis transmission, this was its first adaptation to study H2A virus transmission. Methods Patients with clinically confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 were housed for up to 4 days in in the AIR facility with continuously exhausting patient ward air to hamsters housed in animal exposure rooms. After a 3-week exposure period, animals were held for an additional week to allow for antibody development. Animal sera were analyzed for anti-spike and plaque reduction activities and lung samples for pathology. Results Seven patients provided ≥400 in-residence hours over a 17-day period. Pair-housed naive golden Syrian hamsters (n = 216) received continuous exposure to mixed patient ward exhaust. Serum analyses revealed anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in 58% of animals tested. Plaque reduction assays on 7 high-titer serum samples revealed neutralizing activity. Conclusions These results support the concept that viral bioaerosols generated from patients remain infectious over long-distance transport through a building ventilation system. The seroconversion among sentinel animals supports the long-held belief that airborne infections manifest as a stochastic rather than deterministic event that is subject to a threshold dose effect. Further confirmatory studies are necessary to characterize the relationship between the bioaerosol delivered and the infections that result in this controlled H2A transmission model.">

        <tr id="In this study, the critical role of the epipharynx in managing long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in particular, how residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA affects signalling pathways in the epipharynx were investigated via spatial gene expression analysis (Visium HD). Moreover, we hypothesize that epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) targeting the epipharynx could improve long COVID symptoms by modulating local inflammation and gene expression. We conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of three patients with long COVID and two control individuals without COVID-19. Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the epipharynx of patients with long COVID, along with the activation of signalling pathways in epithelial and immune cells. After EAT, the viral RNA was either completely cleared or significantly reduced. T-cell receptor signalling pathways were suppressed; the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, were reduced; and excessive antibody production was mitigated. Histology showed that EAT effectively eliminated the inflamed, dysfunctional ciliated epithelium. This study clarifies that SARS-CoV-2 has long-term effects on the immune response in the epipharynx, emphasizing the need to focus on chronic epipharyngitis as a potential cause of long COVID. Furthermore, EAT may offer a promising approach to alleviating persistent long COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 infection results in greater disease severity among immunocompromised individuals compared to healthy individuals. However, there is conflicting information about the impact of chronic HIV infection on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Method We used a combination of machine learning approaches and network analysis to explore 56 immune markers and comprehensively profile humoral and cellular immunity in a cross-sectional observational cohort of people without HIV (PWOH; n = 216) and people living with HIV (PLWH; n = 43) who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (13–131 days since SARS-COV-2 diagnosis) early in the pandemic. Results PLWH recovered from symptomatic outpatient COVID-19 exhibit lower humoral and B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vs. PWOH but, surprisingly, both symptomatic outpatient and hospitalized PLWH have higher anti-endemic coronavirus antibody responses compared to PWOH counterparts and asymptomatic PLWH. The latter observation suggests that this was not strictly due to broadly elevated levels of anti-endemic coronavirus antibodies in PLWH. Moreover, correlation-based analysis reveals that while different compartments of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are positively correlated in PWOH recovered from symptomatic outpatient COVID-19, these correlations are weaker in PLWH. Conclusion Our analyses reveal significant differences in the coordinated immune responses elicited by infection in PLWH compared to PWOH.">

Here we examine three mid-lactation Holsteins challenged with ~ 150 CFU of Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould) that developed chronic mastitis as assessed by bacteria and somatic cell counts in a single quarter. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of blood and milk cells identified immune cell populations of interest from both tissues, and the proportion of cell types recovered via scRNA-seq were highly similar to those recovered via flow cytometry. Granulocytes were the predominating cell type in both blood and milk samples; however granulocytes identified via scRNA-seq revealed several clusters comprised primarily of milk-derived cells. Milk-enriched granulocyte clusters were further investigated to identify gene signatures indicative of the granulocyte-specific localized immune responses in the mammary gland during chronic mastitis infection. Biological process enrichment analysis of gene signatures further revealed relevant networks such as granulocyte migration, myeloid cell differentiation, and inflammatory responses. In total, the work describes the immune landscape occurring at both peripheral and local sites of cattle with mastitis and identified important granulocyte-specific features of the localized immune response occurring during chronic infection.

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection leads to viral encephalitis and neurological damage in mice, causing significant neurological symptoms and brain damage. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms of PRV-induced encephalopathy and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We found that PRV infection increased the number of astrocytes and induced a phenotypic shift from the A2 to the A1 subtype, which was associated with increased secretion of MMP-9. MMP-9 was identified as a critical mediator of PRV-induced BBB disruption, as it degrades collagen VI, leading to BBB damage. PRV was shown to penetrate the BBB via a paracellular pathway, and MMP-9 deletion reversed this damage, mitigating tight junction injury. Additionally, PRV infection caused an “inflammatory storm” in the central nervous system (CNS), with increased levels of the chemokines CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCL-5; the cytokines IL-6 and IL-18; and TNF-α. The expression of INF-γ was significantly decreased. In conclusion, PRV infection disrupts the BBB and induces an inflammatory response in the CNS, with MMP-9 playing a key role in mediating BBB damage. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of PRV-induced encephalopathy and potential therapeutic targets for viral encephalitis.">

        <tr id="The implementation of COVID-19 policy and the rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the early pandemic significantly contained numerous outbreaks and reduced the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, the population immunity induced by existing vaccines was insufficient to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The host immunity induced by the wide spread of Omicron variants and its influence on emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are attracting broad attention. In this study, a clinical data analysis of the patients indicated that pre-vaccination reduced inflammatory responses and mitigated the severity of COVID-19 cases caused by natural infection with Omicron BA.5.2. The analysis of adaptive immune responses indicated that natural infection with BA.5.2 induced robust and broad immune responses, including both humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses (IFN-γ) against highly conserved viral antigens, and provided cross-reactive neutralization against various viral variants. Collectively, we report that the natural infection with Omicron BA.5.2 induced broad cross-reactive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, which suggests that the development of a live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with desired safety, high efficacy, broad spectrum, and long-term immune persistence is feasible. Therefore, we suggest that herd immunity, achieved through vaccination with attenuated vaccines, combined with booster doses of existing vaccines and antiviral therapy for people with high viral loads, may contribute to the eradication of this virus.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 results in mild to severe COVID‐19 disease courses. Several studies showed the association of impaired T‐cell responses and certain HLA haplotypes with disease severity. However, it remained unclear if T‐cell activation was compromised due to a general reduction of presented epitopes or other intrinsic factors within APCs or T cells. Furthermore, a potential reduction of presented epitopes would suggest if an upcoming SARS‐CoV‐2 variant could escape T‐cell immunity. Hence, knowledge about the T‐cell epitope landscape of SARS‐CoV‐2 would allow to better understand mechanisms leading to severe disease and to estimate the potential stability of the T‐cell response in light of virus evolution, which might provide insights for future vaccine designs. Hence, in the present study, the T‐cell epitope landscape of SARS‐CoV‐2 was determined via in vitro T‐cell stimulation plus in silico prediction. HLAs associated with mild and severe disease courses showed almost the same potential in epitope presentation, suggesting intrinsic factors of APCs or T cells as contributors to the more severe disease courses. As T‐cell epitopes did also not originate from regions of SARS‐CoV‐2 having shown high mutation rates in the past, a relatively stable T‐cell response can be expected regarding new SARS‐CoV‐2 strains in the future. Analysis of the T‐cell epitope landscape of SARS‐CoV‐2 suggests T‐cell intrinsic factors as likely modulators of disease severity and that the capacity of MHC‐peptide presentation remains stable among circulating SARS‐CoV‐2 viral strains.">

        <tr id="Understanding disease pathogenesis is essential to developing therapies in patients with infections that cause critical illness. Herein, we show that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels and markers of neutrophil activation are associated with disease severity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also provide a link between the adaptive and innate immune response by demonstrating an association between antibody levels and multiple markers of neutrophil degranulation and NETosis. We further demonstrate through a series of in vitro assays that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-antibody immune complexes can stimulate NETosis. Last, we discuss how this NETosis is more strongly associated with IgA immune complexes than IgG and can be ameliorated with spleen tyrosine kinase inhibition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Post-infection sequela of several viruses have been linked with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we investigated whether mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone or in combination with two putative Parkinsonian toxins, MPTP and paraquat, increased the susceptibility to develop Parkinsonian pathology. We also examined if G2019S LRRK2 mice had any change in sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 as well as if vaccination against this virus altered any neuropathology. Infection with WA-1/2020 or Omicron B1.1.529 strains sensitized both WT and G2019S LRRK2 mice to the neuropathological effects of a subtoxic exposure to MPTP, but not paraquat. These neuropathologies were rescued in WT mice vaccinated with mRNA- or protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice were only protected with the protein-based vaccine. These results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of Parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

        <tr id="Molecular changes underlying the persistent health effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. To discern the gene regulatory landscape in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, we performed enzymatic DNA methylome and single-cell RNA sequencing in nasal cells of COVID-19 patients (n = 19, scRNA-seq n = 14) and controls (n = 14, scRNA-seq n = 10). In addition, we resampled a subset of these patients for transcriptome analyses at 3 (n = 7) and 12 months (n = 5) post infection and followed the expression of differentially regulated genes over time. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 3112 differentially methylated regions between COVID-19 patients and controls. Hypomethylated regions affected immune regulatory genes, while hypermethylated regions were associated with genes governing ciliary function. These genes were not only downregulated in the acute phase of the disease but sustained repressed up to 12 months post infection in ciliated cells. Validation in an independent cohort collected 6 months post infection (n  = 15) indicated symptom-dependent transcriptional repression of ciliary genes. We therefore propose that hypermethylation observed in the acute phase may exert a long-term effect on gene expression, possibly contributing to post-acute COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections caused by rhinoviruses (RVs), influenza A virus (IAV) and endemic corona viruses (HCoV) result in a serious strain on healthcare systems and public health, underscoring an urgent need for inhaled broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. However, their development is challenging, as no standardized in vitro methodologies that can fully replicate the in vivo environment have been established. In this work, we aimed to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect of three 2-deoxylated glucose analogues (2-DGA): 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2-fluoro-2-dexoy-D-glucose and 2-fluoro-2-dexoy-D-mannose (2-FDM), by utilizing advanced in vitro air-liquid interface (ALI) airway models. We demonstrated that commonly used ALI models have variable susceptibility to RV, IAV and HCoV infection. Further, we showed that 2-DGA have an anti-inflammatory effect and suppress respiratory viral replication in models mimicking the upper and lower respiratory airways. Moreover, we confirmed that 2-DGA can be delivered via nebulization in vitro, highlighting their potential to be used as broad-spectrum inhaled antivirals. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating complex in vitro methodologies, such as primary cell ALI cultures and aerosol exposure, at an early stage of drug development.">

        <tr id="Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with ACE2, a key receptor within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis, regulating blood pressure, and modulating inflammation. An observational study analyzed the gene expression profiles of RAAS receptors and associated miRNAs in 88 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls, comparing the acute and post-acute phases to assess their impact on disease severity and recovery. Our findings revealed an association between reduced MAS1 expression in both advanced age (P = 0.03) and the need for oxygen supplementation (P = 0.04). Additionally, reduced ACE expression was associated with worse mortality outcomes (P = 0.01). Notably, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) in individuals requiring oxygen supplementation and in those with diabetes mellitus during both the acute and post-COVID-19 phases, further highlighting the impact of these conditions on RAAS. The miRNA analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-200c (P = 0.005), miR-let-7 (P = 0.01), and miR-122 (P = 0.03) in acute-phase COVID-19 patients. This dysregulation contributes to the inflammatory response and highlights the interaction between viral entry and immune regulation. These results underscore the significance of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MAS1 axis in inflammation regulation and suggest that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic potential. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and identifies the modulation of RAAS receptors and miRNAs as promising biomarkers for disease severity and potential therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Monkeypox virus (Mpox) has been recognized for causing distinct skin lesions and is primarily transmitted through skin and sexual contact. To date, the transmissibility and pathogenesis of the Mpox virus in distal human lung has never been completely explored. Here the transmission pathways and Mpox tropism on patient-derived air-liquid epithelium (ALE) model fabricated using isolated primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAECs) were investigated. hAECs were cultured and exposed to the Mpox virus clade IIb isolated from the patient. DNA, proteins, and the tropism were elucidated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and high-content fluorescent imaging. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to systematically observe the cellular distribution of viral particles. Viral titres were determined by TCID50 assay. Innate immune response and inflammatory mediators were measured using Milliplex® multiplex and ELISA analysis. Pathology at alveolar barrier integrity was determined using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) analysis. The study included mock-infected cells as control. Mpox virus significantly infected 42.82% of total hAEC populations. The prominent observed pathology included a significant reduction in TEER values, loss of tight junction protein, presence of tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), and syncytium morphology. Four stages of Mpox biogenesis were clearly observed without significant activation of IL-6, MIP1alpha, TNF-α, and Galectin-9, although IL-1β were subtly promoted. The developed patient-derived ALE is a versatile model for Mpox virus clade IIb infection reflecting respiratory transmission competence of the Mpox. Postinfection lung pathogenesis demonstrated alveolar barrier damage without significant inflammation, raising concerns about possible immune evasion by the virus.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG = anti-N IgG > anti-S1 IgG > anti-S1A IgG > anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM > anti-S1 IgM > anti-N IgM > anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65 years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has largely concluded, the varied trajectories it has followed in different regions of the world remain incompletely understood. Intensive research is needed to fully grasp its course and the implications for future global health challenges. Notably, the milder trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa has defied initial predictions. An emerging body of evidence suggests that, in addition to the continent’s younger average age and the lower prevalence of relevant comorbidities, co-infections with helminths may have also impressively shaped the pandemic’s milder trajectory in the region. Indeed, helminths are renowned for their ability to modulate human immune responses, which, while potentially beneficial in limiting excessive inflammation, could also diminish vaccine efficacy and impede viral clearance. This study investigated different aspects of the intricate interactions between COVID-19 and Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), a helminth infection caused by parasitic worms such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori and endemic to various regions in Sub-Saharan Africa and the tropics. Methods: For this purpose, samples of a larger and ongoing clinical trial (ethical approval codes: CHRPE/AP/525/17 and 325/21; trial registration number ISRCTN14042737) were collected from 222 individuals from endemic areas of Ghana, along with comprehensive clinical and demographic data. The samples include LF patients (n = 222) grouped according to their Lymphoedema (LE) stages, as well as COVID-19 vaccinated (n = 81) and non-vaccinated individuals (n = 141). All vaccinated participants received the COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1-S (also known as Vaxzevria) developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZenca. The expressions of SARS-CoV-2 and filarial-specific antibodies (IgG, IgA) were accessed using ELISA, while Luminex-based immunoassays were employed to measure the expression of SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific neutralizing antibodies. The interplay between vaccine responses and demographic factors was analyzed using group comparisons with the Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: The results indicate that a remarkable portion of unvaccinated individuals (56% IgA seropositive, 39% IgG seropositive) developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 despite no confirmed infection. Notably, the study identified a robust antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination, which was independent of the degree of LF pathology or parasitic status. An important observation was the reduced SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in individuals seropositive for Ascaris lumbricoides (p = 0.0264), highlighting an interaction between roundworm infection and COVID-19. Conclusions: The study concludes that the ChAdOx1-S COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca) triggers a strong immune response in LF patients; however, filarial and/or soil-transmitted helminth seropositivity might influence the COVID-19 infection-induced response. These findings emphasize the complexity of infectious disease dynamics in co-infected populations and the need to decipher parasite-induced immunomodulatory mechanisms on COVID-19 vaccination.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Processes related to how the intracranial microvasculature initiates brain‒peripheral crosstalk for subsequent blood‒brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction at an early stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) ictus are still unknown. This study elucidated the effect and potential mechanism of intracranial microvasculature-mediated T-cell infiltration on BBB function after SAH. Methods Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data related to SAH (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/omix; Accession No. OMIX006611) were retrieved and analyzed. The dataset was derived from the white matter region of adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 and 7 days after experimental SAH. The SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation, and experiments were subsequently conducted at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after SAH to evaluate T-cell infiltration, BBB integrity, neuronal injury, and neurological function. Results After SAH, CXCL12 expression was increased in endothelial cells and pericytes, promoting CD8+ T-cell infiltration via the CXCR4 pathway. This immune infiltration appeared to exacerbate BBB disruption and contribute to worsened neurological function. Blocking CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling with a CXCL12 neutralizing antibody or the CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100 significantly reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration, attenuated BBB damage and improved the neurobehavioral outcomes of SAH mice. Conclusion This study suggests that, following SAH, both pericytes and endothelial cells may contribute to immune regulation by producing CXCL12, which promotes CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration into the brain. This mechanism may play a role in BBB disruption and neurological dysfunction. Targeting the CXCL12–CXCR4 axis could offer a potential approach for mitigating immune-mediated injury after SAH.

        <tr id="Abstract Patients with hematologic diseases have experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a prolonged, progressive course. Here, we present clinical, pathological, and virological analyses of three cases of prolonged COVID-19 among patients undergoing treatment for B-cell lymphoma. These patients had all been treated with anti-CD20 antibody and bendamustine. Despite various antiviral treatments, high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) levels persisted for >4 weeks, and two of them succumbed to COVID-19. The autopsy showed bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrosis. Overlapping cytomegalovirus, fungal and/or bacterial infections were also confirmed. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed accumulation of mutations and changes in variant allele frequencies over time. NSP12 mutations V792I and M794I appeared independently in two cases as COVID-19 progressed. In vitro drug susceptibility analysis and an animal experiment using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that each mutation, V792 and M794I, was independently responsible for remdesivir resistance and attenuated pathogenicity. E340A, E340D, and F342INS mutations in the spike protein were found in one case, which may account for the sotrovimab resistance. Analysis of autopsy specimens indicated heterogeneous distribution of these mutations. In summary, we demonstrated temporal and spatial diversity in SARS-CoV-2 that evolved resistance to various antiviral agents in malignant lymphoma patients under immunodeficient conditions caused by certain types of immunochemotherapies. Strategies may be necessary to prevent the acquisition of drug resistance and improve outcomes, such as the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for lymphoma considering patients’ immune status and the institution of early intensive antiviral therapy.">

        <tr id="The outcome of the immune response depends on the content and magnitude of inflammatory mediators, the right time to start, and the duration of inflammatory responses. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent diverse disease severity. Understanding differences in immune responses in individuals with different disease severity levels can help elucidate disease mechanisms. Here, we serially analyzed the cytokine profiles of 809 patients with mild to critical COVID-19. The cytokine profile revealed an overall increase in IL-1β, IL-1Ra, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-18 and impaired production of IFN-α and -β. Only an early rise in IL-1Ra, IL-6, and IL-2 levels was linked to worse disease outcomes. On the other hand, long-term rises in IL-1β, IL-1Ra, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-18 levels were linked to worse disease outcomes. Principal component analysis identified a component, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-α, and IL-12, that was associated with disease severity. Spearman analysis revealed that the correlation of IL-1β and IFN-α was entirely different between mild and critical patients. Therefore, the ratio of IL-1β to IFN-α seemed to be a suitable criterion for distinguishing critical patients from mild ones. The higher levels of the IL-1β to IFN-α ratio correlated with improved outcomes. These data point to an imbalance of IL-1β/IFNα, contributing to hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the emergence of viral variants with distinct characteristics. Understanding the differential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for effective public health response and treatment development. We investigated the differential effects of the original Wuhan strain and the emergent Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 using a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between the variants, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality rates, severe lung pathology, and elevated viral loads compared to the Omicron variant. Microbiome analyses uncovered novel and distinct shifts in the lung and intestinal microbiota associated with each variant, providing evidence for variant-specific microbiome alterations. These changes suggest microbiome-related mechanisms that might modulate disease severity and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions This study highlights critical differences between the Wuhan strain and Omicron variant in terms of mortality, lung pathology, and microbiota changes, emphasizing the role of the microbiome in influencing disease outcomes. Novel findings include the identification of variant-specific microbiota shifts, which underscore potential microbiome-related mechanisms underlying differences in disease severity. These insights pave the way for future research exploring microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

        <tr id="Crohn’s disease (CD) involves a complex intestinal microenvironment driven by chronic inflammation. While single-cell RNA sequencing has provided valuable insights into this biology, the spatial context is lost during single-cell preparation of mucosal biopsies. To deepen our understanding of the distinct inflammatory signatures of CD and overcome the limitations of single-cell RNA sequencing, we combined spatial transcriptomics of frozen CD surgical tissue sections with single-cell transcriptomics of ileal CD mucosa. Coexpressed genes and cell-cell communication from single-cell analyses and factorized genes from spatial transcriptomics revealed overlapping pathways affected in inflamed CD, like antigen presentation, phagosome activity, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix. Within the pathways, early epithelial cells showed evidence of significant changes in gene expression and subtype composition, while spatial mapping revealed the location of the events, particularly antigen presentation from epithelial cells in the base of the crypt. Furthermore, we identified early epithelial cells as a potential mediator of the MHC class II pathway during inflammation, which we validated by spatial transcriptomics cell subtype deconvolution. Therefore, the inflammation from CD appears to change the types of interactions detectable between epithelial cells with immune and mesenchymal cells, likely promoting the conditions for more macrophage infiltration into these inflammatory microdomains.">

Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Introduction Syphilis is a complex disease with variable clinical presentation where symptomatic and potentially infectious stages alternate with periods of latency, representing a fascinating model to study immune evasion and host immune responses. Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC), bulk, and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin biopsies collected from subjects with secondary syphilis. Additionally, PBMCs from healthy individuals and either primary or MyD88 knock-out keratinocytes were exposed to live Treponema pallidum cells to define initial skin responses to the bacteria. Results Immunohistochemistry of secondary syphilis skin lesions showed a polymorphous immune infiltrate with colocalization of T cells, B cells and antigen–presenting cells. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct cellular contributions to the immune response, with prominent immune-stromal crosstalk accompanied by altered keratinocyte differentiation and decreased intraepidermal communication. Notably, prominent inflammatory signals were countered by concomitant regulatory responses, particularly in infiltrating myeloid cells. Exposure of PBMCs to live T. pallidum inhibited immune responses, while exposure to sonicated cells triggered CXCL1 and CXCL3 upregulation. Keratinocytes responded to both intact and sonicated T. pallidum with upregulation of type-I interferon responses that, however, were abolished in MYD88–deficient but not in STING–deficient keratinocytes. Discussion Our data provide novel insights into the contribution of epidermal TLR sensing through MYD88 to the host response to syphilis infection, highlighting mechanisms by which T. pallidum evades immune responses in skin that may facilitate transmission of this pathogen through the skin.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection. Methods Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11–14 days later. Results Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation. Discussion The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to COVID19 disease and caused a worldwide pandemic in 2019. Since the first wave of infections, there has been significant antigenic shifts, leading to the emergence of new variants. Today, infections have shifted away from the severe, fatal infection seen in 2019. Objective This study aimed to assess how the plasma metabolomes from patients varied with infection with different strains and could reflect disease severity. Methods Patients with COVID19 not requiring intensive care were recruited between January 2021 and May 2022 from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; 33 patients with alpha, 13 delta and 14 omicron variants. These were compared to 26 age matched contemporaneously recruited controls. Plasma samples were extracted into chloroform/methanol/water (1:2.5/1 v/v) and assessed by flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Derived data were assessed using the R based MetaboAnalyst platform. Results Plasma metabolomes from COVID19 patients were clearly different from controls. Metabolite variation could be related to infection with different SARS-CoV2 variants. Variant showed different levels of some phospholipids, ganglioside GD1a and a dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative. Correlations of the plasma metabolomes indicated negative correlations between selected phospholipids and the levels of C-reactive protein, creatinine, neutrophil and D-dimer. Conclusion The plasma metabolomes of COVID19 patients show changes, particularly in phospholipids, which could reflect disease severity and SARS-CoV2 variant infection.

        <tr id="Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop mild respiratory symptoms but also Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, severe systemic inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, followed by cleavage by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is known for its immune-modulating effects by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing regulatory T-cells. Furthermore, it has been tested in SARS-CoV-2-related clinical trials. We set out to investigate its role in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Epithelial cells (CaCo-2) were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, treated with native VIP and analyzed to investigate the mRNA and surface expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the enzyme activity of TMPRSS2 and the infection rate by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. VIP downregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and surface expression. Beyond these direct effects, VIP mediates the shedding of surface-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 via upregulation of a sheddase protease (ADAM10). Functionally, these dual mechanisms of VIP-mediated downregulation of proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry resulted in a reduced infection rate by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These data imply that VIP hampers viral entry mechanisms based on SARS-CoV-2 and the linkage to ADAM10 may stimulate research in other indications beyond SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 variants present diverse clinical manifestations, necessitating deeper insights into their pathogenic effects. This study employs multi-omics approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on vascular damage. Plasma proteomic analysis of unvaccinated participants infected with Omicron BA.2.76 or ancestral variants identifies key signaling pathways associated with endothelial dysfunction, with the vinculin (VCL) pathway emerging as a hallmark of Omicron infections, contributing to lung exudation. Metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from the same cohort reveals disruptions in immune function, cell membrane integrity, and metabolic processes, including altered tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis pathways. An integrated analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data underscores the role of VCL in inflammation and extravasation, highlighting its interactions with adhesion molecules and inflammatory metabolites. A validation cohort of plasma samples from Omicron-infected participants confirms this association by replicating proteomic analysis, showing elevated VCL levels correlated with inflammatory markers. Functional studies in a male rat model of lung injury demonstrate that anti-VCL intervention reduces plasma VCL levels, mitigates alveolar edema, and restores alveolar-capillary barrier integrity, as assessed by histological staining and electron microscopy, thereby illustrating VCL modulation’s impact on vascular leakage and extravasation. These findings establish VCL as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating vascular complications in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated a global pandemic resulting in an estimated 775 million infections with over 7 million deaths, it has become evident that COVID-19 is not solely a pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has shown that, in a subset of patients, certain symptoms − including chest pain, stroke, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and abdominal pain – all indicate a role of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in the disease process. Many of these disease processes persist long after the acute disease has been resolved, resulting in ‘long COVID’ or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and systemic conditions associated with COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Appropriate animal models provide a method of understanding underlying disease mechanisms at the system level through the study of disease progression, tissue pathology, immune system response to the pathogen and behavioral responses. However, very few studies have addressed PASC and whether existing models hold promise for studying this challenging problem. Here, we review the current literature on cardiovascular, neurological and GI pathobiology caused by COVID-19 in patients, along with established animal models of the acute disease manifestations and their prospects for use in PASC studies. Our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of appropriate models in order to recapitulate certain aspects of the disease to enhance the translatability of mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to impact multiple organ systems, including the brain, and is associated with increased cognitive decline in vulnerable populations. The gut microbiome may play a significant role in modulating these effects, as shifts in microbiota composition have been linked to inflammation and systemic disease processes. Methods/Study Population: To explore these interactions, we conducted an acute COVID-19 study using 12-week-old C57 mice intranasally inoculated with 1x10^4 PFU of the Mouse Adapted 10 (MA-10) strain of SARS-CoV-2. On day 5 postinfection, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing on fecal samples, analyzed using QIIME2 and DeSeq2, to assess microbiome alterations and identify changes in metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory responses. Results/Anticipated Results: Analysis revealed notable shifts in the gut microbiome during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, with significant alterations in metabolic pathways related to inflammation and immune regulation. These changes suggest that early gut microbiome disruptions may contribute to the host response in acute COVID-19. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Our findings indicate that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to rapid alterations in the gut microbiome, which could underlie inflammatory and immune pathways impacting disease progression. These insights highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapies to mitigate acute COVID-19 morbidity and warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Aim COVID‐19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) as a pandemic infectious disease. So far, it has been known that this virus uses several receptors to enter the host cell, one of which is neuropilin‐1 (NRP1). Also, one of the main causes of clinical manifestations, severity of disease, and mortality of patients is cytokine storm syndrome, one of these cytokines being interleukin (IL)‐6. Our aim was to study the level of expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Materials and Methods Our study population included the test group (80 patients with COVID‐19) and the control group (30 healthy individuals). Venous blood was taken from all subjects. After isolating PBMCs from blood using Ficoll, RNA was extracted. Then, cDNA synthesis, the expression level of NRP1 and IL‐6 compared to GAPDH housekeeping gene was measured by real‐time PCR. Results The level of NRP1 gene expression was increased significantly in COVID‐19 different groups compared to the control group. Surprisingly, it was observed that the amount of NRP1 gene decreased in the vaccinated group compared to nonvaccinated groups. IL‐6 gene expression was also significantly increased in all groups except vaccinated patients compared to the control group. Also, the results indicated that there was a positive and statistically considerable relationship between IL‐6 expression level and NRP1 expression level (p = 0.03). Conclusion The significant increase in the expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients, especially in moderate and severe cases, indicates their potential involvement in the progression of the disease, which may serve as biomarkers of disease severity. Also, since these genes play an important role in causing severe inflammation, cytokine storm, and immunopathological complications of COVID‐19, further investigations maybe needed to achieve therapeutic goals to control COVID‐19 and similar diseases.">

One of the main molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of Neuro-PASC, in individuals of all ages, is the formation and inadequate proteolysis/clearance of phase-separated amyloid crystalline aggregates—a hallmark feature of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. Amyloidogenesis during viral infection and persistence is a natural, inevitable, protective defense response that is exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2. Acting as chemical catalyst, SARS-CoV-2 accelerates hydrophobic collapse and the heterogeneous nucleation of amorphous amyloids into stable β-sheet aggregates. The clearance of amyloid aggregates is most effective during slow wave sleep, when high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—a biphasic modulator of biomolecular condensates—and melatonin are available to solubilize amyloid aggregates for removal. The dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics by SARS-CoV-2, in particular fusion and fission homeostasis, impairs the proper formation of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations that can remedy challenges created by the diversion of substrates away from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis to support viral replication and maintenance. The subsequent reduction of ATP and inhibition of melatonin synthesis during slow wave sleep results in incomplete brain clearance of amyloid aggregates, leading to the development of neurological manifestations commonly associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Exogenous melatonin not only prevents mitochondrial dysfunction but also elevates ATP production, effectively augmenting the solubilizing effect of the adenosine moiety to ensure the timely, optimal disaggregation and clearance of pathogenic amyloid aggregates in the prevention and attenuation of Neuro-PASC.">

        <tr id="Most new cancer diagnoses occur in patients over the age of 65. The composition and function of the immune system changes with age, but how the aged immune system affects responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) cancer therapies remains incompletely understood. Here, using multiplex cytokine assay and high-parameter mass cytometry, we analyze prospectively collected blood samples from 104 cancer patients receiving ICIs. We find aged patients ( ≥ 65-years-old; n = 54) derive similar clinical outcomes as younger patients (n = 50). However, aged, compared to young, patients have divergent immune phenotypes at baseline that persist during ICI therapy, including diminished cytokine responses, reduced pools of naïve T cells with increased relative expression of immune checkpoint molecules, and more robust effector T cell expansion in responders compared to non-responders. Our study provides insights into age-stratified mechanisms of ICI effects while also implying the utility of age-tailored immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Although the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the emergence of the post-COVID-19 condition presents a new and complex public health challenge, characterized by persistent, multisystem symptoms that can endure for weeks or months after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, significantly affecting survivors’ quality of life. Among the most concerning sequelae are cardiovascular complications, which encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial damage, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This narrative review explores the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health by reviewing the latest and most relevant findings in the literature and highlighting different aspects of COVID-19’s cardiovascular involvement. This review investigates the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular involvement in the post-COVID-19 condition, with a focus on direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, immune-mediated cardiovascular injury, cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial injury. The interplay between pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19 is also explored, revealing that individuals with such conditions are at heightened risk for both severe acute illness and long-term complications. Long-term immune activation and the persistence of viral antigens are increasingly recognized as contributors to ongoing cardiovascular damage, even in individuals with mild or asymptomatic initial infections. As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a deeper understanding of these cardiovascular manifestations is essential. This knowledge will inform the development of targeted strategies for prevention, clinical management, and rehabilitation of affected patients. Furthermore, the insights gained from the intersection of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping responses to future viral epidemics, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches to patient care and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (e.g. H5N1) infects the lower airway to cause severe infections, and constitute a prime candidate for the emergence of disease X. The nasal epithelium is the primary portal of entry for respiratory pathogens, serving as the airway's physical and immune barrier. While HPAI virus predominantly infects the lower airway, not much is known about its interactions with the nasal epithelium. Hence, we sought to elucidate and compare the differential responses of the nasal epithelium against HPAI infection that may contribute to its pathology, and to identify critical response markers. We infected human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) cultured at the air–liquid interface from multiple healthy donors with clinical isolates of major human seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, influenza B) and HPAI H5N1. The infected cells were subjected to virologic, transcriptomic and secretory protein analyses. While less adapted to infecting the nasal epithelium, HPAI H5N1 elicited unique host responses unlike seasonal influenza. Interestingly, H5N1 infection of hNECs induced responses indicative of subdued antiviral activity (e.g. reduced expression of IFNβ, and inflammasome mediators, IL-1α and IL-1β); decreased wound healing; suppressed re-epithelialization; compromised epithelial barrier integrity; diminished responses to oxidative stress; and increased transmembrane solute and ion carrier gene expression. These unique molecular changes in response to H5N1 infection may represent potential targets for enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for better surveillance and management of HPAI infection in humans.">

        <tr id="Approximately four months after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, around 25% of individuals developed visuoconstructive deficit (VCD), which was found to be correlated with an increase in peripheral immune markers and alterations in structural and metabolic brain imaging. Recently, it has been demonstrated that supplemental vitamin B12 regulates hyperinflammation during moderate and severe COVID-19 through methyl-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, whole peripheral blood cultures were produced using samples obtained from patients with confirmed persistent VCD, and controls without impairment, between 10 and 16 months after mild COVID-19. This experimental model was used to assess the leukocyte expression patterns of 11 biomarkers previously associated with VCD in long COVID and explore the potential of pharmacological B12 in regulating these genes. The results showed that patients with persistent VCD displayed continued upregulation of CCL11 and LIF compared to controls. It is worth noting that elevated serum levels of CCL11 have been previously linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the addition of 1 nM of vitamin B12 to blood cultures from individuals with VCD normalized the mRNA levels of CCL11, upregulated the neuroprotective HGF, and, to a lesser extent, downregulated CSF2 and CXCL10. There was an inverse correlation observed between CCL11 mRNA levels and methylation levels of specific cytosines in its promoter region. These findings underscore the significance of systemic inflammation in persistent VCD associated with long COVID. Moreover, the study provides evidence suggesting that B12, acting as an epidrug, shows promise as a therapeutic approach for addressing this cognitive impairment.

        <tr id="Background Defining the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is critical for informing the management of reinfections, vaccinations, and therapeutics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Using four antibody assays, we evaluated antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and receptor binding domain (RBD) in 98 convalescent participants with varying COVID-19 disease severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe) at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months post-SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR and in 17 non-vaccinated, non-infected controls. Results Increasing acute COVID-19 disease severity correlates with higher anti-N and anti-RBD titers throughout 12 months post-infection. Anti-N and anti-RBD titers decline over time in all participants, except for increased anti-RBD titers post-vaccination, with hospitalized participants exhibiting faster decay rates. Less than 50% of participants retain anti-N titers above controls at 12 months, with non-hospitalized participants falling below controls sooner. Nearly all participants maintain anti-RBD titers above controls for 12 months, suggesting long-term protection against severe reinfections. Nonetheless, by 6 months, few participants retain >50% of their initial 1-month anti-N or anti-RBD titers. Notably, vaccine-induced anti-RBD titers are higher in non-hospitalized participants. Lastly, early convalescent titers correlate with age but not with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) status or steroid use. Conclusion Hospitalized participants initially develop higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that decline faster relative to non-hospitalized participants. While anti-N titers fall below control levels in some participants, anti-RBD titers remain above controls over 12 months, demonstrating long-lived antibody responses known to protect against severe disease. These findings advance our understanding of COVID-19 antibody dynamics.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a pandemic around the world. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the epidemiology and seasonality of other traditional respiratory viruses, e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, etc. These traditional respiratory viruses have transmission mode and clinical symptoms similar to SARS-CoV-2 but may differ in clinical outcomes and management. Co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature but have shown mixed evidence in clinical outcomes. With SARS-CoV-2 evolving into mild Omicron variants, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, which in turn affect the epidemiology and clinical course of respiratory viral infections. In response to these changes, multiplex molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses are attracting more attention in the field and have been developed into a variety of testing modalities. In this review, we describe the seasonality (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), epidemiology, and clinical significance of traditional respiratory viruses and their co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, we review commonly used multiplex molecular tests and their applications for the detection of respiratory viruses and their co-infections. Altogether, this review not only sheds light on the epidemiology and clinical significance of respiratory viral infections and co-infections in the post-COVID era, and but also provides insights into the laboratory-based diagnoses of respiratory viral infections using multiplex molecular testing.">

        <tr id="Introduction SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) share similarities in their modes of transmission, pathophysiological symptoms, and clinical manifestations. An imbalance in the immune response characterised by elevated levels of some inflammatory cytokines caused by tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 may increase the risk of developing a severe disease-like condition. It has been reported that TB increases the expression levels of Ace2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) and Tmprss2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) proteins, which are essential for COVID-19 pathogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variants of ace2 and tmprss2 genes can impact virus and host-cell interactions and alter immune responses by modulating cytokine production. This may modify the susceptibility and/or severity in COVID-19-infected people. The role of SNPs in ace2 and tmprss2 in relation to Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection is relatively underexplored. Method In this study, genotype frequency of 10 SNPs of ace2 and 03 SNPs of tmprss2 genes in a Cameroonian cohort consisting of COVID-19-positive (n = 31), TB-positive (n = 43), TB-COVID-19 co-infected (n = 21), and a control group (n = 24) were studied. The immune response was estimated by quantitating inflammatory cytokine levels alongside self-reported and clinically diagnosed symptoms. The relationship between specific genetic mutations in these ace2 gene SNPs and their impact on cytokine expression levels in Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients was investigated. Results We identified wild-type, heterozygous, and double-mutant genotypes in seven SNPs (rs2285666, rs6632677, rs4646116, rs4646140, rs147311723, rs2074192 and rs4646142) in ace2 gene, which showed significant variations in distribution across the study groups. Our most significant findings include the association of double mutant alleles (AA) of rs4646140 and rs2074192 in the ace2 gene with decreased IL-6 and IL-2 expression levels respectively in TB-COVID-19 participants. Also, the double mutant alleles (AA) of rs4646116 were responsible for increased expression level of IL-2 in TB-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, elevated serum levels of AST, urea, and D-dimer, as well as increased plasma concentrations of IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, have been associated with co-infections involving Mtb and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion These biomarkers may reflect the complex interplay between the two pathogens and their impact on host immune responses and disease progression. This study highlights the critical role of genetic and immunological factors in shaping altered immune responses during co-infections involving Mtb and SARS-CoV-2. By elucidating these factors, the findings provide a foundation for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and their implications for disease progression and outcomes. Furthermore, this research has the potential to drive advancements in diagnostic approaches enabling more accurate detection and monitoring of co-infections.">

Clustering analysis using the K-prototypes method identified underlying biological patterns in patients with COVID-19. The penalized multinomial logistic regression analysis identified two comorbidities (hypertension, congestive heart failure) and thirteen analytes as potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression with 88.2% accuracy. Based on a patient’s age, high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and pentraxin 3 were important biomarkers for lethal COVID-19. Decreased concentrations of interferon gamma-induced protein-10, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I were found to be associated with mild COVID-19, while increasing concentrations of these analytes could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: An overwhelming burden to clinics, herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is a painful disease that occurs frequently among aged individuals with a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection history. The cause of shingles is the reactivation of dormant VZV in the dorsal root ganglia/cranial nerves of the human body. Patients with HZ experience sharp, intense, electric shock-like pain, which makes their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) extremely low. Methods: Various mRNA constructs were designed based on intracellular organelle-targeting strategies and AI algorithm-guided high-throughput automation platform screening and were then synthesized by in vitro transcription and encapsulated with four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Immunogenicity was evaluated on a naïve mouse model, long-term mouse model, and VZV-primed mouse model. Safety was evaluated by a modified “nestlet shredding” method for potential adverse effects induced by vaccines. Comparison between muscular and intradermal administrations was conducted using different inoculated approaches as well. Results: The best vaccine candidate, CVG206, showed robust humoral and cellular immune responses, durable immune protection, and the fewest adverse effects. The CVG206 administered intradermally revealed at least threefold higher humoral and cellular immune responses compared to intramuscular vaccination. The manufactured and lyophilized patch of CVG206 demonstrated good thermal stability at 2–8 °C during 9 months of storage. Conclusions: The lyophilized mRNA vaccine CVG206 possesses remarkable immunogenicity, long-term protection, safety, and thermal stability, and its effectiveness could even be further improved by intradermal administration, revealing that CVG206 is a promising vaccine candidate for HZ in future clinical studies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the virus’s unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish it from other respiratory pathogens. It is known that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) activates a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell survival, contributing to the wide range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of HIF-1α is a key driver of systemic inflammation, silent hypoxia, and pathological tissue remodeling in both the acute and post-acute phases of the disease. This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in INPLASY. It involved a literature search in Scopus and PubMed, supplemented by manual reference screening, with study selection facilitated by Rayyan software. Our analysis clarifies the dual role of HIF-1α, which may either worsen inflammatory responses and viral persistence or support adaptive mechanisms that reduce cellular damage. The potential for targeting HIF-1α therapeutically in COVID-19 is complex, requiring further investigation to clarify its precise role and translational applications. This review deepens the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue dysfunction in hypoxia, offering insights for improving clinical management strategies and addressing long-term sequelae.">

 Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ended, the enduring health impacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continue to garner global attention, as approximately 10% of patients develop long COVID (post COVID-19 condition). The epidemiological characteristics and symptoms of long COVID have been reported, and various pathogenic hypotheses have been proposed. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or fragments persist in some patients post-infection and that these are correlated with long COVID symptoms. This review focuses on clinical studies linking SARS-CoV-2 persistence to long COVID symptoms, and explores the relationship between viral persistence and other etiological hypotheses, such as immune dysregulation, vascular issues, coagulation dysfunction, microbiome dysbiosis, brainstem/vagus nerve signaling dysfunction, and latent virus reactivation. Futhermore, treatment strategies for long COVID are proposed based on current clinical trials of antiviral and immune modulation therapies. Understanding the role of viral persistence in long COVID pathogenesis is critical for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical management of this debilitating condition.

Type III interferons (IFN), including IFN lambda 4 (IFNλ4), expressed in individuals harboring the rs368234815-ΔG allele, are implicated in host immune responses to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.We investigated associations between IFNλ4 expression through genotyping and COVID-19 disease severity in 853 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases enrolled in the All-Ireland Infectious Diseases Cohort. Additionally, we measured plasma levels of Type I, II and III IFN using quantitative immunoassays along with IFNλ4 expression and COVID-19 disease severity in a sub-group [n=321 (37.6%)] with samples available within 10 days of symptom onset. IFNλ4 was expressed in 382 (44.8%) but expression was not significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity.Within the sub-group, we found no consistent associations between IFNλ4 expression and circulating IFNs. However, we observed significantly increased expression of IFNλ1 and IFNλ2 in severe COVID-19 (P<0.01), with IFNλ2 remaining significantly associated after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, including obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) (P<0.001). Interestingly, although IFNλ2 levels were significantly higher in subjects with obesity, the association between higher IFNλ2 and COVID-19 disease severity was only observed in individuals without obesity (P<0.01).These data reveal an important role for IFNλ2 as an immune correlate that predicts COVID-19 disease severity, which may be masked in those with obesity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a β-herpesvirus that establishes asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent individuals but can cause severe or even life-threatening symptoms in immunocompromised patients. HCMV can replicate in a wide variety of cells through the engagement of diverse cell factors with the viral envelope protein gH/gL/gO (trimer) or gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131a (pentamer), allowing for systemic spread within the human host. This study explores HCMV infection tropism and dynamics in human microglia, demonstrating the susceptibility of microglia to both clinical and laboratory HCMV strains, albeit with lower efficacy for the laboratory strain, implying that both the gH/gL-trimer and -pentamer can mediate virus entry in microglia. The importance of the gH/gL pentamer for virus entry was demonstrated by the inhibition of virus infection upon pre-incubation with a soluble neuropilin-2 (NRP-2) entry factor. Further, we demonstrated that HCMV infection can be effectively inhibited by monoclonal antibodies specific for the gH/gL complexes and HCMV hyperimmunoglobulin. Lastly, we report that microglia infection can be prevented by newly characterized chemical entry inhibitors. Altogether, these findings underscore the potential of microglia as valuable models for studying HCMV neurotropism and strategies to block virus infection in cells that can impact neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Systemic inflammatory conditions are classically characterized by an acute hyperinflammatory phase, followed by a late immunosuppressive phase that elevates the susceptibility to secondary infections. Comprehensive mechanistic understanding of these phases is largely lacking. To address this gap, we leveraged a controlled, human in vivo model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation encompassing both phases. Single-cell RNA sequencing during the acute hyperinflammatory phase identified an inflammatory CD163+SLC39A8+CALR+ monocyte-like subset (infMono) at 4 h post-LPS administration. The late immunosuppressive phase was characterized by diminished expression of type I interferon (IFN)-responsive genes in monocytes, impaired myelopoiesis and a pronounced attenuation of the immune response on a secondary LPS challenge 1 week after the first. The infMono gene program and impaired myelopoiesis were also detected in patient cohorts with bacterial sepsis and coronavirus disease. IFNβ treatment restored type-I IFN responses and proinflammatory cytokine production and induced monocyte maturation, suggesting a potential treatment option for immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is widely posited to be a key pathogenic mechanism linking acute organophosphate (OP)-induced status epilepticus (SE) to persistent brain injury and abnormal electrical activity that contribute to epilepsy and cognitive impairment. The plasminogen activation system (PAS) promotes neuroinflammation in diverse neurological diseases but whether it is activated following acute OP intoxication has yet to be evaluated. To address this data gap, we characterized the spatiotemporal expression patterns of multiple components of the PAS in a rat model of acute intoxication with the OP, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im) and 2-pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im) went into SE that persisted for hours. One day after acute DFP-induced SE, plasmin activity and protein concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the plasma were increased, though not significantly. In contrast, acute DFP intoxication significantly increased brain levels of PAI-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and transcripts of TGF-β in a time- and region-dependent manner. In the cortex and hippocampus, quantification of PAI-1, tPA, and uPA by ELISA indicated significantly increased levels at 1 day post-exposure (DPE). PAI-1 and uPA returned to control values by 7 DPE while tPA protein remained elevated at 28 DPE. Immunohistochemistry detected elevated PAI-1 expression in the DFP brain up to 28 DPE. Co-localization of PAI-1 with biomarkers of neurons, microglia, and astrocytes demonstrated that PAI-1 localized predominantly to a subpopulation of astrocytes. Cytologically, PAI-1 localized to astrocytic end feet, but not adjacent neurovascular endothelium. Electron microscopy revealed neuronal metabolic stress and neurodegeneration with disruption of adjacent neurovascular units in the hippocampus post-DFP exposure. These data indicate that acute DFP intoxication altered PAS expression in the brain, with aberrant PAI-1 expression in a subset of reactive astrocyte populations.

        <tr id="Respiratory delivery of the Toll-like receptor 5 agonist FLAMOD, a recombinant flagellin, offers a promising approach for treating bacterial pneumonia. FLAMOD stimulates the airway epithelium, mobilizing and activating immune cells and effectors to combat infections. While previous evidences were obtained in mouse models, this study represents the first comprehensive assessment of FLAMOD delivered by nebulization in pigs. Our results demonstrate that a single nebulization of FLAMOD did not cause any adverse effects on clinical parameters. Histological analysis supported that FLAMOD treatment led to immune cell infiltration in the lung tissue, indicative of an active immune response. Flow cytometry confirmed granulocyte recruitment in conducting airways. RNA sequencing established immune activation across the respiratory tract, from the nose, trachea, bronchi to the lungs, highlighting innate immunity, bacterial defense, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and granulocyte chemotaxis as key biological pathways. These findings demonstrated the capacity of FLAMOD to induce a robust and common immune response throughout the porcine respiratory system as well as specific compartmentalized immune signatures. This study establishes FLAMOD as a potent activator of innate immunity, providing a proof-of-concept for inhalation-based therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial pneumonia in the clinical setting.">

It is well known that breast milk is adapted to meet the needs of infants, providing the appropriate amounts of nutrients and various bioactive compounds that contribute to the maturation of the immune system and antioxidant protection, safeguarding infants against diseases. While its composition is variable, breast milk contains immune cells, antibodies, and cytokines, which have anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial properties that strengthen infant immunity. Since COVID-19 vaccines have not yet been approved for infants under six months of age, newborns rely on the passive transfer of antibodies via the placenta and breast milk to protect them against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several studies that analyzed breast milk samples in the context of COVID-19 have demonstrated that a strong antibody response is induced following maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of maternal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through natural infection and/or vaccination on the immunological composition of breast milk based on the studies conducted on this topic.">

        <tr id="Paediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) is characterised by abrupt onset obsessive compulsive disorder and regression in neurodevelopmental skills, triggered by infection or stress. Whether PANS is a distinct entity or part of a neurodevelopmental spectrum is uncertain, and its pathophysiology remains unclear. We show that children with PANS (n=32) and other non-PANS (n=68) neurodevelopmental disorders (total n=100) have higher reported early childhood infections and a loss of previously acquired developmental skills compared to neurotypical controls (n=58). Children with PANS have normal routine immune testing, however bulk RNA-sequencing (PANS n=20 vs controls n=15) revealed upregulated pathways in ribosomal biogenesis and RNA methyltransferases, and downregulated pathways in diverse cellular functions such as mitochondrial activity, cell signalling, endocytosis, and immune responses. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (PANS n=2 vs controls n=2) confirmed these findings but showed heterogeneity across immune cell types. Toll-like receptor stimulation assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed reduced TNF and interleukin-6 responses in PANS patients (n=7) compared to controls (n=7). RNA sequencing before and after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in PANS patients (n=9 vs controls n=10) revealed reversal of the dysregulated ribosomal, epigenetic, and cell signaling pathways. Given the central role of the immune system in synaptic pruning and neurodevelopment, these insights provide rationale for novel epigenetic and immune modulating therapies to optimize neurodevelopmental trajectories and minimize neuropsychiatric impairment.">

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: To assess the effect on the immune response to COVID-19 in children exposed to pesticides. The hypothesis is that increased pesticide exposure results in different immunological response to COVID-19. The goal of the proposal is to improve scientific knowledge on factors affecting COVID-19 and identify a modifiable factor to reduce these disparities. Methods/Study Population: A cross-sectional analysis of children (aged 5–17 years) with asthma to assess pesticide exposure and immune markers of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination was determined with blood exposome RNA analyses assessed from blood samples taken at baseline. Immunological response was measured using neutralizing, phagocytizing, and NK-activating antibody responses biomarkers using plasma antibody isotyping, effector functions, T-cell activation-induced marker (AIM), and recall cytokine secretion assays on lysed, whole blood. Pesticide exposure was assessed as concentration of four urinary metabolites in a spot urine sample adjusted for creatinine. Unadjusted regression models were created to assess the effect of 3-phenoxy benzoic acid, a common pyrethroid pesticide, on immune markers. Results/Anticipated Results: Children’s (N = 30) average age was 10 years (interquartile range: 8–11) A majority of children were male (63%) and Non-Hispanic Black (73%). The majority of children had markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection (77%). Of the 4 pesticide metabolites assessed, only 3-PBA was commonly found (77% of samples > LOQ). Higher urinary concentrations of 3-PBA are associated with a significant (p Discussion/Significance of Impact: Significant associations in cytokine and inflammatory marker may indicate a Th2-skewed response, and dysregulated cytokine responses can lead to severe disease. A suggested increase in T-cell activation markers (e.g., CD4, CD8) may indicate potential exhaustion if excessively activated.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has been responsible of COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemia and can cause a variety of symptoms including gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain and liver injury. The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed in gut and SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, creating an inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, as widely described at the lung level. Case presentation This work presents the case of a middle-aged Caucasian man admitted to the Hospital Emergency Department from the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy), complaining of pain in the upper and middle region of the abdomen. The patient tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from viral infection. The patient required resection of a segment of ileum and an ulcer of the bowel wall was recognized and sampled. Previous published results had confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) and an altered morphology of microvilli in the ulcerated ileum of the patient when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum. The present study sought to deepen the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we evaluated the expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin by immunohistochemical techniques. VEGF immunohistochemical expression was higher in the ulcer than in the control ileum sample and the non-ulcerated ileum areas and co-expressed with the SPIKE protein. Fibronectin staining was lower in control sample than in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. Electron microscopy analysis showed alterations of the integrity of the intestinal barrier in the ulcerated area when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum or to the control sample. Conclusions Although the patient was tested negative to nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, the SPIKE protein was detected in his terminal ileum, especially in the ulcerated areas. The presence of the viral protein was also associated with an increase of VEGF and Fibronectin. In addition to vascular changes, the SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the junctional apparatus among epithelial cells, making the tissue even more fragile and thus susceptible to the entry of pathogens and the development of further infections.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 is characterized by the persistence of symptoms and immune alterations beyond the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the demographic, clinical, and immunological differences between individuals with and without long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This observational study included 206 participants, comprising 90 patients with long COVID-19 and 116 without. Data on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were collected, alongside immune cell profiles and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Statistical analyses compared these parameters between the two groups. Long COVID-19 patients were predominantly female (77.8%), older (47.78% aged 41–60, 20% >60 years), and had higher BMI, hypertension (31.1%), and autoimmune diseases (11.1%) compared to nonlong COVID-19 individuals (P < 0.001). Clinical symptoms unique to long COVID-19 included memory loss (40.0%), hair loss (37.8%), fatigue (35.6%), and myalgia/arthralgia (28.9%), all absent in the control group (P < 0.001). Immunologically, patients with long COVID-19 exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), reduced B cells, and higher CD4/CD8 ratios. Moreover, long COVID-19 patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, with 15.5% showing levels between 1000–2500 BAU/ml, compared to 6.9% in controls. These immunological biomarkers, including altered T cell subsets and antibody levels, highlight the complex immune dysregulation associated with long COVID-19. These findings could inform future clinical management and therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Understanding factors that predict progression to severe COVID-19 is critical. Antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein confer protection, while the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays roles in viral replication and immune dysfunction. This study explores the significance of N protein and anti-spike antibodies on disease severity, progression, and mortality. Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 N protein and anti-spike antibody levels with disease severity, clinical outcomes, and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Design: A secondary analysis of serologic data from participants in the ACTIV-1 randomized clinical trial, which evaluated immunomodulators for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A subanalysis of the ACTIV-1 immune modulator trial was conducted. Samples collected at randomization were tested for N protein levels and anti-spike antibodies. Logistic regression and linear models were employed to examine the association between serological measures and clinical outcomes, including 28-day mortality as well as progression to high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Results: Among the 496 participants with detectable serum N protein, the median was 1143 ng/dL, and levels decreased from 2559 ng/dL in participants randomized at 6 days of symptom onset to 477.6 ng/dL at 11 days. Higher anti-spike antibody levels were seen as the days from symptom onset progressed or disease severity increased. Greater disease severity at randomization was associated with 28-day mortality, prolonged days of oxygenation, ventilation, hospitalization, and risk of new non-invasive ventilation, HFNC, MV, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use. N protein levels were associated with a higher risk of new non-invasive ventilation or HFNC use, longer oxygenation duration, and extended hospitalization. Anti-spike antibody serologies were not associated with clinical outcomes. Conclusion: N protein levels could provide insights into COVID-19 disease progression and prognosis. Further research is needed to explore the clinical implications of these findings to optimize patient care and enhance outcomes.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus’ ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.">

Results We found that neutrophils, immature granulocytes, and monocytes were elevated, and lymphocytes were reduced after infection. These hyperactive neutrophils/immature granulocytes and suppressed lymphocytes/monocytes were associated with poorer prognosis in ancestral strain infection. Different from the ancestral strain, hyperactive immature granulocytes were not shown in the decedents of Delta infection, and immature granulocyte concentration was not observed to be associated with mortality.

        <tr id="Purpose of review Nonhuman primate (NHP) models of HIV-1 infection provide complementary experimental pathways for assessing aspects of acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) that cannot be addressed in humans. This article reviews acute infection studies in SIV-infected or SHIV-infected macaque species over the previous 18 months. Recent findings Reviewed studies examined the dynamics of replication-competent viral reservoir establishment during early infection, reservoir maintenance throughout therapy, and factors influencing viral rebound after treatment cessation. Also discussed are acute infection events in the central nervous system and liver and potential links between these events and manifestations of comorbidities during chronic infection. Additional studies addressed how occurrences during acute infection impact the development of natural viral control or posttreatment control. Another report evaluated treatment during acute infection with broadly neutralizing antibodies with enhanced ability to engage innate immune cells, highlighting the ability of this early intervention to shape innate and adaptive antiviral responses. Summary NHP models of HIV-1 infection are a fundamental research tool for investigating AHI events. These models enable detailed pathogenesis characterization and the testing of hypothesis-driven strategies for altering disease courses through interventions during AHI, including targeting viral persistence and comorbidities that persist throughout chronic infection.">

        <tr id="The type I interferons (IFNs) are a group of key cytokines of the vertebrate innate immune system that induce an antiviral state in uninfected cells. Experimental in-vitro and in-vivo data have proven the fundamental role these cytokines possess in the protective response to a wide variety of pathogens, including herpesviruses. In a clinical setting, IFNs have been an important treatment in humans for several decades and increasing evidence demonstrates their potential in controlling viral haemorrhagic fevers when administered early in disease. In juvenile Asian elephants, elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus haemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD) often proves fatal when an effective adaptive immune response cannot be mounted in time, suggesting that an enhancement of the innate immune response could provide protection. This study sequenced six members of the Asian elephant type I IFNs, most closely related to sequences from the African elephant and Florida manatee. Subsequently, recombinant Asian elephant IFNα and IFNβ proteins were expressed and assessed for bioactivity in-vitro, relative to recombinant human IFNs, using a novel infection model incorporating primary Asian elephant fibroblasts and bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) as a surrogate for EEHV. In a dose-dependent manner, both Asian elephant IFNs and human IFNα2a protected cells from BoHV-1 infection in this proof-of-concept study, even if applied up to 24 hours post-infection in-vitro.">

        <tr id="Background Neurological manifestations are present in about one-third of COVID-19 cases, ranging from mild symptoms, such as anosmia, to more severe forms like demyelinating syndromes. Although direct invasion of the CNS has been demonstrated, the immune- mediated pathway is also described and more accepted. Even in cases where viral detection in CSF is absent, it should not rule out neuroinvasion. There are few prospective studies about neurological manifestations of COVID-19, especially with viral tests in CSF; as well there are still many questions about COVID-19 associated with neurological disease. Thus, we describe clinical and CSF findings of a prospective cohort of patients with nasal positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 and neurological involvement. We also discuss the pathogenic mechanisms related to these manifestations. Methods and Findings This is a prospective cohort study; 27 patients were evaluated according to clinical presentation, the time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and onset of neurological alterations, syndromic diagnosis, imaging and CSF findings. Real time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 genome was performed in all CSF samples. 2 RT-PCR in spinal cord fluid resulted positive in 9 (33.3%) cases, five of them had a positive swab nasal test concomitant to neurologic disease. Respiratory signs were described in 12 out 27 patients, five of them with viral detection in CSF. White cell counts in CSF were normal range in the majority of cases, except for 3 occurrences: two patients had elevated CSF WBC counts and viral detection in CSF (10 and 36 cells/mm3) and one also had elevated CSF WBC count but viral detection in CSF was negative (21cells/mm3). The observed neurological signs encompassed a diverse neurologic spectrum, including seizures, paresis, gait abnormalities, headaches, alteration in consciousness and memory or cognitive impairment. Both imaging and CSF alterations exhibited non-specific characteristics. Syndromic diagnoses included stroke, dementia or cognitive impairments, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, acute flaccid palsy and optical neuritis. Conclusions The patients in the present study had COVID-19 and neurologic involvement including a wide range of clinical manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in one-third of CSF samples, regardless of time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and the onset of neurological signs. These conditions encompass various pathogenic pathways and the neuroinvasion potential of SARS-CoV-2 should be more studied.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Common cold coronaviruses were a frequent cause of respiratory infections in older adults living in congregate care homes before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which may influence immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination and infection. We investigated humoral and cellular immune responses to prior common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, how they are affected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection, and their associations with Omicron BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of long-term care and retirement homes. Methods In SARS-CoV-2 infection–naive residents with 3 monovalent messenger RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, we measured serum anti–receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and common cold human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E; ancestral and Omicron BA.1 neutralizing antibodies; and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation responses to membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike proteins. We examined the relationships of common cold coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune responses, whether antibody and T-cell responses changed after SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccination or infection, and their associations with Omicron BA.1 infection. Results Anti-RBD IgG HCoV-OC43 titers were positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. Common cold coronavirus anti-RBD IgA titers, but not anti-RBD IgG titers, increased after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, and many residents had cross-reactive T cells. Common cold coronavirus humoral immunity was similar in residents without and those with subsequent Omicron BA.1 infection. Conclusions Despite frequent exposure, and associations of common cold coronavirus and vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity, preexisting common cold coronavirus immunity was not associated with Omicron BA.1 infection in residents of long-term care and retirement communities.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Background: The coronavirus–caused disease (COVID-19), first identified in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide becoming a global pandemic. Although people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus presented mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in cardiovascular incidents was observed in several scientific studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response leading to a dysregulation of immune system function and massive production of inflammatory cytokines commonly known as “cytokine storm”. Methods: 57 patients eventually participated in the study, assigned to non–COVID (24 patients) and COVID (33 patients) groups. After signing consent to participate in the study, each patient was given a self–administered questionnaire to fill out prior to specimen collection, anthropometric measurements were taken and venous blood was collected for the following determinations: pro- and anti–inflammatory cytokines using a Bio–Plex 200 system, oxidative stress markers and basic hematological blood parameters. Results: showed statistically significant higher values of IL–1Ra and IL–1β in the COVID-19 group. Of the oxidative stress markers, only MDA levels were higher in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: the results of our study provide evidence and support the occurrence of elevated levels of IL–1Ra, IL–1β and MDA in the COVID-19 group of patients, which are associated with a worse course and prognosis of COVID-19. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and dysregulation of the immune system associated with the cytokine storm is essential to select patients at risk and develop effective drugs and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a devastating autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) with limited treatment options. Several studies have shown attenuation of the well-characterized GBS preclinical experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) model with systemically administered therapeutic compounds via anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory mechanisms. Despite this, clinical advancement of these findings is limited by dosing that is not translatable to humans or is associated with off-target and toxic effects. This is due, in part, to the blood-nerve barrier (BNB), which restricts access of the circulation to peripheral nerves. However, during acute neuroinflammation, the normally restrictive BNB exhibits increased vascular permeability and enables immune cell infiltration. This may offer a unique window to access the otherwise restricted peripheral nerve microenvironment for therapeutic delivery. Here, we assessed the degree to which BNB permeability and immune cell infiltration over the course of EAN enables accumulation of circulating nanoparticles. We found that at disease stages defined by distinct clinical scores and pathology (onset, effector phase, and peak of EAN severity), intravenously administered small molecules and nanoparticles ranging from 50 to 150 nm can permeate into the endoneurium from the endoneurial vasculature in a size- and stage-dependent manner. This permeation occurs uniformly in both sciatic nerves and in proximal and distal regions of the nerves. We propose that this nerve targeting enabled by pathology serves as a platform by which potential therapies for GBS can be reevaluated and investigated preclinically in nanoparticle delivery systems.">

        <tr id="Lassa fever is a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. In the absence of efficient prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures, it poses a substantial threat to public health in this region. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the severity of the disease are poorly known because Lassa virus (LASV), its causative agent, has to be handled in BSL-4 laboratories and access to clinical samples is difficult. The control of Lassa fever is associated with a rapid and well-balanced immune response and viral clearance. However, severe disease is characterized by uncontrolled innate immune activation and symptoms reminiscent of sepsis and a cytokine storm. In a model of cynomolgus monkeys infected with two different strains of the virus, one causing moderate disease and the other a lethal outcome, we show that the control of LASV infection is characterized by the induction of a LASV-specific T-cell response, whereas severity is associated with the expansion of suppressive myeloid cells, alterations of the stromal network of secondary lymphoid organs, and the anergy of specific T cells. These results suggest that T cells are crucial for the control of LASV and that immunomodulatory therapeutics, such as checkpoint inhibitors, could contribute to new therapeutic strategies to treat Lassa fever. They also highlight how immunosuppressive mechanisms described in sepsis and cancer patients may play a role in the pathogenicity of Lassa fever, as well as in other similar hemorrhagic fevers.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most patients recover fully after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2. Some, however, may develop pulmonary sequelae (PS) and/or long COVID (LC). However, whether these two clinical conditions have similar or different pathogenic mechanisms is unknown. Methods The levels of autoantibodies and 184 inflammatory and organ damage associated proteins in plasma were determined (by immunofluorescence and Olink panels, respectively) 1 year after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 51 patients with PS (DLCO < 80% ref), 31 patients with LC and 31 patients fully recovered (Rec). PS was defined by the presence of reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) lower than 80% ref. LC was defined by the presence of chronic symptoms in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Results We found that patients with PS or LC both showed increased levels than Rec of anti-microbial, immune cell activation and recruitment related proteins. Patients with PS showed higher levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies, whereas LC patients had increased levels of organ-damage associated proteins. In patients with PS most of the elevated proteins correlate with the impairment of lung function (DLCO). Finally, in PS we additionally performed the determinations at an earlier time point (6 months) and showed that the expression of CCL20 and IFN-ɣ was already higher at 6 months, while CCL3 and CCL19 increase from 6 to 12 months, suggesting a pathogenic role in PS persistence. Conclusions Patients with PS or LC have abnormal but different persistent circulatory immune and organ damage biomarkers, suggesting different underlying biology of both post-COVID conditions.

        <tr id="Close relatives of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 continue to circulate in wildlife, posing an ongoing threat of zoonotic spillover. While vaccination played a key role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, variants of concern (VOC) with immune evasive substitutions emerged on multiple occasions, causing widespread breakthrough infections. The combined threats of zoonosis and newly emerging VOCs, coupled with the potential for recombination, underscore the need to assess the breadth of existing vaccine-mediated protection. Here, we investigate a cohort of older individuals (median age 68.5 years) for the potential of cross-neutralisation against Omicron lineage VOC and animal sarbecoviruses induced by four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Despite the recent use of a bivalent mRNA vaccine dose (encoding spike from Wu-1 and omicron), we observed that neutralisation of Omicron lineage VOCs such as BA.1 and BA.2 were reduced compared to SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1, suggesting an imprinted immune response from pre-Omicron lineage viruses. Similarly, both SARS-CoV-1 and a SARS-CoV-1-related bat CoV were neutralised less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that two animal SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, BANAL-20-52 (from bats) and a pangolin-CoV, were more sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1 itself. These surprising findings suggest that vaccine-mediated adaptive immunity may provide efficient cross-protection against certain animal sarbecoviruses.">

        <tr id="Background: Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aims to evaluate immune system markers, including antigen-specific antibodies, B cell subsets, and Th2-related cytokines, in individuals with long COVID and to investigate their potential impact on the development of this condition. Methods: We analyzed blood plasma from 63 individuals diagnosed with long COVID based on clinical presentation and 47 healthy individuals with COVID-19 history but no clinical symptoms. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies were measured using commercial ELISA kits. Lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed via flow cytometry and a gating strategy based on CD27 and CD38. Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) were quantified using the xMAP multiplex assay. Results: We noted no significant differences in IgG levels between groups. Notably, individuals with long COVID demonstrated a higher percentage of naive mature B cells (CD27−CD38+), while transitional (CD27−CD38+++) and double-negative (DN, CD27−CD38-) cells were significantly reduced. Elevated levels of IL-5 and IL-13 were observed in long COVID patients. Classification analysis revealed that the percentage of transitional B cells (CD27−CD38+++) was a strong predictor of long COVID. Conclusions: Our findings highlight alterations in B cell dynamics among individuals with long COVID, which may contribute to autoimmune processes.">

        <tr id="Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that utilizes its type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to inject virulence factors into host cells and colonize the host. In turn, a subset of cytosolic immune receptors respond to T3SS ligands by forming multimeric signaling complexes called inflammasomes, which activate caspases that induce interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokine release and an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Human macrophages mount a multifaceted inflammasome response to Salmonella infection that ultimately restricts intracellular bacterial replication. However, how inflammasomes restrict Salmonella replication remains unknown. We find that caspase-1 is essential for mediating inflammasome responses to Salmonella and restricting bacterial replication within human macrophages, with caspase-4 contributing as well. We also demonstrate that the downstream pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) and Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1), a mediator of terminal cell lysis, play a role in controlling Salmonella replication in human macrophages. Notably, in the absence of inflammasome responses, we observed hyperreplication of Salmonella within the cytosol of infected cells as well as increased bacterial replication within vacuoles, suggesting that inflammasomes control Salmonella replication primarily within the cytosol and also within vacuoles. These findings reveal that inflammatory caspases and pyroptotic factors mediate inflammasome responses that restrict the subcellular localization of intracellular Salmonella replication within human macrophages.">

        <tr id="Cellular innate immune pathways are formidable barriers against viral invasion, creating an environment unfavorable for virus replication. Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in driving and regulating these cell-intrinsic innate antiviral mechanisms through the action of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The host IFN response obstructs viral replication at every stage, prompting viruses to evolve various strategies to counteract or evade this response. Understanding the interplay between viral proteins and cell-intrinsic IFN-mediated immune mechanisms is essential for developing antiviral and anti-inflammatory strategies. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses, encode a range of proteins that, through shared and distinct mechanisms, inhibit IFN-mediated innate immune responses. Compounding the issue, a dysregulated early IFN response can lead to a hyper-inflammatory immune reaction later in the infection, resulting in severe disease. This review provides a brief overview of HCoV replication and a detailed account of its interaction with host cellular innate immune pathways regulated by IFN.">

        <tr id="Background The manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection range from flu-like symptoms to severe lung disease. The consequences of this inflammatory process impact overall function, which can be detected through both short- to long-term assessments. This study aimed to assess the pulmonary functional and structural characteristics of post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with mild/moderate, severe, and critical clinical presentations. Methods An observational, analytical, and cross-sectional study was conducted between 2020 and 2022, including participants with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, with mild/moderate (G1), severe (G2), and critical (G3) clinical presentations, all evaluated at least 3 months after acute infection. Spirometry, impulse oscillometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), chest computed tomography, the 6-min walk test (6MWT), hand grip strength, maximum inspiratory pressure, and maximum expiratory pressure were assessed. Results We enrolled 210 participants aged 18–70 years, 32.6% of whom were male, with older age observed in G3. The participants were grouped as follows: G1 (42.3%), G2 (25.7%), and G3 (31.9%). Percentage of predicted X5 differed between G1 and G2, being higher in G1. The percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) according to the Global Lung Function Initiative and its z-score were higher in G1. The FVC by Pereira was lower in G3 compared to G1. The percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) by Pereira was also lower in G3. The Tiffeneau (FEV1/FVC) index was different among groups, increasing with disease severity. The percentage of predicted forced expiratory flow rate at 25–75% (FEF25-75%) of the FVC and FeNO were both higher in G2 than G1. Chest computed tomography revealed the presence of interstitial abnormalities, associated with disease severity. The respiratory muscle strength evaluation showed an association between higher maximum expiratory pressure values in G3 compared to G1, but no association with maximum inspiratory pressure was observed. The 6MWT distance covered decreased with increasing severity, with a lower percentage of predicted values in G3 compared to G1. The right-hand grip strength was also lower in G3 compared to G1. Conclusion Alterations in pulmonary and functional markers were observed in post-COVID-19 evaluations, increasing with disease severity, as seen in G2 and G3. These findings highlight the complexity of post-COVID-19 functional assessments, given the long-term pulmonary sequelae and the consequent impairment of functional capacity.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence indicate that individual host immune response to pathogens may be as important as virulence factors in determining the severity of infection. However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology®™ software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NFκ-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response. Author Summery Infections often cause personal suffering, but also high economic costs. Brain infections such as bacterial or viral meningitis are particularly serious and carry a high risk of death or permanent disability. At the same time, resistance to anti-infective drugs is increasing and fewer new antibiotics are being developed. As a result, there is a great need for translational research to develop new treatments beyond conventional anti-infectives. Due to its strict compartmentalisation, the brain is well suited to identify specific pathogen-dependent, but also host (patient) dependent inflammatory patterns in infections. Using a cohort of patients with a defined group of pathogen-specific meningitis, we investigated the inflammatory patterns in the cerebrospinal fluid and were able to describe new specific pathogen-dependent and new host-dependent immune responses and identify associated signalling pathways. We were also able to show how and at what cellular and molecular level the blood-brain barrier is disrupted by infection. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier is an important aspect and has major implications for the course and prognosis of brain infections. Once the pathogen- and host-specific aspects of the immune response are understood, new personalised therapeutic approaches can be developed that directly target the regulation of the individual immune response.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Newborns under 6 months of age are at high risk of hospitalization for acute respiratory failure following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Herein, we analyzed neonatal protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 passively acquired after mother vaccination and/or infection (hybrid immunity). Methods We enrolled seventy‐eight newborns of immunized mothers against SARS‐CoV‐2 before or during pregnancy, through vaccination and/or infection. Infants were stratified based on the anamnestic lack (SARS‐CoV‐2 Vaccinated – SV)/presence (SARS‐CoV‐2 Infected and Vaccinated – SIV) of COVID‐19 maternal infection. SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific Neutralizing Activity (NA) in plasma was assessed by virus neutralization assay (vNTA) against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron strain at delivery (T0), 3 and 6 months after birth (T3 and T6). Cytokine and chemokine profiles in newborns were also analyzed. Results At birth, significantly lower NA was observed in infants of SV compared to that of SIV mothers; NA declined equally in both groups 3 months after delivery. The presence of at least 4 immunizing events in the mother significantly enhances the NA against SARS‐CoV‐2 in newborns, regardless of the type of immunization (vaccination or hybrid immunity) and of the timing of the last maternal immunization. Finally, cytokines and chemokines plasma levels were high at birth in all newborns, followed by a decline over the subsequent month. Conclusion Our findings suggest that, independently of a previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or vaccination, it is reasonable to upgrade the recommendation of a booster dose during pregnancy to a “strongly recommended” status, with a view to conferring protection to newborns in the first months after delivery.">

        <tr id="Despite the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, there still remain risks of new aggressive strains of coronavirus. As the human population increases progressively, it is mandatory to ensure both preventive measures and an immediate response to emerging infectious threats. Another essential component for rapidly restraining a new possible pandemic is the development of new anticoronaviral therapeutics. In the present study, the anticoronaviral capabilities of Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) are characterized. It is demonstrated that the administration of GcMAF to Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the first phase of infection (six days postinfection) is accompanied by (i) a statistically significant reduction in the viral load of the lung tissue and (ii) the switching of the inflammatory status of the lung tissue to a neutral one in terms of mRNA expression levels of the groups of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The potential mechanism for this antiviral action and the containment of the inflammatory response by the drug associated with the engagement of terminal N-acetylgalactosamine GcMAF and C-type lectin domain containing 10A expressed at the surface of lung-infiltrating macrophages and pneumocytes, which simultaneously express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is discussed.">

        <tr id="Severe infections such as malaria are on the rise worldwide, driven by both climate change and increasing drug resistance. It is therefore paramount that we better understand how the host responds to severe infection. Hematopoiesis is particularly of interest in this context because hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the turnover of all blood cells, including all immune cells. Severe infections have been widely acknowledged to affect HSPCs; however, this disruption has been mainly studied during the acute phase, and the process and level of HSPC recovery remain understudied. Using a self-resolving model of natural rodent malaria, infection by Plasmodium chabaudi, here we systematically assess phenotypically defined HSPCs’ acute response and recovery upon pathogen clearance. We demonstrate that during the acute phase of infection the most quiescent and functional stem cells are depleted, multipotent progenitor compartments are drastically enlarged, and oligopotent progenitors virtually disappear, underpinned by dramatic, population-specific and sometimes unexpected changes in proliferation rates. HSPC populations return to homeostatic size and proliferation rate again through specific patterns of recovery. Overall, our data demonstrate that HSPC populations adopt different responses to cope with severe infection and suggest that the ability to adjust proliferative capacity becomes more restricted as differentiation progresses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective To elucidate crucial immune cell subsets and associated immunological pathways by stratifying patients with immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) using immunophenotyping and transcriptomic approaches. Methods We conducted flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses in 23 immune cell subsets derived from 235 patients with six IMDs, using our database, utilizing our database, ImmuNexUT. Patients were stratified based on immunophenotyping data. Subsequently, we examined clinical and transcriptomic differences among these stratified clusters. Results Patients with IMDs were stratified into two clusters based on their immunophenotypes. Cluster 1 was enriched with differentiated B cells, including unswitched memory B cells (USM B), switched memory B cells, double-negative B cells and plasmablasts, while cluster 2 was enriched with naïve B cells. Higher disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and decreased respiratory functions in systemic sclerosis were observed in cluster 1, whereas the disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus was higher in cluster 2. Numerous differentially expressed genes were detected in USM B. Cluster 1 was associated with glycosylation processes in USM B and elevated B cell-activating factor signalling from myeloid cells in B cells, while cluster 2 exhibited higher B-cell receptor signalling in USM B. Patients in cluster 2, which had an elevated age-associated B-cell signature, exhibited more frequent flares, suggesting that an increased proportion of naïve B cells with this signature is associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion Immunophenotyping-based clusters and transcriptome-based states revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in B cells. To predict IMD prognosis, assessing both the quantity and quality of naïve B cells may be crucial.">

        <tr id="Introduction. It is now known that 30% of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 develop long-COVID. According to researchers, the reactivation of herpesviruses plays a significant role in triggering long-COVID. In these patients, alteration in lymphocyte populations and T-lymphocyte subpopulations have been observed, yet the nature of these changes remains unclear. The dysregulation of the immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 is further exacerbated by the reactivation of human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6). Therefore, it is essential to distinguish immune response alterations in long-COVID patients based on HHV-6 reactivation and consider these differences when developing therapeutic approaches. 
The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the associative relationships between the number of lymphocyte populations, T-lymphocyte subpopulations, and the severity of the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with long-COVID; 2) to determine and compare the percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD56+, CD8+, CD4/25/127– T-regs and CD19+ cells in long-COVID patients depending on the presence of reactivated HHV-6. 
Materials and methods. In our study, we examined 124 patients, including 73 women (59%) and 51 men (41%), with an average age of 43±9.70 years, all of whom had suffered from COVID-19 in the second half of 2023. To confirm HHV-6 reactivation and form study groups, molecular genetic studies (PCR) were conducted on all patients. Subsequently, flow cytometry was used to analyze the lymphocyte populations and subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from the patients. 
Results. In patients with long-COVID following severe COVID-19, the percentage of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ cells, and CD4+CD25+CD127– T-regs was significantly lower both in the absence of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.014; p=0.016; p=0.045, respectively) and during the active phase of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.045; p=0.005; p=0.008, respectively), compared to the control group. CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased only during the active phase of the herpesvirus (p=0.045). Notably, in the active phase of HHV-6, these cells were further reduced compared to those without herpesvirus reactivation. Additionally, the number of CD19+ B cells was significantly elevated in patients with HHV-6 reactivation, compared to both the control group (p<0.0001) and patients without HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0002). Furthermore, the percentage of CD56+ NK cells in patients with long- COVID following mild and moderate COVID-19 in the history, without HHV-6 reactivation, did not differ significantly from the control group. However, NK cells were significantly lower in patients with long-COVID after severe COVID-19 in the context of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0001). 
Conclusions. Our data confirm that HHV-6 reactivation after COVID-19 plays a role in the development of long-COVID. This is mediated through dysregulation of adaptive immune cell interactions, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and increased production of antibodies with defective structure. Based on our results, patients with long- COVID following severe COVID-19, in the context of HHV-6 reactivation, may have an elevated risk of immunopathological complications, potentially including autoimmune disorders. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and potential therapeutic strategies.">

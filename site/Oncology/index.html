        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily targets ciliated cells during the initial infection of the upper respiratory tract. Since uncertainties persist regarding other involved epithelial cell types, we here utilized viral replication analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spectral microscopy on infected air-liquid interface cultures of human primary nasal and bronchial epithelial cells to discern cell type proportions in relation to SARS-CoV-2 tropism and immune activation. We revealed that, next to ciliated and secretory cells, SARS-CoV-2 (wild type and lineage B1.1.7 [Alpha variant]) strongly infects basal cells, significantly contributing to the epithelial immune response in a donor-specific manner. Moreover, local Camostat mesylate treatment was effective on both the basal and apical cell compartment, resulting in a notable reduction in viral load and reduced immune activation. Collectively, our data emphasize the critical role of basal cells in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 dissemination within the upper respiratory tract and their substantial contribution to the epithelial immune response. Furthermore, our results highlight the potential of local application of Camostat mesylate as an effective strategy for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigating associated immune activation early on.">

        <tr id="At this stage in the COVID-19 pandemic, most infections are "breakthrough" infections that occur in individuals with prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. To refine long-term vaccine strategies against emerging variants, we examined both innate and adaptive immunity in breakthrough infections. We performed single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional profiling of primary and breakthrough infections to compare immune responses from unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the SARS-CoV-2 Delta wave. Breakthrough infections were characterized by a less activated transcriptomic profile in monocytes and natural killer cells, with induction of pathways limiting monocyte migratory potential and natural killer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a female-specific increase in transcriptomic and proteomic activation of multiple innate immune cell subsets during breakthrough infections. These insights suggest that prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination prevents overactivation of innate immune responses during breakthrough infections with discernible sex-specific patterns and underscore the potential of harnessing vaccines in mitigating pathologic immune responses resulting from overactivation.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a debilitating condition, severely impacting the daily functioning and quality of life of affected individuals. The pathogenesis of Long COVID is complex and multifactorial, involving immune dysregulation, persistent inflammation, and potential reactivation of other pathogens. A key driver of Long COVID is the potential persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues beyond the respiratory tract, leading to the formation of viral reservoirs that contribute to ongoing symptoms, several months after initial infection. These reservoirs have been suggested in the gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and other tissues, often persisting months after the initial infection. Additionally, viral RNA and proteins in these tissues are associated with chronic inflammation and immune system disruptions, which are primary contributors to Long COVID symptoms. This article explores the mechanisms and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in respiratory and non-respiratory tissues, highlighting its impact on the immune system and underscoring critical areas for future research to improve outcomes for individuals suffering from Long COVID.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

The global impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in significant health consequences
for populations worldwide. While COVID-19 is typically an acute disease, there have been
cases of chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection, commonly referred to as long COVID. This condition has
been associated with various metabolic disorders, including an increased risk of heart attacks, type -1
diabetes, and ischemic strokes. Type-1 diabetes can develop in individuals who have contracted
COVID-19 due to the direct or indirect damage caused to the pancreas, leading to decreased secretion
of insulin, which in turn causes an increase in blood glucose levels. SARS-CoV-2 can also affect
the heart as it can damage endothelial cells, leading to endotheliosis and endothelitis, further causing
the inflammation of the cardiovascular system followed by a heart attack. Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes
with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be another reason for heart attack. In the brain, the presence
of SARS-CoV-2 can cause a hyperinflammatory state and immune response, leading to microvascular
thrombosis leading to ischemic stroke. SARS-CoV-2 may also directly damage neurovascular
units, causing ischemic stroke. Moreover, alteration in the oral and gut microbiome, as well as hepatic
lipoprotein metabolism with SARS-CoV-2 infection, results in the development of hyperlipidemia/
dyslipidemia. This review aims to establish a correlation between chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection
and the development of these metabolic disorders following an acute infection. Additionally, the
mechanisms involved in the development of these disorders as a long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2
infection have also been thoroughly discussed to understand the possible pharmaceutical management
of these interconnected metabolic diseases.

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that is one of the most significant challenges to public health over the past few years. Most people are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but older adults are more vulnerable. Aging is one of the major risk factors for the detrimental consequences of COVID-19, likely due to chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, both of which are the characteristics of old age. Immunosenescence refers to the weakening of the immune system with age while inflammaging describes the low-grade chronic inflammation seen in older individuals. One key aspect of human aging is immune deficiency. During aging, our body's defense system weakens, resulting in decreased responses to infection by novel pathogens and a reduced ability to become immunized. The presence of chronic inflammation and viral infection in old age may cause several adverse unpredictable outcomes increasing the propensity and severity of the disease and requires to be considered, enabling people to better prepare for the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. This requires consideration so that individuals can better be prepared to address the potential consequences of this ongoing pandemic. In this review, we discuss the clinical characteristics of elderly COVID-19 patients and survey the associated molecular pathways that are pivotal for the interactions of the coronavirus and host cellular responses, including immunosenescence, inflammation, telomere attrition, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in major aging signaling pathways, which are crucial for the discovery of new therapeutic and preventive methods in the ongoing pandemic.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID‐19 commonly leads to respiratory issues, yet numerous patients also exhibit a diverse range of neurological conditions, suggesting a detrimental impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 or the viral Spike protein on the central nervous system. Nonetheless, the molecular pathway behind neurological pathology and the presumed neurotropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains largely unexplored. We generated human cortical organoids (HCOs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to assess: (1) the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 main entry factors; (2) their vulnerability to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; and (3) the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to the Spike protein on their transcriptome. Results proved that (1) HCOs express the main SARS‐CoV‐2 receptors and co‐receptors; (2) HCOs may be productively infected by SARS‐CoV‐2; (3) the viral particles released by SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected HCOs are able to re‐infect another cellular line; and (4) the infection resulted in the activation of apoptotic and stress pathways, along with inflammatory processes. Notably, these effects were recapitulated when HCOs were exposed to the Spike protein alone. The data obtained demonstrate that SARS‐CoV‐2 likely infects HCOs probably through the binding of ACE2, CD147, and NRP1 entry factors. Furthermore, exposure to the Spike protein alone proved sufficient to disrupt their homeostasis and induce neurotoxic effects, potentially contributing to the onset of long‐COVID symptoms.">

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to have neurotropism and therefore to lead to not only peripheral inflammatory responses but also neuroinflammation. Because the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), can be found in many intraocular tissues, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also contribute to persistent intraocular neuroinflammation, microcirculation dysfunction and ocular symptoms. Increased awareness of neuroinflammation and future research on interventional strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for improving long-term outcomes, reducing disease burden, and improving quality of life. Therefore, the aim of this review is to focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and intraocular neuroinflammation and to discuss current evidence and future perspectives, especially possible connections between conditions and potential treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

Among these, the mutations in the spike (S) protein are of particular importance, as they play a more critical role in the virus's adaptive evolution and transmission. In this review, we summarize the phylogenetic relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses in non-human animals, and delves into the lineage classification of SARS-CoV-2 and the impact of key amino acid variations on viral biological characteristics.

        <tr id="The genome-based surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the past nearly 5 years since its emergence has refreshed our understanding of virus evolution, especially on convergent co-evolution with the host. SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations that affect the functional properties of the virus by altering its infectivity, virulence, transmissibility, and interactions with host immunity. This poses a huge challenge to global prevention and control measures based on drug treatment and vaccine application. As one of the key evasion strategies in response to the immune profile of the human population, there are overwhelming amounts of evidence for the reduced antibody neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally, data also suggest that the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against variants or sub-variants decrease in the populations, although non-negligible cross-T-cell responses are maintained. Herein, from the perspectives of structural immunology, we outline the characteristics and mechanisms of the T cell and antibody responses to SARS-CoV and its variants/sub-variants. The molecular bases for the impact of the immune escaping variants on the interaction of the epitopes with the key receptors in adaptive immunity, that is, major histocompatibility complex (MHC), T-cell receptor (TCR), and antibody are summarized and discussed, the knowledge of which will widen our understanding of this pandemic-threatening virus and assist the preparedness for Pathogen X in the future.">

Although vaccines and antiviral treatments are available, hospitalizations remain steady, and concerns about long-term consequences persist. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop novel therapies. Here, we analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication while building an antiviral cellular defense. Our study reveals that miR-155 expression is elevated in patients with COVID-19. Using a mouse model transgenic for human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, we evaluated the potential of anti-miR-155 therapy. Treating SARS-CoV-2-infected mice with anti-miR-155 significantly reduced miR-155 expression, improved survival, and slightly increased body weight. Notably, these mice showed altered expression of cytokines in the lungs. These findings suggest anti-miR-155 could be a promising therapy to mitigate the cytokine storm and long-lasting symptoms induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, improving public health outcomes and enhancing global pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="In recent years, the novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to over 670 million infections and nearly 7 million deaths worldwide. The global pandemic of COVID-19 has precipitated a significant public health crisis. The prevalence of liver function abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 is as high as 53% among healthy individuals or patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and shows a positive correlation with disease severity; moreover, specific adaptive immune responses can influence the trajectory and outcomes of COVID-19. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 may impact autoimmunity through mechanisms such as excessive stimulation of immune responses and molecular mimicry, particularly in genetically predisposed individuals. Currently, the overall mutational trend of SARS-CoV-2 indicates heightened infectivity and immune evasion capabilities. Consequently, vaccination remains crucial for universal protection against this disease. Nevertheless, alongside the widespread implementation of vaccination programs globally, an increasing number of cases have been documented where COVID-19 vaccination appears to trigger new-onset autoimmune hepatitis; yet definitive evidence is still pending elucidation regarding causality. In this review, we analyse the clinical-immunological characteristics, risks associated with severe disease progression, and prognosis for AIH patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; discuss the detrimental effects exerted by SARS-CoV-2 on hepatic function; summarise the mechanisms and attributes leading to new-onset AIH; as well as provide insights into how vaccination may interfere with autoimmunity processes. We continue to underscore the significance of vaccination while aiming to enhance awareness concerning potential risks associated with it—this could facilitate better management strategies for autoimmune diseases along with appropriate adjustments in vaccination protocols. Although the precise triggering mechanism linking COVID-19-related events to AIH remains unclear, existing evidence suggests that this relationship is far from coincidental.">

Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

        <tr id="Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection.Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11–14 days later.Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation.The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus responsible for COVID-19, interacts with the host immune system through complex mechanisms that significantly influence disease outcomes, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. These interactions are crucial in determining the disease's severity and the host's ability to clear the virus. Given the virus's substantial socioeconomic impact, high morbidity and mortality rates, and public health importance, understanding these mechanisms is essential. This article examines the diverse innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2's structural proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, along with nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open reading frames. These proteins play pivotal roles in immune modulation, facilitating viral replication, evading immune detection, and contributing to severe inflammatory responses such as cytokine storms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The virus employs strategies like suppressing type I interferon production and disrupting key antiviral pathways, including MAVS, OAS-RNase-L, and PKR. This study also explores the immune pathways that govern the activation and suppression of immune responses throughout COVID-19. By analyzing immune sensing receptors and the responses initiated upon recognizing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, this review elucidates the complex pathways associated with the innate immune response in COVID-19. Understanding these mechanisms offers valuable insights for therapeutic interventions and informs public health strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has been associated with significant cardiovascular complications, including fibrosis, functional impairment, and chronic inflammatory and immune responses. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these cardiac pathologies following COVID-19 infection remain understudied. Previously, we characterized a mouse model of long COVID and observed enhanced expression of kinin B1 receptor (B1R) in the infected animals. Here, we investigated the role of B1R in mediating long COVID induced cardiac pathologies. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated at 28 days post-infection (dpi) to model long COVID and the effects of pharmacological blockade of B1R were evaluated. Persistent upregulation of B1R expression was accompanied by apoptosis, disrupted cardiomyocyte architecture, fibrosis, impaired gap junction integrity, and sustained inflammation and immune cell infiltration. B1R blockade restored gap junction integrity, reduced fibrosis and apoptosis, and mitigated inflammation and immune activation. Together, these data indicate that B1R plays a critical role in long COVID induced cardiac remodeling and damage, highlighting its potential as a target for treating long-lasting cardiovascular complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections have been hypothesized to play a key role in the emergence of variants of concern. However, the factors determining which individuals are at risk and their viral molecular signatures during infection remain poorly understood. Using the extensive COVID-19 surveillance database in Denmark, comprising over 700,000 genomes, we identified 303 persistent infections and, critically, linked them to health and sociodemographic data. Our analysis confirms the hypothesis that immunocompromised individuals are at the highest risk of experiencing persistent infections. Other disease groups associated with mortality, such as diabetes, showed no such associations. Among these persistent infections, the viral sequences exhibited signs of diversifying selection, with recurrent mutations linked to treatment resistance. Our findings suggest that immunosuppression plays a key role in the emergence of novelty in persistent infections.">

        <tr id="A major challenge with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been assessing the intensity, dynamics, and determinants of the antibody responses after infection and/or vaccination. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody responses among naturally infected individuals and individuals who achieved hybrid immunity in a large Canadian cohort. We demonstrate that anti-Spike IgGs and neutralizing antibody dynamics vary greatly among individuals with COVID-19, in peak antibody levels, rate of waning, and longevity of the antibody response. Additionally, we found an association between robust antibody responses and individuals with severe COVID-19 clinical symptoms during the first-month post-symptom onset. For individuals who achieved hybrid immunity, a robust increase in anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibodies followed the first vaccination dose; however, there was a minimal increase in the anti-S1 IgGs and neutralizing antibody titers after administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies elicited by the wild-type virus alone were largely ineffective against emerging variants of concern in our natural infection-only cohort, in contrast to a much broader and more robust neutralization profile observed in individuals who achieved hybrid immunity. Our findings emphasize the need for global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efforts to further sustain protective immune responses required to minimize viral spread and disease severity in the population. As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, understanding the interplay between previous infections, vaccine durability, and virus evolution will be critical for guiding ongoing vaccination strategies.

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a pandemic around the world. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the epidemiology and seasonality of other traditional respiratory viruses, e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, etc. These traditional respiratory viruses have transmission mode and clinical symptoms similar to SARS-CoV-2 but may differ in clinical outcomes and management. Co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature but have shown mixed evidence in clinical outcomes. With SARS-CoV-2 evolving into mild Omicron variants, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, which in turn affect the epidemiology and clinical course of respiratory viral infections. In response to these changes, multiplex molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses are attracting more attention in the field and have been developed into a variety of testing modalities. In this review, we describe the seasonality (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), epidemiology, and clinical significance of traditional respiratory viruses and their co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, we review commonly used multiplex molecular tests and their applications for the detection of respiratory viruses and their co-infections. Altogether, this review not only sheds light on the epidemiology and clinical significance of respiratory viral infections and co-infections in the post-COVID era, and but also provides insights into the laboratory-based diagnoses of respiratory viral infections using multiplex molecular testing.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 involves several organs, but its basis remains poorly understood. Some infected cells in mice survive the acute infection and persist for extended periods in the respiratory tract but not in other tissues. Here, we describe two experimental models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to assess the effect of viral virulence on previously infected cells. Both approaches use lineage tracking of previously infected cells. In mice infected with a highly pathogenic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, alveolar type 2 cells (AT2) but not alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells survived the acute infection. These cells became activated, differentiated into an AT2-to-AT1 transitional cell state (KRT8+ pre-alveolar type 1 transitional cell state). Additionally, nearby uninfected AT2 cells upregulated the transitional marker KRT8, thereby contributing to lung regeneration. In mice sensitized to infection by transduction with Ad5-hACE2, the infection is nonlethal, and AT1 cells survived the infection. Consequently, recovery in these mice was more rapid. Taken together, these results provide an explanation for how SARS-CoV-2 virulence contributes to poor outcomes and affects clinical recovery and lung regeneration. We also identified a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts lung recovery, even at times when infectious virus cannot be detected. IMPORTANCE A major consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is that many survivors have long-term sequelae, which are not well understood. These involve many organs, with the respiratory tract being a common site of long-term effects. Many of these sequelae can be found in mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we have focused on the lungs, with particular interest in the fate and role of cells that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and survived the acute infection. We found that some infected cells survive acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and that these surviving cells both contribute to the immune response in the lungs and are involved in lung recovery. These findings illustrate previously unexplored aspects of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia and may be relevant for understanding aspects of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="T-cell ageing may be a key factor in the disproportionate severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older populations. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients, treatment involving the use of monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 usually involves the administration of high doses but has not been very effective at preventing complications or fatality, highlighting the need for additional research into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, particularly for older populations. In this study, it is discovered that older persons with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has weaker T-cell responses. Therefore the development and characterization of spike-targeting T-cell-dependent bispecific (TDB) full-length human immunoglobulin Gs with enhanced efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 is described. Using S-targeting TDBs, polyclonal T cells are guided to target and destroy S-expressing cells, preventing the cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby eliminating the need for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Using animal models of COVID-19, it is shown that the selective activation of T cells improves the efficiency of treatment in preinfected mice by attenuating disease-induced weight loss and death. The significance of T-cell-based immunity during infection is highlighted by the findings. These results have implications for better clinical effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 and the development of T-cell-dependent medicines for the elderly population.">

        <tr id="Interpreting viral mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 based on human body level is critical for developing more efficient interventions. Due to the limitation of data, limited models consider the viral dynamics of early phase of infection. The Human Challenge Study Killingley et al. (2022) enables us to garner data from the inoculation to the 14th day after the infection, which provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 within host infection dynamics. In the Human Challenge Study, each volunteer was inoculated with 10TCID50, approximately 55PFU, of a wild type of virus (Killingley et al. (2022)), and the data indicates that the viral load reduced below the detectable level within a day. The simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023) explain the data from the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)). However, they do not explain the viral decay from Day 0 to Day 1. Hence, in this paper, we aim to develop a new viral mechanism to explain this phenomenon. Based on the simplified within host models developed by Xu et al. (2023), we consider that the virus will first go through an adjustment phase and then start to replicate. A new dose-response model is developed to evaluate the probability of infection by constructing a boundary problem. We will discuss this viral mechanism and fit the model to the data of the Human Challenge Study (Killingley et al. (2022)) by adopting AMC-SMC (approximate Bayesian computation-sequential Monte Carlo). Based on the results of parameter inference, we estimate that the adjusted viral load is around 1% of the inoculated viral load.">

        <tr id="Long-COVID affects at least 10% of COVID-19 survivors, displaying debilitating symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the increasing prevalence, the underlying causes remain unclear. This study presents a unique analysis of the PBMC transcriptomic landscape of COVID-19 and Long-COVID patients at a single-cell resolution. We reconstructed the cell state and communication using differentially expressed gene profiling and ligand-receptor interaction analyses. Our results reveal altered T and NK cell subset proportions, diminished proliferating lymphocyte and B cell signalling capacity, and the expression of exhaustion and cytotoxicity associated genes 1.5 – 2 years post-infection, suggesting incomplete immune recovery. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the immune processes underlying the progression of COVID-19 into a chronic Long-COVID state.">

        <tr id="In the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, high case fatality was noted. The case fatality during this was associated with the cytokine storm (CS) or cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Sometimes, virus infections are due to the excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to cytokine storms, which might be directed to ARDS, multi-organ failure, and death. However, it was noted that several miRNAs are involved in regulating cytokines during SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses such as IFNs, ILs, GM-CSF, TNF, etc. The article spotlighted several miRNAs involved in regulating cytokines associated with the cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses (influenza virus, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, dengue virus). Targeting those miRNAs might help in the discovery of novel therapeutics, considering CS or CSS associated with different virus infections.">

        <tr id="Monocytes and macrophages, as important constituents of the innate immune system, are equipped with multiple Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) to recognize invading pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, and mount an antiviral response. Nevertheless, their uncontrolled activation can lead to hyperinflammation seen in severe COVID-19. Surprisingly, we observed that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins triggered only a weak proinflammatory response in human peripheral blood monocytes. By employing THP-1 and Jurkat NF-κB::eGFP reporter cell lines expressing specific TLRs, various TLR ligands and blocking antibodies, we determined that surface TLRs, including TLR2/1, TLR2/6 and TLR4 do not play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 sensing. However, monocytes are potently activated by the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2, and the response correlates with the viral uptake that is observed only in monocytes, but not in lymphocytes. We show that monocyte activation involves two distinct steps. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 infects monocytes in a process independent of the S protein and the prime SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Instead, the alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor CD147, which is highly expressed on monocytes, recognizes its well-known interaction partners cyclophilins A and B that are incorporated into SARS-CoV-2 virions. Secondly, upon viral uptake via the cyclophilin-CD147 interaction, that can be inhibited by specific CD147 blocking antibodies or competition with recombinant human cyclophilin A and B, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is recognized by TLR7/8 in endosomes, leading to upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, comprising the core hyperinflammatory signature. Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism how human monocytes sense SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting the cyclophilin-CD147 axis might be beneficial to alleviate overt myeloid-driven inflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis is a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. The host response correlates of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis remain unclear, thereby limiting therapeutic development. We therefore performed proteomic and transcriptomic phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis in Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. We included a bioenergetics focus given the emerging role of mitochondrial function in enteroviral myocarditis. Early (<30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). Values are log10 transformed, and p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons across the full twenty biomarkers (six shown here; * indicates a p-value < 0.05). CRP = C-Reactive Protein; IFNG = Interferon Gamma ; PCT= Procalcitonin; TNFR1 = Tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; DDIMER = D-dimer; and IL1RA = Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Methods We previously adjudicated five unvaccinated pre-Delta SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis cases among 5265 MHS beneficiaries who enrolled into the EPICC study with COVID-19; four of these cases had blood collected. We matched myocarditis cases 1:10 with sex, age, comorbidity, and blood sampling-time matched controls (SARS-CoV-2 infection with no myocarditis) from the EPICC study. Cases and controls underwent comparison of early (< 30 days post infection) plasma proteomic biomarkers measured by the Ella 20-plex ELISA assay (with multiplicity adjustment). We also performed early whole blood transcriptomic sequencing with DESeq2 and GSEA analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways, including mitochondrial (mtDNA) regulated innate immune pathways (with FDR for multiple comparisons). Gene set enrichment analysis of custom mitochondrial pathways in cases (SARS-CoV-2 infections with myocarditis) versus controls (SARS-CoV-2 infections without myocarditis). FDR = False Discovery Rate; NES = Normalized enrichment score. Results We detected higher post-infection Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (TNFR1) and procalcitonin (PCT) plasma concentrations in myocarditis cases versus matched controls (TNFR1: 0.33 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.032; PCT: 0.59 log10 pg/mL difference, p = 0.02) (Fig 1). We noted no statistically significant difference in the 18 other proteomic markers tested. GSEA analysis noted upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS pathway genes, and downregulated mtDNA innate immune genes, in cases versus controls (FDR < 0.05) (Fig 2). Conclusion In this MHS study, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was associated with elevation of TNFR1 and PCT secretion, upregulated mitochondrial central dogma and OXPHOS gene expression, and downregulated mtDNA innate immunity. While constrained by small sample sizes of a rare complication, these biomarker associations prompt mechanistic studies which may direct development of therapies for myocarditis due to SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other respiratory viral pathogens.

        <tr id="Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations have been reported following infection with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus persists in multiple organs due to its tropism for various tissues, including the skeletal system. This study investigates the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including both ancestral and Omicron viral strains, on differentiating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the precursor cells, into osteoblasts. Although both viral strains can productively infect osteoblasts, precursor cell infection remained abortive. Viral exposure during osteoblast differentiation demonstrates that both variants inhibit mineral and organic matrix deposition. This is accompanied by reduced expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) strongly suggests that the ancestral and Omicron variants may disrupt bone homeostasis by promoting osteoclast differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of bone-resorbing cells. This process is dependent of spike glycoprotein since its neutralization significantly reduced the effect of infective SARS-CoV-2 and UV-C inactivated virus. This study underscores the capacity of ancestral and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants to disrupt osteoblast differentiation, a process essential for preserving the homeostasis and functionality of bone tissue.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Coronaviruses are endemic in the human population and include both seasonal viruses as well as the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), with exposure history differing between children and adults. We sought to identify age-specific differences in memory CD4 T cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), as quantitative and qualitative differences in immune function may be responsible for age-related variation in disease presentation. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from cohorts of children and adults enrolled pre-2019 and following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Subjects enrolled post-pandemic had a history of COVID-19 vaccination. Cells were stimulated with peptide pools representing the unique and more cross-reactive portions of the S protein for 24 hours, with cytokine release blocked for the last 4 hours of coculture. Subsets of S-specific CD4 T cells were identified using a 31-plex spectral flow cytometry panel. Results Pre-pandemic, adults had a higher frequency of activated IFNγ+ CD4 T cells specific for the S protein compared to children, with boosting of responses in both adults and children following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, the CD4 T cell response to the S protein was Th1 biased, with adults having a greater proportion of cells expressing IFNγ, IL2 and TNFα. When cytokine-expressing, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were subsetted by CD45RA and CCR7 expression, there was a more naïve phenotype pre-pandemic, with transition to an effector memory phenotype post-2019. Conclusion A greater magnitude of CD4 T cells specific for the S protein was detected in adults pre-pandemic, with this reactivity boosted in both children and adults following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Boosting of reactivity to both unique and conserved S protein epitopes in children and adults suggested that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 via vaccination did not preferentially boost memory CD4 T cells specific for conserved epitopes. Post-pandemic, there was a shift to a more Th1 phenotype together with a gain in cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with a phenotype consistent with effector memory. Disclosures Jennifer L.

        <tr id="Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) ligands effectively reduce immunopathological damage in viral pneumonia models. Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="While Influenza Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are considered as a significant health burden in children, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes milder diseases in this age group compared to adults. To investigate the involvement of the upper respiratory tract human airway epithelium (HAE) in this pattern, we established an in-house model of reconstituted HAE cultured in air-liquid interface from nasal swabs of children and adults and characterised it before and after ex vivo respiratory viral infections using focused and unbiased approaches. Fully differentiated paediatric HAE exhibited an increasing induction level of genes related to mucociliary clearance, while higher expression of innate immune pathways was found in the ones from adults. While similar viral replication kinetics in both age groups were shown for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A Virus (IAV), RSV and Rhinovirus (RV) infection, transcriptomic analysis showed stronger and earlier induction of IFN-related pathways in SARS-CoV-2-infected HAE from children compared to IAV, RSV and RV. IAV and RSV had the weakest innate immune response increase in HAE from children versus adults. RV infection showed an intermediate pattern, resembling SARS-CoV-2 more than RSV or IAV. Our work demonstrates a distinct sensing of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses ex vivo, which may contribute to the milder course of disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected children and argues for a role of early virus-HAE interaction in shaping viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that innate immune responses towards respiratory viruses are virus-specific and differ between age groups. Hence, findings on SARS-CoV-2 cannot be extrapolated to other respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Dendritic cells (DCs) in severe cases exhibited reduced proportions and attenuated expression of MHC class I genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86), alongside increased cytochrome c expression, indicating impaired antigen presentation and enhanced apoptosis. NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and -2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beta-coronaviruses (β-CoVs) that have caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of host responses to β-CoVs would provide insights into the pathogenesis of these viruses to identify potential targets for medical countermeasures. In this study, our objective is to use a systems biology approach to explore the magnitude and scope of innate immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infection over time in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3/2B4 cells). Total RNA extracted at 12, 24, and 48 hours after β-CoVs or mock infection of Calu-3/2B4 cells were subjected to RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis to select genes whose expressions were significantly modulated post-infection. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 stimulate similar yet distinct innate antiviral signaling pathways in pathologically relevant human lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that many genes related to the viral life cycle, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were upregulated at multiple time points. Based on their profound modulation upon infection by SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron BA.1, four ISGs, i.e., bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), Z-DNA Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CXCL11), and Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1), were identified as potential drug targets against β-CoVs. Our findings suggest that these genes affect both pathogens directly and indirectly through the innate immune response, making them potential targets for host-directed antivirals. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection induce differential effects on host innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are known to impact cellular and humoral immune response in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In this study, we performed in-depth SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell profiling using flow cytometry. T-cell immunity in pwMS with or without DMTs was evaluated before a first SARS-CoV-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination and at one-, two- and six-month follow-up. T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4+ T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4+high and CD4+CD154+ T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8+ T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an outbreak in 2002-2003, spreading to 29 countries with a mortality rate of about 10%. Strict quarantine and infection control methods quickly stopped the spread of the disease. Later research showed that SARS-CoV came from animals (zoonosis) and stressed the possibility of a similar spread from host to human, which was clearly shown by the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic, instigated by SARS-CoV-2, has affected 776 million confirmed cases and more than seven million deaths globally as of Sept 15, 2024. The existence of animal reservoirs of coronaviruses continues to pose a risk of re-emergence with improved fitness and virulence. Given the high death rate (up to 70 percent) and the high rate of severe sickness (up to 68.7 percent in long-COVID patients), it is even more critical to identify new therapies as soon as possible. This study combines research on antivirals that target SARS coronaviruses that have been conducted over the course of more than twenty years. It is a beneficial resource that might be useful in directing future studies.">

Prebiotics seem to be immunomodulators and antiviral agents, therefore strengthening the human immune system according recent scientific data. Prebiotics enhanced the maturation, differentiation, and lymphocyte and macrophage proliferation, thereby increasing COVID-19 immunity. They also triggered the reticuloendothelial system, raised the fraction of CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), and improved COVID-19 immunity by this means. Dietary interventions like prebiotics and anti-SARS-CoV-2 have opened opportunities for the development of microbial therapeutics intended either to prevent or treat COVID-19. Prebiotics are specialized dietary components necessary for the survival and nutritional absorption of gut probiotic microorganisms.">

In an in vitro model of Caco-2 intestinal cell line, we previously found that SARS-CoV-2 modulates the ACE2 receptor expression and affects the expression of molecules involved in intercellular junctions. To further explore the possibility that the intestinal epithelium can serve as an alternative infection route for SARS-CoV-2, we used a model of polarized monolayers of Caco-2 cells (or co-cultures of two intestinal cell lines: Caco-2 and HT29) grown on the polycarbonate membrane of Transwell inserts, inoculated with the virus either in the upper or lower chamber of culture to determine the tropism of the virus for the apical or basolateral pole of these cells. In both polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers and co-culture Caco-2/HT29 cell monolayer, apical SARS-CoV-2 inoculation was found to be much more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. In addition, apical SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers monolayer degeneration, as shown by histological examination, measurement of trans-epithelial electrical resistance, and cell adhesion molecule expression. During apical infection, the infectious viruses reach the lower chamber, suggesting either a transcytosis mechanism from the apical side to the basolateral side of cells, a paracellular trafficking of the virus after damage to intercellular junctions in the epithelial barrier, or both. Taken together, these data indicate a preferential tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for the apical pole of the human intestinal tract and suggest that infection via the intestinal lumen leads to a systemic infection.">

Given the constant evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants, the study aims to assess the potential of these inhibitors in adapting to new challenges and improving treatment outcomes. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was conducted using electronic databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The study analyzed the role of IL-6 inhibitors in combating SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their therapeutic potential in treating severe COVID-19 cases, particularly in controlling the overshooting immune response associated with cytokine storms. IL-6 inhibitors proved to be versatile and effective in attenuating severe immune responses, especially cytokine storms, which are common in advanced COVID-19 cases. The literature emphasizes their ability to regulate the immune system, reduce disease severity, and improve patient outcomes. Their efficacy in controlling the immune response and reducing disease severity makes IL-6 inhibitor antibodies a promising therapeutic strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants. Further research is needed to optimize their use and adaptability in evolving clinical scenarios.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 since 2019 caused substantial global morbidity and mortality and continues to burden healthcare systems worldwide. Public health measures implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread also reduced circulation of other seasonal respiratory viruses, likely causing gaps in population-level immunity. Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may dampen immune responses against other pathogens is highly debated and not well understood.Figure 1. VirScan analyses of serum samples pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (A) VirScan total epitope hits and geometric mean (gMean) of epitope binding (EB) scores for SARS-CoV-2 pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. (B) gMean of EB scores for select pathogens pre- and post- clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Timepoints included in the VirScan analyses were between 15-174 days prior to and 31-155 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gray lines denote paired samples for individual subjects. Statistically significant adjusted p values of < 0.05 were determined using paired t test with Holm correction. Methods In 2022, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunocompetent adults ( > 18 years) with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination history and increased risk of social or occupational exposure to respiratory viruses. Subjects were followed for 6 months and weekly symptom surveys, blood samples at enrollment, 3 and 6 months post-enrollment, and nasal swabs at report of symptoms were collected. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR (OpenArray) for 27 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Serum antibodies were assessed by VirScan PhIP-seq for specificity to a broad library of antigen epitopes for clinically relevant pathogens, measuring total epitope hits and epitope binding (EB) scores, a measure similar to antibody titer. Results Of 43 subjects with paired serum samples > 1 week prior to and > 28 days after clinically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 32 subjects with viral load < Ct 22.2 were assessed by VirScan. SARS-CoV-2 epitope hits and EB scores were significantly increased post-infection compared to pre-infection (Fig 1A). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with reduced EB scores for adenovirus D and S. aureus (Fig 1B). However, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with a statistically significant decline of epitope hits or EB scores for most other clinically relevant pathogens. Conclusion We assessed broad changes in the antibody repertoires of subjects prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection for clinically relevant pathogens at the epitope level by VirScan. Together these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not associated with differential patterns of antibody repertoire kinetics for most non-coronavirus respiratory pathogens in immunocompetent adults. Further analyses in larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Disclosures Michael J.

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector β-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of β-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that β-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of β-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, β-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that β-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.">

        <tr id="Introduction Global WHO data indicate that Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, such as Kenya, experienced reduced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe-morbidity and mortality burdens relative to their more affluent counterparts in Europe, Asia, and North America. Methods We analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples collected from Kenya and Sweden before and during COVID-19. Pre-COVID-19 samples were available for 80 adults and 10 infants from Kenya, and 20 adults from Sweden. COVID-19 samples were available for 39 Kenyan adults. The samples were analysed for ex vivo IFN-{gamma} secretion using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent (ELISpot) assay following in vitro stimulations with overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein peptides. T-cells expressing IFN-{gamma}, IL-2, TNF-, CD154, and CD107a were assessed following similar stimulations, using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and multiparameter flow cytometry. Results 55.7% of the Kenyan pre-COVID-19 adults were classified as responders by ELISPOT responses to spike-protein peptides, compared with 28% of Swedish pre-COVID-19 adults (p = 0.04). The frequencies for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific TNF- CD4+, TNF- CD8+ and IFN-{gamma} CD8+ T-cell responses, tended to be higher in the Kenyan adults although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Pre-COVID-19 T-cell responses could contribute to lower morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in SSA relative to Europe, Asia, and North America.">

        <tr id="The airway epithelium serves as a physical and immune barrier against inhaled insults. This tissue is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and following injury, the airway epithelium undergoes repair to restore barrier function. Though components of SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike glycoprotein essential in viral entry, have been shown to alter biological functions in various tissues, it is unclear how SARS-CoV-2 can impact airway epithelial functions, such as wound repair.In this study, 16HBE14o- epithelial monolayer cultures were treated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 subunit at 4 μg·mL−1or transfected with a plasmid expressing full-length spike glycoprotein. Secreted inflammatory mediators, markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest, culture proliferation, and wound closure measurements following mechanical injury were assessed.Spike treatment and transfection altered measures of culture proliferation and markers of proliferation and cell-cycle arrest. Secreted interleukin-6 but not interleukin-8 were significantly higher with spike S1 treatment, while both were significantly elevated with spike transfection. Wound closure was inhibited by both spike treatment and transfection, with significant reductions compared to control.SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 treatment and transfection can alter measures of proliferation, inflammation, and impair wound closure of 16HBE14o- airway epithelial cells. These results highlight how components of SARS-CoV-2 can impair functions of the airway epithelium independent of viral replication.">

        <tr id="We examined innate and antibody responses in C3PO clinical trial participants of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to identify predictors of disease progression. We found SARS-CoV-2 viremia in 64% of participants at enrollment, and we could also quantify viremia in approximately half of those samples using an RT-PCR assay. Viremia was associated with increased risk of disease progression (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.0). Participants with viremia at baseline had lower SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody levels and higher pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IP-10 (CXCL10), TNF-α, calprotectin, and CRP. Disease progression correlated with extracellular vesicle levels from multiple cell types in the convalescent but not acute phase of the disease. Male sex predicted worse disease outcome and was associated with higher baseline levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Viremia's strong predictive value for disease progression argues for further study of its use to predict which patients with COVID-19 might require more intensive therapy or monitoring.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a significant challenge since the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared as an outbreak in March 2020, marked by diverse symptoms and prolonged duration of disease. Defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting or emerging for at least two months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection without an alternative cause, its prevalence varies globally, with estimates of 10–20% in Europe, 7.3% in the USA, and 3.0% in the UK. The condition’s etiology remains unclear, involving factors, such as renin–angiotensin system overactivation, persistent viral reservoirs, immune dysregulation, and autoantibodies. Reactivated viruses, like EBV and HSV-6, alongside epigenetic alterations, exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance. Emerging evidence links SARS-CoV-2 to chromatin and gut microbiome changes, further influencing long-term health impacts. Diagnosis of long COVID requires detailed systemic evaluation through medical history and physical examination. Management is highly individualized, focusing mainly on the patient’s symptoms and affected systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating diverse perspectives to address systemic manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Enhanced understanding of long COVID’s pathophysiology and clinical features is critical to improving patient outcomes and quality of life. With a growing number of cases expected globally, advancing research and disseminating knowledge on long COVID remain vital for developing effective diagnostic and management frameworks, ultimately supporting better care for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the critical importance of understanding protective long-lasting immune responses. This study investigates the epitope specificity, T cell receptor (TCR) usage, and phenotypic changes in SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells over time in convalescent individuals with COVID-19.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 28 unvaccinated individuals with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (6 identified as the D614G variant, clade 20C) and analyzed up to 12 months post-symptom onset. Antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using specific dextramer and antibody reagents. TCR clonotypes and activation markers were characterized to explore T cell dynamics.SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited waning frequencies long-term, transitioning from memory-like to a naïve-like state. scRNAseq revealed specificity against both spike and non-spike antigens with increased CD95 and CD127 expression over time, indicating that naïve-like T cells may represent stem cell memory T cells, which are multipotent and self-renewing, likely important for long-lived immunity. TCR clonal expansion was observed mainly in memory T cells, with overlapping TCR beta chain (TRB)-complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences between participants, suggesting shared public TCR epitope-specific repertoires against SARS-CoV-2. Further, unique spike-specific CD4+ T cells with high CD95 and CD127 expression were identified, which may play a crucial role in long-term protection.This study highlights epitope-specificity heterogeneity, with some immunodominant responses, and suggests a potential role for long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. Shared TCR repertoires offers insights into cross-reactive and protective T cell clones, providing valuable information for optimizing vaccine strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings underscore the critical role of cellular immunity in long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and emphasizes the importance of understanding T cell dynamics.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes a spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic infection to severe illness to long-term sequelae. Similar to other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 proteins modulate host genomic responses through epigenomic modifications, facilitating viral replication and immune evasion. While the nucleocapsid protein is well known for its role in RNA stability and immune modulation, its impact on host chromatin organization remains unclear. To investigate this, we generated stable human alveolar cell lines expressing nucleocapsid proteins from endemic and pandemic human coronaviruses. Our analysis revealed that nucleocapsid proteins from all tested coronaviruses induced changes in nucleosome positioning and occupancy at specific gene promoters involved in coagulation pathways, hormone signaling, and innate immune responses. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific alterations were identified in genes dysregulated in severe infections, suggesting a direct role for epigenomic modifications in disease pathophysiology. We also observed extensive changes in nucleosome susceptibility to nuclease digestion in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 samples that were not observed in common cold cell lines. Promoters with altered sensitivity and resistance to nuclease were linked to innate immune, metabolic, olfactory, and signaling pathways known to be dysregulated in severe COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae (PASC). These findings demonstrate that nucleocapsid protein expression alters chromatin structure at specific loci, implicating viral proteins in host genome dysregulation. Furthermore, we identified both shared and unique chromatin targets of SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses, highlighting pathways for further investigation and potential therapeutic intervention. Importance Host chromatin is known to be modulated by coronaviruses during infections. However, the role of the nucleocapsid protein in these alterations are unknown. Here, we show that nucleocapsids from seven human coronaviruses alter nucleosome distribution and susceptibility to enzymatic digestion over specific gene promoters in a human lung cell line. Nucleocapsids from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the most prominent effects which are seen over genes involved in immune responses, metabolism, hormone signaling, and other pathways that are known to be dysregulated in severe COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: SARS-CoV-2 provokes acute oxidative stress in the lungs via cytokines, inflammatory mediators, and apoptotic factors, which might cause alveolar injury followed by severe respiratory syndrome during COVID-19 infection. The lack of particular antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 has opened novel avenues of complementary and alternative medicine as a potential remedy. The current study explored the mechanistic role of the ultradiluted formulation of Eupatorium (UDE) against SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S protein-mediated oxidative stress and mitochondriopathy. Methods: Cell line and BALB/c mice were used to report that SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused an inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm via the NF-κB pathway in the lung along with oxidative damage. Morphological examination was performed using DAPI staining and histology for treated cells and lung tissues of animals, respectively. The molecular mechanism of action of UDE was investigated through qRT-PCR for the genetic expressions of various cytokines, inflammatory, and apoptotic mediators; ELISA, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot for the translational expression of the same molecules assayed for genetic expressions; and biochemical assays for various enzymes and ROS. Results: UDE treatment suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue-level oxidative stress and safeguarded mitochondrial integrity from free radical-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, UDE played a direct role in restoring cellular redox homeostasis and reducing the inflammatory response by suppressing NF-κB, IL-1β, IL-18, caspase-1 expression, and ROS formation. Further, a plausible mechanism of action of UDE against S protein-induced damage was proposed. Conclusions: This study described a novel therapeutic approach against S protein-mediated hyperinflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative damage. Hence, UDE may be considered as a prospective alternative to combat life-threatening consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is highly contagious; the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease a global public health emergency due to the current outbreak. Even though the virus of COVID-19 has a resemblance to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, the infection is somewhat different. The first signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are not specific. It has a broad spectrum of clinical signs that remain to be determined. Various testing protocols have been published by the WHO for testing COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission is considered the primary route for the spreading of disease. Several efforts have been started all around the world to develop vaccines against the COVID-19 virus. Currently, various drugs and different diagnostic kits are being used to test for the COVID-19 infection. Based on earlier pieces of evidence, we systematically discuss the epidemiological study of SARS-CoV-2 with characteristics, symptoms, diagnosis and vaccine development, and preventive measures of the COVID-19 epidemic.">

 Introduction:
 SARS-CoV-2 causes various neurological sequelae in COVID-19 survivors including fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19 illness, is also a major risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Clinical evidence suggests that reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a likely pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and eNOS levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD . We hypothesize that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) deficiency contributes to brain endothelial dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and that SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerates the onset of VaD in eNOS-deficient mice.


 Methods:
 6-month-old eNOS+/- (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and WT male mice were infected with 1X10
 4
 -pfu mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2 intranasally, and animals were evaluated acutely out to 3-days-postinfection (3dpi) for changes in body weight and clinical signs of illness. Viral copy numbers and nuclear capsid were also quantified in lung and brain. Quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence were used to analyze markers of brain inflammation and senescence.


 Results:
 eNOS+/- infected mice exhibited more disease-associated weight loss (~15%) than WT-infected mice (~5 %). While infected WT and eNOS+/- had comparable pulmonary viral load, neither had detectable virus in the brain. Quantitative PCR analysis of whole brain-isolated mRNA showed increases in multiple proinflammatory mediators such as CCL2 and IL-6 and senescence markers such as p53 and p21 (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT). Similarly, immunofluorescent analysis showed increased Iba1 (microglia marker) fluorescent intensity in the cortex of infected mice (eNOS
 +/-
 >> WT).


 Conclusions:
 eNOS+/- deficiency, a clinically relevant model of VaD, worsens acute SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity, neuroinflammation and markers of brain senescence despite comparable pulmonary viral load (to WT-infected animals) and absence of virus in the brain. While the potential effects of SARS-COV-2 on cognitive decline in this model will be assessed in future studies, this is the first experimental evidence demonstrating a link between eNOS and neuropathology associated with COVID-19.

        <tr id="Systemic inflammation is associated with COVID-19 mortality rates, but the impact of inflammation on neutralizing antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on outcomes is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the association between neutralizing antibody responses, inflammation, and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Two hundred and eight patients presenting to the ED with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were included. Neutralization was assessed using the architect angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) binding inhibition assay, and inflammation was assessed using C reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Medical records were examined for 30-day mortality and 10-day intubation. Correlation between biomarkers was assessed and Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for outcomes. Thirty-seven (18%) patients died and 59 (28%) required intubation. There was a correlation between IL-6 and CRP (r = 0.34) but not ACE-2 (r < 0.06). Patients that died had higher CRP (14 mg/dl, 8-21) than those that survived (5 mg/dl, 2-11) and IL-6 (died = 344 pg/ml, 138-870 vs. survived = 65 pg/ml, 28-140). ACE-2 inhibition trended higher in those who survived (18%, 0%-65%) than those who died (3%, 0%-48%). Patients with elevated IL-6, elevated CRP, or low ACE2 inhibition had higher mortality. Only IL-6 (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.52) and age (1.04, 1.01-1.08) were associated with mortality in multivariate models. Elevated IL-6 was associated with 30-day mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lower ACE-2 inhibition was not independently associated with mortality or correlated with inflammatory markers, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.IMPORTANCEWhile systemic inflammation associated with worse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not associated with neutralizing antibody concentrations, implying the importance of other aspects of the immune response for reducing SARS-CoV-2 mortality risk.">

        <tr id="The coinfection of individual cells is a requirement for exchange between two or more virus genomes, which is a major mechanism driving virus evolution. Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.">

        <tr id="Despite the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, there still remain risks of new aggressive strains of coronavirus. As the human population increases progressively, it is mandatory to ensure both preventive measures and an immediate response to emerging infectious threats. Another essential component for rapidly restraining a new possible pandemic is the development of new anticoronaviral therapeutics. In the present study, the anticoronaviral capabilities of Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF) are characterized. It is demonstrated that the administration of GcMAF to Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the first phase of infection (six days postinfection) is accompanied by (i) a statistically significant reduction in the viral load of the lung tissue and (ii) the switching of the inflammatory status of the lung tissue to a neutral one in terms of mRNA expression levels of the groups of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The potential mechanism for this antiviral action and the containment of the inflammatory response by the drug associated with the engagement of terminal N-acetylgalactosamine GcMAF and C-type lectin domain containing 10A expressed at the surface of lung-infiltrating macrophages and pneumocytes, which simultaneously express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is discussed.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cells are associated with viral clearance and improved outcomes in COVID-19, but also with immunopathology. Defining T cell diversity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables implementation of T cells in prevention and treatment strategies. T cells recognize peptide sequences from pathogens upon presentation in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Human MHC molecule diversity results in a wide array of peptide recognition by T cells making viral escape difficult, but also challenging to measure. Methods Using the ImmunoSEQ Assay to sequence complementarity-determining regions in the β chains (CDR3β) of the T cell receptor (TCR) from peripheral blood collected from participants in the EPICC COVID-19 cohort study, we quantified and characterized patterns of TCR usage. Multiple bioinformatic pipelines were compared for analysis. Results Our study evaluated TCR repertoires from 39 participants who had mild (20 outpatient) versus severe (19 hospitalized) acute COVID-19, and either experienced unvaccinated primary infection (n = 15) or vaccine breakthrough infection (n = 24) (Table 1). From these four clinical groups, we used the ImmuneCODE database, VDJdatabase and healthy controls to identify CD8 TCR sequences and amino acid motifs in the CDR3β region specific for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We were surprised to find that vaccine breakthrough and primary infection participants exhibited similar frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR sequences over 14-21 days post-symptom onset. Increased use of common TCR clones occurred in participants with older age and comorbidities, which correlated with more severe disease (Figure 1). Strikingly, an increased frequency of non-SARS-CoV-2 TCRs was significantly associated with severe disease in unvaccinated (p = 0.006) and vaccinated participants (p = 0.045). Conclusion In conclusion, our study highlights the opportunities and challenges of studying the complexity of T cell diversity and the utility of combining databases and bioinformatics for identification of patterns of TCR recognition. Interestingly, participants who were hospitalized were more likely to have circulating T cells non-specific for SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that vaccines that increase T cell specificity may reduce disease severity.

Viruses dominate the WHO's current ranking of the top 10 global health hazards, especially RNA viruses. RNA viruses, like HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza, which are among the most prevalent and frequently encountered RNA viruses, use RNA as their genetic material, making them prone to quick changes. They adapt rapidly, complicating the body's immune responses. HIV, a significant retrovirus, infiltrates the immune system, causing AIDS by compromising defenses against infections. SARS-CoV-2, which led to COVID-19, sparked a worldwide pandemic with respiratory symptoms, emphasizing the need for research and therapeutic innovations. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the insufficiency of available resources in effectively addressing emerging viral infections. Influenza, a seasonal RNA virus, triggers flu outbreaks, impacting public health. Research is crucial to understanding how these viruses interact with hosts, aiding the development of effective treatments and strengthening our ability to face new viral threats. The most effective defenses against viral illnesses are virus-specific vaccinations and antiviral drugs. The present review emphasizes the prevalence of the three most pathogenic and widespread RNA viruses, namely HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV2, their pathophysiology, and the current treatment with FDA-approved drugs. It also incorporates novel analogs that are under clinical trials as there is an urgent need for innovative antiviral medications, and enormous global efforts are required to find secure and efficient cures for these viral infections.">

It is associated with severe outcomes and a higher risk of mortality. In January 2021, the vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in India and started mass administration of two types of vaccines. The two vaccines used on a large scale were, a recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine/ ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield) and whole virion inactivated vaccine/ BBV152 (Covaxin).The study of cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination in PLWH was vital for safeguarding this vulnerable population. Methods Study design: Prospective observational study Study population: The individuals recruited in the study were vaccinated with at least 2 doses and/or booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (COVISHIELD/COVAXIN). The individuals were segregated into two groups (PLWH and non-HIV-infected healthy individuals). Testing Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were cultured to test the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune response using activation induced marker/ intracellular cytokine staining (AIM/ICS) assay. Distribution of CD4 T lymphocytes count in HIV patients with mean CD4 count 470 cell/µl. Results We conducted did this study in two phases. The first phase was conducted between August 2022 and December 2022, while the second phase, or the follow-up, took place from January 2023 to December 2023. In the first phase/ first visit (V1), we recruited 50 adult PLWH and 40 adult healthy controls. Subsequently, in phase 2/follow-up/ second visit (V2), we achieved a follow-up rate of 100% in each arm. SARS-CoV2-specific cellular immune response after COVID-19 vaccination was comparable and durable IN PLWH as compared to healthy controls. Conclusion Comparable and durable immune response was observed in PLWH population on regular highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with stable viral suppression and good CD4+ T cell counts. This was consistent over time across 1 year gap in both phases of the study and across different vaccine types. This outcome indicates that the cellular immune responses in our PLWH cohort is comparable and durable to that of the general population, which is a reassuring finding for the public health.

Lung organoids have emerged as an alternative model that partially overcomes this key disadvantage. Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded dsRNA or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses. Our study informs the selection of culture conditions for organoid-based respiratory disease research and therapeutic testing. Importance The COVID-19 pandemic heralded the upsurge in human-derived lung organoid based studies due to their cellular heterogeneity that emulates the cellular complexity of the respiratory tract. A major disadvantage of organoid models resides in their apical-in conformation that “hides” cells and proteins that are typically exposed to the air-liquid interface (ALI) in the airways and are targets of viruses. Here, we generated monolayers and ALI cultures to facilitate cell exposure to highly relevant pathogens and compared them to parental organoids. Organoids at the ALI captured infection and immune responses better than organoids and organoid-derived monolayer cultures. Organoids at the ALI are a viable approach to improve identification and characterization of virus infection, host responses, and therapeutic testing.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, profoundly impacted global health systems and economies. Vaccination and diagnostic advancements were pivotal in managing the pandemic. This systematic review evaluates antibody levels in adults following complete COVID-19 vaccination and examines the prevalence of infections in vaccinated populations. A systematic review adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted, focusing on studies analyzing antibody levels at least 14 days after full vaccination with FDA- or EMA-approved vaccines. Five European studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. Data were extracted and synthesized from studies involving 6280 participants aged 19 to 105, with an average of 11% having prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Antibody levels were analyzed over time, and the incidence of post-vaccination COVID-19 cases was recorded. The reviewed studies demonstrated that antibody levels peaked shortly after vaccination but gradually declined over time. Individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited higher antibody titers than those without prior exposure. After the first dose, the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine led to significantly higher antibody levels than the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, especially in those without prior infection. Across all studies, the incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated individuals was low (0.1–3.8% for 144–302 days post-vaccination). Vaccination reduced severe outcomes despite decreasing antibody levels. The decline in new COVID-19 cases and related deaths is attributed to widespread vaccination, natural immunity, and virus mutations reducing severity. Further studies are warranted to explore antibody persistence and optimal vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a site of replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and GI symptoms are often reported by patients. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends upon heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which commensal bacteria that bathe the human mucosa are known to modify. To explore human gut HS-modifying bacterial abundances and how their presence may impact SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a task-based analysis of proteoglycan degradation on large-scale shotgun metagenomic data. We observed that gut bacteria with high predicted catabolic capacity for HS differ by age and sex, factors associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and directly by disease severity during/after infection, but do not vary between subjects with COVID-19 comorbidities or by diet. Gut commensal bacterial HS-modifying enzymes reduce spike protein binding and infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bacterial grooming of the GI mucosa may impact viral susceptibility.IMPORTANCESevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, can infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and individuals who exhibit GI symptoms often have more severe disease. The GI tract's glycocalyx, a component of the mucosa covering the large intestine, plays a key role in viral entry by binding SARS-CoV-2's spike protein via heparan sulfate (HS). Here, using metabolic task analysis of multiple large microbiome sequencing data sets of the human gut microbiome, we identify a key commensal human intestinal bacteria capable of grooming glycocalyx HS and modulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro. Moreover, we engineered the common probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection of human cell cultures. Understanding these microbial interactions could lead to better risk assessments and novel therapies targeting viral entry mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to more than 700 million confirmed cases and nearly 7 million deaths. Although Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus mainly infects the respiratory system, neurological complications are widely reported in both acute infection and long-COVID cases. Despite the success of vaccines and antiviral treatments, neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 remains an important question, which is also centered on the mystery whether the virus is capable of breaching the barriers into the central nervous system.Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model. (A) Experimental diagram: Eight weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, monitored daily for symptoms, or euthanized at 5 days post-infection (DPI) to collect tissue. (B) Daily weight measurements in K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020.

(D) Representative mouse brain hemisphere image showing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by immunohistochemical staining. Boxed regions are shown on the right. Bar: 500 µm. Methods Here using the K18-hACE2 model, we investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection on major parts of neurovascular systems, and found increased incidence of microhemorrhage and significant disruption of both BBB and BCSFB in K18-hACE2 mice after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cerebral microvascular injury was accompanied by substantial pericyte damage, tight junction loss, astrogliosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma. In addition, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation occurred at both BBB and BCSFB, as shown by upregulation of VCAM-1 and COX2 markers.Figure 2: Vascular damage and BBB breakdown in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 model.

Results By studying the K18-hACE2 infection model, we observed clear evidence of microvascular damage and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused pericyte damage, tight junction loss, endothelial activation and vascular inflammation, which together drive microvascular injury and BBB impairment.

Cellular senescence has been implicated as a key pathogenic mechanism. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of regorafenib, a previously characterized senomorphic drug, for severe COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 virus‐infected K18‐hACE2 mice, overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor, exhibited 100% mortality by 10 days post infection. Regorafenib treatment significantly improved survival rates, approximately 43% remaining alive. Mechanistically, regorafenib effectively suppressed type I and II interferon and cytokine signaling. Notably, regorafenib inhibited NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, a key driver of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID‐19. Our findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of regorafenib and suggest its potential use as a promising treatment option for severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Lung-resident immune cells, spanning both innate and adaptive compartments, preserve the integrity of the respiratory barrier, but become pathogenic if dysregulated1. Current in vitro organoid models aim to replicate interactions between the alveolar epithelium and immune cells but have not yet incorporated lung-specific immune cells critical for tissue residency2. Here we address this shortcoming by describing human lung alveolar immuno-organoids (LIO) that contain an autologous tissue-resident lymphoid compartment, primarily composed of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs). Additionally, we introduce lung alveolar immuno-organoids with myeloid cells (LIOM), which include both TRMs and a macrophage-rich alveolar myeloid compartment. The resident immune cells formed a stable immune-epithelial system, frequently interacting with the epithelium and promoting a regenerative alveolar transcriptomic profile. To understand how dysregulated inflammation perturbed the respiratory barrier, we simulated T-cell-mediated inflammation in LIOs and LIOMs and used single-cell transcriptomic analyses to uncover the molecular mechanisms driving immune responses. The presence of innate cells induced a shift in T cell identity from cytotoxic to immunosuppressive, reducing epithelial cell killing and inflammation. Based on insights obtained with bulk RNA-seq data from the phase 3 IMpower150 trial, we tested whether LIOM cultures could model clinically-relevant but poorly understood pulmonary side effects caused by immunotherapies such as the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab3. We observed a decrease in immunosuppressive T cells and identified gene signatures that matched the transcriptomic profile of patients with drug-induced pneumonitis. Given its effectiveness in capturing outcomes and mechanisms associated with a prevalent pulmonary disease, this system unlocks opportunities for studying a wide range of immune-related pathologies in the lung.">

However, existing studies have mainly focused on peripheral blood samples and barely identified specific metabolites that are critically involved in the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current small-scale study, we performed metabolic profiling in plasma (n = 61) and paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples (n = 20) using parallel two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS). In addition, we studied how an identified metabolite regulates the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. The results unveiled distinct metabolome changes between healthy donors, and moderate and severe patients in both plasma and BALF, indicating that locations and disease severity play critical roles in COVID-19 metabolic alteration. Notably, a vital metabolite, indoxyl sulfate, was found to be elevated in both the plasma and BALF of severe COVID-19 patients. Indoxyl sulfate selectively induced TNF-α production, reduced co-stimulatory signals, and enhanced apoptosis in human monocytes. Moreover, its levels negatively correlated with the strength of co-stimulatory signals and antigen presentation capability in monocytes of COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our findings suggest that the levels of indoxyl sulfate could potentially serve as a functional biomarker to monitor COVID-19 disease progression and guide more individualized treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: The T cell adaptive immune response is an important factor in the formation of antiviral defense against SARS-CoV-2. 
AIMS: Тo study T cell immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 in helthcare workers (HCWs) of a temporary infectious diseases hospital in Kazan - COVID-19 convalescents 2.5-3 years after the infection using the IGRA-ELISPOT technology – «TIGRA-Test SARS-CoV-2». 
METHODS: The immune response to the most immunogenic peptides S,N,ORF-3a, ORF-7a SARS-CoV-2 was studied in 91 HCWs of the city of Kazan 2.5 - 3 years after suffering from COVID-19 of varying severity and varying vaccine status. The results were recorded by the number of spots formed - imprints of one T cell secreting IFN-γ in response to antigenic stimulation. The number of spots obtained characterized the content of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens and made it possible to assess the individual immune response (IR). When statistically processing the data, descriptive statistics methods and the Wilcoxon matched data test were used. Differences were considered significant at p 0.05. 
RESULTS: 2.5 - 3 years after undergoing COVID-19, a T-cell immune response to S protein peptides is recorded in 71%, and to structural peptides N, M, ORF3a and ORF7a in 87% of medical workers. A higher level of T cell immunity to antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is observed in HCWs who have had moderate/severe COVID-19. n the asymptomatic form, the preservation of the T cell response to S-protein peptides and peptides N,M,ORF3a and ORF7a is comparable to a mild form of COVID-19. The preservation of the parameters of hybrid immunity compared to post-infectious immunity is higher, which is significant both for groups with a history of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and for the group with asymptomatic forms. 
CONCLUSIONS: Our empirically established ranking of the number of spots in classes can be used to assess individual cellular immunity and stratify the risks of re-infection in HCWs. A negative result of the T cell immune response to the spike S protein antigen may be the basis for deciding whether to re-vaccinate HCWs.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes pulmonary edema, which disrupts the lung alveoli–capillary barrier and leads to pulmonary cell apoptosis, the main cause of death. However, the molecular mechanism behind SARS-CoV-2’s apoptotic activity remains unknown. Here, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a mediates the pulmonary pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is demonstrated by the fact that it causes lung tissue damage. The in vitro results showed that SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a triggers cell death via the disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, which is modulated through the regulation of Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive Potassium Channel (MitoKATP). The addition of exogenous Potassium (K+) in the form of potassium chloride (KCl) attenuated mitochondrial apoptosis along with the inflammatory interferon response (IFN-β) triggered by SARS-ORF-3a. The addition of exogenous K+ strongly suggests that dysregulation of K+ ion channel function is the central mechanism underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction and stress response induced by SARS-CoV-2-ORF-3a. Our results designate that targeting the potassium channel or its interactions with ORF-3a may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate the damaging effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="In a subset of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals treated with the antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the virus rebounds following treatment. The mechanisms driving this rebound are not well understood. We used a mathematical model to describe the longitudinal viral load dynamics of 51 individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 20 of whom rebounded. Target cell preservation, either by a robust innate immune response or initiation of N-R near the time of symptom onset, coupled with incomplete viral clearance, appears to be the main factor leading to viral rebound. Moreover, the occurrence of viral rebound is likely influenced by the time of treatment initiation relative to the progression of the infection, with earlier treatments leading to a higher chance of rebound. A comparison with an untreated cohort suggests that early treatments with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be associated with a delay in the onset of an adaptive immune response. Nevertheless, our model demonstrates that extending the course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir treatment to a 10-day regimen may greatly diminish the chance of rebound in people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk of progression to severe disease. Altogether, our results suggest that in some individuals, a standard 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir starting around the time of symptom onset may not completely eliminate the virus. Thus, after treatment ends, the virus can rebound if an effective adaptive immune response has not fully developed. These findings on the role of target cell preservation and incomplete viral clearance also offer a possible explanation for viral rebounds following other antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2.


IMPORTANCE
Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In a subset of individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, the initial reduction in viral load is followed by viral rebound once treatment is stopped. We show that the timing of treatment initiation with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may influence the risk of viral rebound. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir stops viral growth and preserves target cells but may not lead to full clearance of the virus. Thus, once treatment ends, if an effective adaptive immune response has not adequately developed, the remaining virus can lead to rebound. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of rebound and can help develop better treatment strategies to minimize this possibility.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID-19, which stands for Coronavirus Disease 2019, is caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and primarily manifests as a respiratory disease. However, the literature has reported its influence upon brain structure [1] and this observation finds additional support in the brain injury indicator, neurofilament light chain (NFL) [2]. Our NFL analysis in COVID-infected patients has indicated a correlation with the disease’ s severity. Nevertheless, the exact pathological pathway leading to brain neuronal injury remains elusive. Aims & Objectives In our prior analyses, we presented the findings on the NFL levels and their association with the syndrome observed in COVID-19-infected patients. In this study, we extended our investigation to include the examination of the oxidative stress indicator, D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) [3], in order to assess its correlation with NFL and its potential significance in COVID-infected patients. Method Plasma samples from 400 COVID-19 patients, drawn from 24 hospitals across Taiwan and sourced from the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) Biobank, were utilized for the analysis of DAO via immunoassay. The NFL data was incorporated from our previous investigation. Statistical analyses encompassed the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing two groups, Spearman's correlation analysis for assessing bivariate correlations. To address the distribution in plasma DAO and NFL levels, we applied log-transformation before subjecting them to the general linear model, with age and gender adjustment. Results Among the 391 COVID-infected patients analyzed, the average plasma DAO level was 136 ng/ml. Notably, the 10 patients exhibiting the most severe brain injury (NFL levels above 200 pg/ml) had a significantly higher average plasma DAO level of 568.2 ng/ml, in contrast to the group with less severe brain injury (NFL levels less than 200 pg.ml) composed of 381 patients, who had an average DAO level of 124.7 ng/ml (P=0.002). The DAO level displayed a significant correlation with the NFL level (Spearman’ s r=0.31, P<0.0001). Both the average NFL and DAO levels were significantly higher in patients over 50 years of age (P<0.0001, respectively), indicating a significant age-related trend. Male patients showed higher NFL and DAO levels than females (P=0.0002, and P<0.0001, respectively). The elevation in plasma NFL and DAO levels was most pronounced within the first 1-7 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed, subsequently declining over the course of a month. Additionally, the correlation between DAO and NFL levels became more pronounced in patients age 50 and above (Spearman’ s r=0.37, P=0.0001) compared to those under 50 years of age (Spearman’ s r=0.237, P<0.0001). Furthermore, the DAO level exhibited strong correlations with renal function indicators, specifically creatinine (Spearman’ s r=0.30, P=0.0002), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (Spearman’ s r=0.23, P=0.008). Discussion & Conclusion COVID-19 infection may lead to brain neuronal injury, particularly among male patients aged 50 and above. This neuronal injury exhibited a significant correlation with oxidative stress, as indicated by DAO. Furthermore, higher plasma DAO levels were associated with impaired kidney function, as indicated by elevated creatinine and BUN levels in clinical assessments. These results imply the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathological processes underlying brain neuronal injury.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, often leading to long-term kidney dysfunction. However, the transcriptomic features of AKI severity and its long-term effects are underexplored.


METHODS
We performed bulk RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients and complemented these findings with proteomic data from the same cohort. We compared the functional enrichment findings with historical sepsis-AKI data and subsequently examined the association between molecular signatures and long-term kidney function changes.


RESULTS
In 283 patients, 57 had mild AKI (stage 1) and 49 had severe AKI (stage 2 or 3). Following adjustments for age, sex, severity of infection, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), we identified 6,432 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the severe AKI vs. control comparison, 840 in the mild AKI vs. control, and 1,213 in the severe vs. mild AKI comparison (FDR<0.05). Common pathways included unfolded protein response, cellular response to stress via eIF2, and IFN-g-mediated inflammatory response. Severe AKI was linked to pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Proteomic analysis confirmed 40 established AKI and inflammation biomarkers, while gene-set enrichment of transcription regulators revealed additional biomarkers for severe AKI. Comparison with PBMC transcriptomics from sepsis-related AKI showed significant functional overlap (30%). Analysis of post-discharge eGFR data in 115 patients identified 177 DEGs for severe vs. control, 106 for mild vs. control, and 46 for severe vs. mild AKI. Key associations included kidney function decline related to carbohydrate and mitochondrial metabolism, inflammatory-response, and cardiovascular regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that severe AKI in SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress. The functional overlap with sepsis-AKI suggests potential broader therapeutic applicability. Long-term kidney dysfunction is influenced by disruptions in cellular energy metabolism and immune response.">

        <tr id="Exacerbated inflammation is a major contributor to tissue damage and mortality in infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. The resolution phase of inflammation is critical for restoring tissue homeostasis following an injury. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a ubiquitous protein that plays a fundamental role in the resolution of inflammation, including in preclinical models of infectious disease. Here, we investigated the role of AnxA1 in coronavirus infection and its potential as a host-targeted therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. Wild-type (WT) and AnxA1 knockout (AnxA1KO) mice were intranasally infected with the murine betacoronavirus MHV-3 to study the endogenous role of AnxA1. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses in the lungs of MHV-3-infected mice revealed increased AnxA1 expression and its cleavage, which was associated with neutrophilic infiltration (Ly6G+ cells) mainly in peribronchiolar and perivascular regions. AnxA1-deficient mice exhibited higher neutrophilic infiltration and lung damage, alongside increased CXCL1 production in the lungs, when compared to WT-infected mice. In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice, we found increased AnxA1 cleavage associated with lung inflammation. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice with the AnxA1-mimetic peptide, Ac2-26, reduced lung damage and lethality, without altering the host ability to deal with viral replication. Notably, Ac2-26-treated mice exhibited similar levels of protection to that afforded by the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight the protective role of the endogenous AnxA1 in mitigating coronavirus-induced lung inflammation and underscore the therapeutic potential of AnxA1 mimetic Ac2-26 as a host-targeted therapy against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory tract and lungs; however, the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can also involve the central nervous system. The pathomechanisms underlying neurological impairments in COVID-19 and post COVID-19 condition remain incompletely understood, hence experimental studies under defined conditions, in a suitable animal model, can help to clarify the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. The K18-hACE2 mouse represents such a model, as intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 VOC generally results in widespread neuronal infection with limited tissue response in the brain, consistent with a mild non-suppurative (meningo)encephalitis, with microgliosis, astrogliosis and (peri)vascular leukocyte infiltrates but no evidence of infection of vessel structures. The present study used this model to address the hypothesis that the vascular reaction is secondary to the neuronal infection. It confirmed that in intranasally challenged K18-hACE2 mice the virus targeted the neurons without overt neuropathic effect, whilst sparing the blood vessels, and further characterised the resulting inflammatory response in the brain in situ and through bulk RNA sequencing. The former highlighted the recruitment of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) via postcapillary venules, with their accumulation in the perivascular space and occasional emigration into the neuroparenchyma, without targeting and/or damage to the vessel wall. At the transcriptome level, this was accompanied by positive enrichment of pathways and the upregulation of genes involved in both the inflammatory reaction and the recruitment (including adhesion and migration) and activity of the leukocytes. We also found morphological and molecular evidence of subtle impairment of blood-brain barrier function, i.e. increased permeability. The results obtained from the model indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the neurons induces neuroinflammation, with leukocyte recruitment and activation as well as blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These data can help to understand more fully the reaction of the CNS in COVID-19 patients, and neurotropic virus infections in general.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still poorly characterized. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 10 (TLR10) in modulating the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that overexpression of TLR10 in A549 lung epithelial cells, immunostimulated with SARS-CoV-2 proteins S and N mainly downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and interferons and affected gene expression in the cocultured THP-1 monocytes. Our results suggest that TLR10 could mediate the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection by downregulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL10, IL6, IL8, and IFNβ. Modulation of TLR10 expression could have implications for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, in whom excessive inflammation leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a key feature. However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of modulating TLR10 expression on the antiviral response and the overall balance of the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background/Aim Case reports describe prolonged COVID19 shedding in patients with malignant hematological disease. Similarly, we observed extended viral shedding in hemato-oncological patients (HP) at our SARS-CoV-2 unit. This raises the question of whether HP are more susceptible to prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and which aspects of immunosuppression contribute to this phenomenon. Patients and Methods Data from HP treated at a single center between 02/2022 and 02/2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Overall, 47 HP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test were included. Additional data on 16 HP were retrieved from literature. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (t[SARS+]) was compared between subgroups with different diagnoses, immune status, and HP with and without medical treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Results t[SARS+] of HP was 47 days [interquartile range (IR)=25-95] and 12 HP (19%) were still positive by the end of the follow-up. In our cohort, four HP died while still shedding SARS-CoV-2 [t[SARS+]=47 days (IR=33.5-86)]. Different oncological diagnoses did not influence t[SARS+]. HP under steroids had a significantly longer average t[SARS+] (108 days vs. 45 days; p=0.016). HP with B cell depletion/T cell depletion and leukopenia were found to require more time to test negative for SARS-CoV-2 (pLogrank <0.05). Vaccinated HP had a significantly shorter duration of viral shedding (vaccinated 35.5 days vs. not vaccinated 86 days; pLogrank <0.01). Conclusion Prolonged viral shedding is a common occurrence in HP. Our data illustrate that HP under immune suppression show a significantly longer t[SARS+]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vaccination influences the length of viral shedding.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection disturbs the coagulation balance in the blood, triggering thrombosis and contributing to organ failure. The role of prothrombotic metabolites in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains elusive. Leveraging K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we observed higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite, kynurenine, compared to controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant upregulation of enzymes controlling Kynurenine biogenesis, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase levels in kidneys and liver, respectively, as well as changes in the enzymes involved in kynurenine catabolism, including kynurenine monooxygenase and kynurinase. Consistent with the agonistic role of these metabolites in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling, AHR activation and its downstream mediator, tissue factor (TF), a highly potent procoagulant factor, was observed in endothelial cells (ECs) of lungs and kidneys of infected mice. These findings were validated in humans, where compared to controls, sera of COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of Kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid. Activation of the AHR-TF axis was noted in the kidneys and lungs of COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 sera showed higher IDO-1 activity than controls. Levels of Kyn in COVID-19 patients correlated strongly with the TF-inducing activity of COVID-19 sera on ECs. A specific IDO-1 inhibitor or AHR inhibitor separately or in combination suppressed COVID-19 sera-induced TF activity in ECs. Together, we identified IDO-1 as upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in augmented Kyn and its prothrombotic catabolites, thereby suggesting the Kyn-AHR-TF axis as possibly a new diagnostic and/or therapeutic target.

        <tr id="Here we investigated whether interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a key antiviral protein deficient in certain human populations, affects interspecies adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Beta and Omicron variants passaged through IFITM3-deficient versus wild type mice exhibit enhanced replication and pathogenesis in this new host species. Enhancements associated with amino acid substitutions in the viral genome, suggesting that IFITM3 limits accumulation of adaptive mutations. Mouse-adapted viruses enabled comparative studies of variants in mice. Beta caused lung dysfunction and altered cilia-associated gene programs, consistent with broad viral antigen distribution in lungs. Omicron, which shows low pathogenicity and upper respiratory tract preference in humans, replicated to high nasal titers while showing restrained spatial distribution in lungs and diminished lung inflammatory responses compared to Beta. Our findings demonstrate that IFITM3 deficiency accelerates coronavirus adaptation and reveal that intrinsic SARS-CoV-2 variant traits shape tropism, immunity, and pathogenesis across hosts.

 Background:
 Preceding respiratory tract infections (RTIs) caused by bacteria or viruses are associated with worse stroke outcomes, likely due to an exaggerated inflammatory immune response, endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, and coagulopathy. Recent studies have revealed increased plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity (the risk factors for stroke) in patients with RTIs, including COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis plays a causative role in the pathophysiology of
 S. aureus
 - or COVID-19-associated stroke severity or is merely an associative marker of disease status.


 Objective:
 To examine whether an imbalance in the VWF–ADAMTS13 axis is a causal link between RTIs and stroke severity.


 Methods:
 Wild-type (WT) mice (3–4 months old) were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of
 S. aureus
 (on days 0, 2, and 5) or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (on day 0). On day 6 (
 S. aureus
 ) or day 3 (SARS-CoV-2), the infection was confirmed to be localized in the lungs (but not in the brain) and the plasma VWF levels and ADTMTS13 activity were quantified. In another set of experiments, WT,
 Vwf
 −/−
 , and
 Adamts13
 −/−
 mice (3–4 months old) with respective littermate controls were subjected to transient (30 or 45 min) cerebral ischemia (filament stroke model) followed by reperfusion. For the
 S. aureus
 experiments, brain infarcts were assessed on day 2 post-reperfusion and functional outcomes (corner test, wire hanging test, modified neurological severity score, and rotarod test) on week 1 and 4 post-reperfusion. For the SARS-CoV-2 experiments, brain infarcts and functional outcomes (the Bederson score) were assessed on day 1 post-reperfusion.


 Result:
 We demonstrated that
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2 infection localized to the lungs in the WT mice resulted in increased (2–3 fold) plasma VWF levels and reduced ADAMTS13 activity, concomitant with larger infarcts and worse functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. mock-infected mice) up to day 28 post-reperfusion.
 S. aureus
 - or SARS-CoV-2-infected VWF-deficient mice exhibited reduced infarcts and improved functional outcomes (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Vwf
 +/+

 ). In contrast,
 S. aureus
 or SARS-CoV-2-infected ADAMTS13-deficient mice displayed greater stroke severity (P<0.05 vs. infected

 Adamts13
 +/+

 ).


 Conclusion:
 In the experimental models of RTI preceding stroke, VWF plays a causal role in worsening stroke outcomes, while ADAMTS13 is protective.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Complement hyperactivation and thrombotic microangiopathy are closely associated with severe COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction is a key mechanism underlying thrombotic microangiopathy. To address the relationship between endothelial injury, complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy of severe COVID-19, we wonder whether, and if so, what and how SARS-CoV-2 factors make endothelial cells (ECs) sensitive to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. We revealed that multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins enhanced complement-mediated cytotoxicity to ECs by inhibiting membrane complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) and enhancing the deposition of complement-recognizing component FCN1. By screening with CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA libraries, we identified that ADAMTS9, SYAP1, and HIGD1A as intrinsic regulators of CD59 on ECs, which were inhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 M, NSP16, and ORF9b proteins. IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and IFN-α upregulated CD55 and CD59, while IFN-γ antagonized the inhibition of CD59 by the three SARS-CoV-2 proteins. So, the deficiency of IFN-γ weakened the protection of ECs by CRPs against complement-mediated injury which may be enhanced during infection. Our findings illustrated the regulation of protection against complement-mediated attack on self-cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune responses, providing insights into endothelial injury, thrombotic microangiopathy, and potential targets for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Introduction Complex in vitro respiratory models, including air-liquid interface (ALI) transwell cultures and airway organoids, have emerged as promising tools for studying human respiratory virus infections. These models address several limitations of conventional two-dimensional cell line and animal models. However, the lack of standardized protocols for the application of these models in infection studies limits the possibilities for comparing results across different research groups. Therefore, we applied a collaborative approach to harmonize several aspects of experimental methodology between different research laboratories, aiming to assess the comparability of different models of human airway epithelium in the context of respiratory viral infections. Methods In this study, we compared three different models of human respiratory epithelium: a primary human bronchial epithelial cell-derived ALI transwell model, and two airway organoid models established from human airway- and lung-derived adult stem cells. We first assessed the presence of various differentiated cell types using immunofluorescence microscopy. Using a shared stock of influenza A virus, we then assessed viral growth kinetics, epithelial cytokine responses, and serum-mediated inhibition of infection. Results The presence of club, goblet, and ciliated cells was confirmed in all models. We observed similar viral replication kinetics with a >4-log increase in virus titre across all models using a TCID50 assay. Following infection, a reproducible antiviral cytokine response, including a consistent increase in CXCL10, IL-6, IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2/3, and IFN-β, was detected across all models. Finally, neutralization was assessed by pre-incubation of virus with human serum. Reduced viral replication was observed across all models, resulting in a 3- to 6-log decrease in virus titres as quantified by TCID50. Discussion In conclusion, all three models produced consistent results regardless of the varying cell sources, culturing approaches, and infection methods. Our collaborative efforts to harmonize infection experiments and compare ALI transwell and airway organoid models described here aid in advancing our understanding and improving the standardization of these complex in vitro respiratory models for future studies.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis strongly correlates with neuroinflammation. Peripheral monocytes are crucial components of the human immune system that may play a role in neuroinflammation, but their contribution to AD pathogenesis is largely understudied partially due to the lack of appropriate human models. Here, we present human cortical organoid microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) for modeling dynamic AD neuroinflammation mediated by monocytes. By incorporating 3D printed devices into an existing cortical organoid protocol, 96 hCO-MPSs can be established with significantly reduced necrosis and hypoxia as well as enhanced viability within a commonly used 96 well plate, and each hCO-MPS consists of a doughnut-shaped hCO and a 3D printed device per well. Using this approach, monocytes from AD patients exhibit higher infiltration, decreased amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance, and stronger inflammatory responses compared to monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis were observed to be induced by AD monocytes. Furthermore, the significant increase in the expression of IL1B and CCL3, both at the transcriptional and protein levels, indicated the pivotal role of these cytokine and chemokine in monocyte-mediated AD neuroinflammation. Our findings provide insight for understanding monocytes’ role in AD pathogenesis, and the user-friendly MPS models we present are compatible with existing laboratory settings, highlighting their potential for modeling neuroinflammation and developing new therapeutics for various neuroinflammatory diseases.">

While acute COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by examining the presence of the viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) genes, their mRNA expression, associated immunoglobulins (IgG), and immune regulation via IDO-2 activity in blood of individuals suspected of long COVID. Here we show that a unique patterns of test results contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, ultimately leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this condition. This study focuses on four key objectives: detecting viral or vaccin induced genetic material, quantifying mRNA expression of the N and S genes, profiling immunoglobulin levels, and measuring IDO-2 activity. These objectives aim to differentiate long COVID from other post-infectious conditions and provide insights into prolonged symptoms. The study population comprised 72 participants, 31 of whom were suspected of having long COVID based on defined symptomatology. Viral genetic material was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, Immunoglobulin levels varied, with symptomatic males exhibiting lower anti-Spike IgG levels than females, suggesting possible gender differences in immune response. Logistic regression models revealed that mRNA spike data alone in this small group was insufficient to predict symptoms presence, but the inclusion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers significantly improved predictive accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the complexity of long COVID and suggests that a multi-variable approach, combining mRNA and genomic spike data with inflammatory markers and demographic factors, provides a basis for effective prediction of symptoms, helping refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for long COVID">

We leveraged in vitro cell-based studies to investigate cardiomyocyte and macrophage interaction during CVB3 infection, as well as animal studies and unique human cardio specimens to evaluate mechanisms of viral heart injury. We present evidence that viral myocarditis is in part exacerbated by pathological activation of the complement pathway in cells, mice, and human cardiac tissues. We demonstrate unique cell type-specific responses to viral infection that are exacerbated by mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes and NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in macrophages. Macrophages are robustly activated by damage-associated mitochondrial components, including mitochondrial proteins and lipid extracts. Mechanistically, we identify complement protective factors CD59/protectin and CD55/DAF as novel targets of viral proteinase that acts to release the brakes on complement-mediated autoinjury. Collectively, our study highlights a novel mechanism that can act as a potential contributor to CVB3 pathogenesis through mitochondrial injury-mediated autoimmunity. IMPORTANCE This study sheds light on how enteroviruses, specifically coxsackievirus B3, may contribute to heart failure by triggering harmful immune responses in the heart. We discovered that viral infections in heart cells cause mitochondrial damage, which in turn activates a destructive immune response involving the complement system. This immune activation is one of the significant contributors that lead to further injury of heart tissues, worsening the damage caused by the virus. Additionally, we identified key protective molecules that are targeted and disrupted by the virus, allowing the immune system to attack the heart even more aggressively. Understanding these mechanisms may provide additional insights into how viral infections can lead to chronic heart conditions and suggests potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reduce heart damage in patients affected by viral myocarditis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background COVID‐19 has been associated with both respiratory (diaphragm) and non‐respiratory (limb) muscle atrophy. It is unclear if SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of skeletal muscle plays a role in these changes. This study sought to: 1) determine if cells comprising skeletal muscle tissue, particularly myofibres, express the molecular components required for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; 2) assess the capacity for direct SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and its impact on atrophy pathway genes in myogenic cells; and 3) in an animal model of COVID‐19, examine the relationship between viral infection of skeletal muscle and myofibre atrophy within the diaphragm and limb muscles. Methods We used in silico bioinformatics analysis of published human single cell RNA‐seq datasets, as well as direct qPCR examination of human myotubes and diaphragm biopsies, to assess expression of key genes involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 cellular entry. In Vitro, we determined the ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 to directly infect myogenic cells and employed qPCR to assess the impact on muscle atrophy pathway genes (ubiquitin‐proteasome, autophagy). In vivo, the diaphragm and quadriceps of Roborovski hamsters with SARS‐CoV‐2 respiratory infection were examined at day 3 post‐inoculation to evaluate the relationship between atrophy pathway and SARS‐CoV‐2 transcripts by qPCR, as well as histological measurements of myofibre morphology. Results Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as cooperating proteases (furin, cathepsins B and L), are expressed by myofibres. ACE2 expression was increased 5‐fold (p = 0.01) in the diaphragms of mechanically ventilated human subjects compared to controls. In Vitro, a time‐dependent increase of SARS‐CoV‐2 transcript levels was observed in myotubes directly exposed to the virus (p = 0.002). This was associated with downregulation of the ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (by 64%, p = 0.002) and the autophagy gene LC3B (by 31%, p = 0.009). In contrast, in vivo infection led to upregulation of MuRF1 in quadriceps (23‐fold, p = 0.0007) and autophagy genes in both quadriceps (5.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 7‐fold for p62, p = 0.0002) and diaphragm (2.2‐fold for Gabarapl1, p = 0.03; 2.3‐fold for p62, p = 0.057). In infected hamsters the diaphragm lacked viral transcripts but exhibited atrophy (48% decrease in myofibre area; p = 0.02), whereas the quadriceps lacked myofibre atrophy despite elevated viral transcripts in the muscle. Conclusions Although myogenic cells express the genes required for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and can be directly infected, there was no evident relationship between viral transcript levels and manifestations of atrophy, either in vitro or in vivo. Our results do not support direct myofibre infection by SARS‐CoV‐2 as a likely cause of atrophy in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background: This study assessed the long-term dynamics of neutralizing antibodies in a Ugandan cohort primarily exposed to the A.23.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant, examining how this shaped immune breadth and potency against diverse strains following infection and prototype-based vaccination. Methods: We conducted a 427-day retrospective analysis of 41 participants across multiple SARS-CoV-2 waves, assessing binding and neutralizing antibody responses using in-house ELISA and pseudotyped virus neutralization assays. We quantified immune responses to key SARS-CoV-2 variants, A.23.1, D614G, Delta, and BA.4, capturing evolving immunity across the pandemic. Results: Neutralizing antibody titers against A.23.1 remained significantly higher than those against D614G, Delta, and BA.4, highlighting the solid immune memory following A.23.1 infection. Consistently lower titers were observed for BA.4 across all time points, aligning with its strong immune-evasion capability. Correlations between neutralizing titers and spike-directed IgG (S-IgG) concentrations were significantly stronger for A.23.1 than for D614G, with no correlation for BA.4. ChAdOx1-S vaccination substantially elevated the neutralizing titers across all variants, most notably BA.4, highlighting the essential role of vaccination in boosting immunity, even in individuals with initially low titers. Conclusions: Initial exposure to the A.23.1 variant triggered potent immune responses, shaping neutralizing antibody dynamics during subsequent exposures. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for early viral exposures in vaccine development and public health planning. The distinctly lower immune response to BA.4 highlights the need for continuous antigenic monitoring and timely vaccine updates for protection against emerging variants. Vaccination remains essential for reinforcing and sustaining immunity against evolving variants.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses can cause severe infections, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, often leading to hospitalization or death. Due to their ease of transmission, they are also scrutinized for their pandemic potential. No broad-spectrum antiviral is currently available. However most respiratory viruses use sialic acid or heparan sulfates as attachment receptors. Here, we report the identification of a pan-respiratory antiviral strategy based on mimicking both glycans. We synthesized and characterized a unique modified cyclodextrin that simultaneously mimics heparan sulfate and sialic acid. This novel compound demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity against important human pathogens: parainfluenza virus 3, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus H1N1, SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the compound is active against different avian strains of influenza virus, revealing its importance for pandemic preparedness. The compound retains broad- spectrum activity in ex vivo models of respiratory tissues and in vivo experiments against RSV and Influenza virus, using both prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. These findings represent a significant step forward in the development of future treatments and preventive measures for respiratory viral infections. Significance Statement Following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Influenza A H5N1 has become widespread in poultry and has already begun to spill over into mammals, posing a potential risk for the next pandemic. Indeed, respiratory viruses represent a major threat for future global health crises. Unfortunately, there is a significant lack of broad-spectrum antivirals available for such scenarios. To address this gap, our study developed a single molecule with the capacity to inhibit a wide range of clinically relevant human respiratory viruses including avian strains of influenza virus. This antiviral demonstrated verified efficacy not only in cellular systems but also in human-derived respiratory tissues and animal models.">

        <tr id="T-cell-mediated immunity is essential for controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection, preventing severe disease, and potentially reducing the risk of long-term coronavirus disease (COVID). This study investigated the impact of natural infection, vaccination, and hybrid immunity on T-cell responses, with a particular emphasis on the role of memory T-cells in long-term COVID-19. The present study reviewed current literature on T-cell responses, including memory T-cell development, in individuals with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, those vaccinated with messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and those with hybrid immunity. It examined studies that compared T-cell activity, immune regulation, and the prevalence of long-term COVID-19 across these groups. Natural infection induces variable T-cell responses, with severe cases showing stronger but sometimes dysregulated immunological activity, which may contribute to prolonged COVID-19. Vaccination, particularly with mRNA vaccines, elicits targeted and consistent T-cell responses, including memory T-cells, reducing disease severity, and the incidence of long-term COVID-19. Hybrid immunity combines natural infection and vaccination, provides the most robust protection, enhanceds memory T-cell responses, and reduces the risk of long-term COVID-19 through balanced immune regulation. Memory T-cells play a critical role in mitigating long-term COVID-19. Vaccination significantly enhances T-cell-mediated immunity, minimizing the risk of chronic symptoms compared to natural infection alone. Hybrid immunity provides the most effective defense, emphasizing the importance of vaccination, even after natural infection, to prevent long-term COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="Introduction Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality, especially in COVID-19 patients, due to delayed diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. While the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) in COVID-19 and sepsis are complex, understanding the molecular markers involved in these processes may aid in assessing disease severity. This study aimed to investigate the roles of PCD markers, inflammatory cytokines, and MHC molecules in distinguishing disease severity in COVID-19 patients with and without sepsis. Methods The study involved adult patients (≥18 years) who survived COVID-19, grouped into four cohorts: COVID-19 with sepsis (C19wSepsis), COVID-19 without sepsis (C19NoSepsis), sepsis alone, and healthy controls. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each cohort were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. PCD markers (caspase-3, caspase-1, MLKL, LC3B, p62/SQSTM1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma), and MHC molecules (MHC I-A, MHC II-DRB1) were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate differences in marker levels between and within cohorts. Results The analysis identified two distinct molecular signatures associated with disease severity. The first signature, characterized by elevated levels of secreted markers of PCD, IL-1-beta, IFN-gamma, MHC I-A and MHC II-DRB1, was common to the C19wSepsis and C19NoSepsis cohorts. The second signature, which was more prominent in the cellular markers of PCD (caspase-1, caspase-3, MLKL, p62/SQSTM1), was uniquely associated with the C19wSepsis cohort. Conclusion These findings provide insight into the molecular signatures distinguishing immune responses in COVID-19-related sepsis and may serve as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, while guiding therapeutic interventions in critical care settings.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT MAIT cells are one of the largest unconventional T cell populations and, recruited to the site of infection, play both protective and pathogenic roles during pulmonary viral infections. MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

Recent studies have reported that severe cases of COVID-19 are primarily characterized
by endotheliitis (or endothelialitis), whose severity is related to the pre-existing or current damage to
the complex structure that lines the surface of the vascular endothelium, most notably the glycocalyx.
Such damage results in the loss of many endothelial cell functions. To restore these functions, the
cell must repair the glycocalyx that covers it. However, this is not always possible, especially when
the repair capacity of such an exo-endo-cytoplasmic cell structure is limited due to cellular senescence.
If the gene repair system remains activated, the damaged glycocalyx can be reconstituted via
specific transcriptional pathways in response to oxidative and reductive stresses. Despite the experimental
evidence in favour of this hypothesis, many of the recently published reviewrs on long
COVID do not mention the use of therapeutic treatments via specific 'oxidative eustress'. In fact,
mild and controlled oxidative stress is able to induce an activating response to cellular damage repair
processes. This perspective aims to draw the attention of researchers to these aspects in an attempt to
address this gap in understanding.

        <tr id="The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic made it critical to understand the immune and inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It became increasingly recognized that the immune response was a key mediator of illness severity and that its mechanisms needed to be better understood. Early infection of both tissue and immune cells, such as macrophages, leading to pyroptosis-mediated inflammasome production in an organ system critical for systemic oxygenation likely plays a central role in the morbidity wrought by SARS-CoV-2. Delayed transcription of Type I and Type III interferons by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to early disinhibition of viral replication. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), some of which may be produced through mechanisms involving nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), likely contribute to the hyperinflammatory state in patients with severe COVID-19. Lymphopenia, more apparent among natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells, can contribute to disease severity and may reflect direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 or end-organ sequestration. Direct infection and immune activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 may be a critical mechanism through which end-organ systems are impacted. In this context, endovascular neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and microthrombi development can be seen in the lungs and other critical organs throughout the body, such as the heart, gut, and brain. The kidney may be among the most impacted extrapulmonary organ by SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to a high concentration of ACE2 and exposure to systemic SARS-CoV-2. In the kidney, acute tubular injury, early myofibroblast activation, and collapsing glomerulopathy in select populations likely account for COVID-19-related AKI and CKD development. The development of COVID-19-associated nephropathy (COVAN), in particular, may be mediated through IL-6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, suggesting a direct connection between the COVID-19-related immune response and the development of chronic disease. Chronic manifestations of COVID-19 also include systemic conditions like Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and Adults (MIS-A) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which may reflect a spectrum of clinical presentations of persistent immune dysregulation. The lessons learned and those undergoing continued study likely have broad implications for understanding viral infections’ immunologic and inflammatory consequences beyond coronaviruses.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic and devastating health crisis. Coronavirus (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), and the exaggerated immune response resulting from infection with this disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  Activation may have a contribution to disease severity.A case study was carried out in order to find the association between COVID-19, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2. The effect of age, sex, smoking, diabetic and hypertention on the level of the studied cytokines were evaluated. Inaddition, the influnce of COVID-19 severity on TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-2 levels were studied. Blood samples were collected from 50 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients who visited of Al-Hussein Teaching hospital and 50 control people, during the period from (May -November 2021). The ages of the patients ranged from (Twenty two years to seventy six years). The serum samples were used in detection of TNF-α , IL-8 and IL-2  by using ELISA test. Then   the collected data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 11. The results showed that that the most affected age group was (40-60) years old followed by less than 40 years old and more than 60 years old. The numbers of patients were 29, 11 and 10 respectively. Most of COVID-19 patients were male (56 %:28), while the rest cases were females (44%:22). The mean values of the studied cytokines in COVID-19 patients in both sex and all age groups were more than their counter parters in H.C group. The effect of main risk factors for severe and long COVID-19 include age, sex, smoking, presence of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension) on variations in the level of studied cytokines of the host were found significantly. Moreover, the effect of COVID-19 severity on the studied cytokines was highly significants. The maximum values of cytokines were obtaind in critical degree followed by severe and moderate severity.  It is concluded from the study's results that patients infected with severe SARS-CoV-2 experience increasing proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2 and interleukin-8 that produce signaling the initial phase of cytokine storm. Thus, further studies should be conducted to use the studied cytokines inhibitors as a treatment for COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The pathophysiology of viral diseases is complex, and often evokes strong inflammatory responses and tissue damage. Currently available in vitro models mainly recapitulate the viral life cycle per se, but fail to model immune cell-mediated pathogenesis. Here we build macrophage-augmented organoids (MaugOs) by integrating macrophages into organoids that are cultured from human liver tissues. We test the infections of two RNA viruses, hepatitis E virus (HEV) and SARS-CoV-2, and one DNA virus, monkeypox virus (MPXV), which either primarily or secondarily affect the human liver. In all three viral disease modalities, MaugOs recapitulate both infection and the resulting inflammatory response, albert to different levels. Intriguingly, this system showcases the ability to dissect the multifunctional role of human bile on HEV replication and inflammatory response through distinct mechanisms of action. MaugOs especially when integrated with pro-inflammatory macrophages recapitulate a prominent feature of inflammatory cell death triggered by HEV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept in MaugOs to develop multitarget therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target the virus, inflammatory response, and the resultant inflammatory cell death.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies guidelines recommend the use of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for patients with SARS-CoV-2 at high risk of disease progression, including those who are immunocompromised. We hypothesized that conventional plasma units have comparable neutralizing antibody levels to CCP.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
Conventional plasma and CCP units were obtained from blood suppliers. Quantitatively measured antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were assessed using the MesoScale Discovery multiplex electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Binding antibody distributions were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were analyzed using the GeneScript ELISA-based neutralization assay. The proportion of conventional and CCP units with a percent signal inhibition of ≥80% (as defined by the United States Food and Drug Administration for CCP in 2021) and exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.


RESULTS
Among 218 conventional plasma units and 74 CCP units collected between September 2023 and July 2024, the distribution of total antibody binding levels largely overlapped between conventional plasma and CCP, though statistically significant differences in median nucleocapsid and spike Omicron variant concentrations were observed. Median percent signal neutralization was 97.5% (range 3.4%-98.6%) among conventional plasma units and 97.7% (range 95.4%-98.6%) among CCP units. For conventional plasma, 95.0% (95% CI = 91.2%-97.5%) met the neutralization antibody threshold for high-titer CCP. For CCP, 100% (95% CI = 95.1%-100.0%) met the neutralization threshold for high-titer CCP.


CONCLUSION
Conventional plasma units demonstrate similar median antibody concentration to CCP units. In countries or regions where licensed CCP is unavailable and titers are unknown, transfusion of multiple conventional plasma units may be of clinical utility.">

        <tr id="In biomedical infectious disease research new models to bridge preclinical and clinical research are needed. Mouse models are still one of the most-interrogated experimental systems with the caveat of biological differences in pathogen-host-interaction for some human-relevant pathogens and increasing ethical concerns. Arguably one of the most complex cell culture models are precision cut organ slices, volume defined tissue blocks which can be cultured ex vivo and exposed to various stimuli including human pathogens. They could be applied as 3R model system. However, their response to infectious agents in comparison to in vivo models is understudied. To understand species and model specific differences in the host response (here: influenza A virus (IAV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn)), we interrogate here the transcriptional reaction of human PCLS (hPCLS) compared to that of murine precision cut lung slices (mPCLS) and a murine in vivo infection model. A direct comparison of hPCLS and mPCLS revealed a more complex early innate immune response against viral and bacterial pathogens in the human model, which beyond this informs about secondary cell-to-cell communication in situ and bystander cell responses to proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines secreted by tissue resident immune cells. In contrast, the murine PCLS model revealed substantial deficits in responding to viral challenge, reproducing only a small fraction of the murine in vivo host response. Our study provides the first cross-species comparison of early transcriptomic responses to relevant human pathogens.">

        <tr id="Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe condition often seen in intensive care unit patients. Due to limited treatment options, ALI is linked to high rates of mortality and morbidity. Bacterial and viral infections are significant contributors to ALI. For instance, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to a strong inflammatory response that may progress to ALI, a leading cause of death in COVID-19 cases. Prior research has demonstrated that sulfonamides and sydnones exhibit anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, which has led us to develop compounds containing both scaffolds. Most of the new sulfonamide-sydnone hybrids are expected to be orally bioavailable based on in silico ADME predictions. They effectively suppressed the development of ALI in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice and inhibited viral replication in Calu-3 cells, with minimal cytotoxicity in non-infected Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells. Molecular docking investigations indicated some possible viral targets for the action of the sydnones, highlighting the possible interaction with non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, combined experimental and theoretical studies indicated that the new compounds can strongly interact with human serum albumin, suggesting a possible extended residence time in the human bloodstream.">

        <tr id="Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) causes most Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC). The virus is one of the few known human tumor viruses, and due to its direct role in this skin cancer development, it is a bona fide model for viral tumorigenesis and tumorigenesis in general. Chronic viruses in humans such as MCPyV are highly adapted to their host and current models to study infection, persistence and pathogenesis are highly limited. We here use an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hair-bearing skin organoid (SkO) system to demonstrate efficient viral infection, progression and spread of MCPyV. Using bulk-, single cell - and spatial-transcriptomics, combined with immunostaining and nucleic acid hybridization technologies, we show that MCPyV ensures persistence due to a quasi-latency state within the majority of dermal fibroblasts carry the viral genome. Further, we identify the cell type of productive infection with papillary fibroblasts and dermal sheath fibroblasts supporting viral replication and progeny production. Our high-resolution methods demonstrate that the virus in these cells evades the innate immune response, as evidenced by the efficacy of interferon-beta treatment or ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, in suppressing or stimulating viral replication. We show that iPSC-derived SkOs are able to support infection and long-term persistence of the virus under conditions very similar to those found in humans. Thus, this infection model provides a robust platform for understanding and characterizing the interaction of this virus with the immune system in infection, testing treatment strategies to control reactivation and map processes involved in tumor development.">

        <tr id="Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of treatment options have been evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials, with several being approved for use in humans. Immunomodulatory drugs have shown success in dampening the deleterious inflammatory response seen in severe COVID-19 patients, but there remains an urgent need for development of additional therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. A potential drug target is the CCR5-CCL5 axis, and blocking this pathway may protect against severe disease. Here we evaluated whether OB-002, an analog of human CCL5 and a potent antagonist of CCR5, provides therapeutic benefit in SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters. Daily treatment with OB-002 altered immune gene transcription in the lungs, and reduced pathology following infection, but did not prevent weight loss or viral replication in the lungs of infected animals, even in combination with the antiviral drug remdesivir. Our data suggest that targeting the CCR5-CCL5 pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters is insufficient to significantly impact disease development in this model.">

Using transcriptional profiles we analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV2 infection and/or vaccination in pregnant people and their infants longitudinally Transcriptome changes in pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination Modular analysis of pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination compared with healthy uninfected controls. Red dot: overexpression, blue dot: underexpression, white/empty space no difference vs controls Methods Multicenter observational study of SARS-CoV-2-infected and/or vaccinated pregnant people and their infants. Pregnant people (infected [n=91], vaccinated [n=42], infected-and-vaccinated [n=14], controls [n=22]) and their infants (n=81, 38,14, 11, respectively) were included. Maternal blood samples were collected during different trimesters and at delivery. Infant blood samples were collected longitudinally from birth (< 72 hours), at 1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months of age. Whole blood RNA was extracted for RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic data analyzed with R Transcriptional analysis of immune system development in early life Modular gene expression scores were analyzed longitudinally of individual infant samples. Red: higher expression, white: lower expression. D1-3: days 1 to 3, W1: week 1, M1: month 1, M3: month 3, M6: month 6 Results Compared with uninfected controls, interferon and plasma cells genes were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute infection (< 14 days), but underexpressed with earlier infection or vaccination during pregnancy (Figure 1). Newborns < 72 h of age (from all groups) showed significantly increased expression of erythrocytes, neutrophils, and inflammation genes. Expression of T/cytotoxic cell genes started to be observed at 1 week, while expression of B cells, plasma cells and interferon genes was observed at 3 months of age (Figure 2). Quantitative gene set enrichment analysis showed that compared to controls, infants from infected and/or vaccinated mothers had increased expression of interferon, while neutrophil, and adaptive immunity genes were decreased (Figure 3) SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination of pregnant people shaped immune profiles of their infants Fold changes of gene sets in infants compared to controls are shown (adjusted p-value <0.01) from quantitative gene set enrichment (QuSAGE) analysis. Red: overexpression, blue: underexpression. Infant groups are defined by maternal infection and/or vaccination status at delivery. Conclusion Interferon and plasma cells related pathways were overexpressed in pregnant people with acute COVID-19, while vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection earlier in pregnancy were associated with under-expression of both innate and adaptive immunity genes. The infant immune system changed rapidly in the first few days of life, as different immune programs followed separate time trajectories.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019, was caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is a shell virus containing a single positive chain genome and using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The targeting of SARS-CoV-2 on several tissues expressing ACE2 explains the multifactorial pattern of symptoms: fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue and shortness of breath. These symptoms do not always stop after COVID-19, and symptoms may reappear within 12 weeks, which indicates the development of post-COVID syndrome (long COVID). Due to the extensive symptoms and comorbidity of patients, the clinical diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome is difficult. The aim of the study is to identify pathognomonic indices of biochemical blood analysis in convalescents, indicating the development of post-COVID syndrome. 
Patients and study design: a retrospective observational one-moment study of 373 case histories and outpatient records was conducted for the patients exposed to COVID-19 not later than 12 weeks ago. The initial course of the disease (disease) was assessed using the WHO Clinical Progression Scale. The severity of post-COVID syndrome (clinical outcomes) was assessed on the functional status scale after COVID-19 (PCFS). All subjects are divided into four groups, the names of which reflect the severity of COVID-19 and the severity of the post-ovoid condition: 1st group, “mild COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 2nd group, “mild COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”; 3rd group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 0-2 PCFS class”; 4th group, “medium and severe COVID-19 / 3-4 PCFS class”. The sample was described by calculating the median (Me) values and interquartile range expressed as Q1 and Q3 (Q0.25-Q0.75). The reliability of the differences between independent samples was assessed with nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test and the Student’s t-test. 
Upon evaluation of clinical blood biochemistry, the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in group 1 was higher than in groups 2 and 4, the aspartate aminotrasferase (AST) level in group 2 was higher than in groups 1 and 3. The indexes of total cholesterol and LDL did not show statistically significant differences between the groups. Creatinine levels in group 3 are higher than in group 1, being lower in group 4 than in other groups. Significant differences were observed upon qualitative assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP). There were 2-3 times more subjects with elevated CRP levels in groups 2 and 4 than in group 1. 
A minimal biochemical profile, including an assessment of the level of transaminases and creatinine, a qualitative or quantitative assessment of C-reactive protein, may indicate development of chronic inflammation. Patients of this group need to undergo an additional examination, e.g., general urine analysis and determination of albumin level in urine, dynamic GFR calculation, in order to prevent the development of persistent renal impairment.">

        <tr id="Human milk-derived extracellular vesicles (HMEVs) are key components in breast milk, promoting infant health and development. Maternal conditions could affect HMEV cargo; however, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HMEVs remains unknown. This study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on postpartum HMEV molecules. The median duration from SARS-CoV-2 test positivity to milk collection was 3 months. After defatting and casein micelle disaggregation, HMEVs were isolated from milk samples of nine mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 and six controls by sequential centrifugation, ultrafiltration, and qEV-size exclusion chromatography. The presence of HMEV was confirmed via transmission electron microscopy. Nanoparticle tracking analysis demonstrated particle diameters of <200 nm and yields of >1 × 1011 particles per mL of milk. Western immunoblots detected ALIX, CD9, and HSP70, supporting the presence of HMEVs in the isolates. Cargo from thousands of HMEVs were analyzed using a multi-omics approach, including proteomics and microRNA sequencing, and predicted that mothers with prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection produced HMEVs with enhanced functionalities involving metabolic reprogramming, mucosal tissue development, and immunomodulation. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy boosts mucosal site-specific functions of HMEVs, potentially protecting infants against viral infections.

        <tr id="We have previously shown that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) E1E2 envelope glycoprotein can regulate HIV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) activity through disruption to NF-κB activation. This response is associated with upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S, M, and E but not the N structural protein can perform similar downmodulation of HIV-1 LTR activation, and in a dose-dependent manner, in both HEK293 and lung BEAS-2B cell lines. This effect is highest with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S strain and decreases over time for the subsequent emerging variants of concern (VOC), with Omicron providing the weakest effect. We developed pseudo-typed viral particle (PVP) viral tools that allowed for the generation of cell lines constitutively expressing the four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins and utilising the VSV-g envelope protein to deliver the integrated gene construct. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) was performed on cells expressing S, E, M, or N to determine cell activation status. Gene expression differences were found in a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IF16, IFIT1, IFIT2, and ISG15, as well as for a number of heat shock protein (HSP) genes, including HSPH1, HSPA6, and HSPBP1, with all four SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. There were also differences observed in expression patterns of transcription factors, with both SP1 and MAVS upregulated in the presence of S, M, and E but not the N protein. Collectively, the results indicate that gene expression patterns associated with ER stress pathways can be activated by SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein expression. The results suggest the SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate an array of cell pathways, resulting in disruption to NF-κB signalling, hence providing alterations to multiple physiological responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.">

The patients failed to develop seroconversion of IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. However, they showed favorable clinical outcomes after treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or molnupiravir, despite the antiviral therapies being initiated later in the clinical course. Our case highlights that in immunocompromised hosts, viral clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in lung tissue may lag behind that in the upper respiratory tract.

        <tr id="Abstract Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we observed that patients received anti-CD20 therapy progressed to severe pneumonia and underwent persistent viral shedding. We aimed to identify the association between anti-CD20 therapy and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as the outcomes of COVID-19. Methods Using claims data derived from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, we conducted a matched nationwide retrospective cohort study. We included individuals aged ≥ 20 years diagnosed with conditions for which anti-CD20 therapy could be considered from January 2020 to December 2021. We defined the exposure variable by prescribing rituximab (RTX) at least once according to the database. COVID-19-related outcomes included hospitalization for COVID-19, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation administration, and all-case death. Patients prescribed RTX and those not prescribed RTX were defined as RTX users and non-users, respectively. The RTX users and non-users were 1:10 propensity score matched using sex, age, insurance type, and comorbidities. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between RTX and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as COVID-19-related outcomes. Results After 1:10 propensity score matching, 932 RTX users and 8,361 RTX non-users were analyzed. The proportion of vaccinated individuals was significantly lower in RTX users than in RTX non-users (69.3% vs. 90.9%; P < 0.001). RTX use was associated with an increased risk of all-case death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39–2.46, P < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis for vaccinated individuals, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly greater for RTX users compared to non-users (aOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.02–6.04, P = 0.045), and RTX use was also associated with a significantly increased risk of hospitalization (aOR 3.79, 95% CI 1.28–11.23, P = 0.016) and all-case death (aOR 3.85, 95% CI 2.54–5.84, P < 0.001). Conclusion The use of RTX was associated with an increased risk of all-cause death in immunocompromised patients. Among vaccinated individuals, RTX users were at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as an increased risk for hospitalization of COVID-19 and all-cause death.

        <tr id="Coronaviruses infect humans with varying degrees of severity and lethality. Four of these viruses(NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1) cause mild respiratory problems in humans and three others (MERS CoV, SARS CoV including the newly emerged SARS CoV 2) can cause severe respiratory syndromes. SARS CoV 2 infection was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 24th December 2019 and in less than three months, on 11th March 2020, WHO declared COVID 19 as a pandemic. By 3rd May, 2020, 3.3 million people worldwide (213 countries) were reportedly infected and 2,38,628 individuals died of COVID 19. We note that while the infectivity of SARSCoV 2 is much higher than SARS CoV or MERS CoV , its case fatality rate (0.9 3.3%) is substantially lower than that of SARS CoV (11%) and MERS CoV (34%). For SARS CoV 2, there are notable differences in case fatality rate and disease severity among geographical regions and among age groups of infected persons, with lower severity in infants and children than in adults (1:9). The case fatality rates increased in East Asia(China and neighbourhood) and Middle East (Iran and neighbourhood) have been substantially higher than in Europe (Italy, France and Spain). By March 11, 2020 the corona virus has been changing mutations like A, A2, A2a, B, B1, B1a, B4, B2, A1a, A3, A6, A7, A2a1, A2a1a, A2a2 or A2a2a it was assigned to, based on non-missing sites. The World Health Organization (WHO) made the assessment that COVID 19 should be characterized as a pandemic. At great economic cost, many countries have adopted unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the virus such as large scale use of isolation and quarantine, closing their borders, limits of public gathering and nation wide lockdowns.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The majority of COVID-19 infections in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological (Heme-Onc) diagnoses are mild with good outcome compared to adults. Postulated reasons include cross-protection from immunity against seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV’s), subdued inflammatory responses in children than in adults and differences in humoral and T-cell responses. The objectives of this study are to compare antibody responses against HCoV’s, anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral, T-cell, and inflammatory profiles between Heme-Onc children with COVID-19 and control groups. Methods Binding IgG antibodies against Spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2, four HCoV’s (HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E), quantitative levels of 21 cytokines and 9 chemokines (multiplexed solid-phase electrochemiluminescence assay by Meso Scale Diagnostics/MSD) were compared among five cohorts: 1) children with Heme-Onc diagnoses and COVID-19 (n = 41) 2) healthy children with COVID-19 (n = 21) 3) adults with COVID-19 (n = 14) 4) children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [n = 23] and 5) healthy children without COVID-19 (n = 12). Additionally, T-cell responses against S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using ELISpot in Heme-Onc children a group of healthy children COVID-19. Results Anti-S antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV were significantly lower in children in Heme-Onc and healthy children with COVID-19 compared to adults with COVID-19 (Figure 1). The concentration of eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in Heme-Onc and healthy children compared to adults with COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. The responder T-cell frequency varied between 0 and 860/100,000 PBMC at study enrollment in children with Heme-Onc diagnoses. Conclusion In this single-center study, cross-protection from HCoV antibodies is an unlikely mechanism to explain mild COVID-19 in children, including in those with underlying hematological and oncological diagnoses. Subdued inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 could be one of the factors for the mild COVID-19 disease phenotype in children.

        <tr id="Rationale: Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical syndrome with a mortality rate of up to 40%, and it is characterized by a prominent inflammatory cascade. The inflammasome and pyroptosis play crucial regulatory roles in regulating various inflammatory-related diseases by serving as pivotal signaling platforms for inflammatory responses and mediating the release of substantial quantities of inflammatory factors. Our previous studies confirmed that GC-1, a clinical-stage thyroid hormone analog, effectively mitigated pulmonary fibrosis by restoring mitochondrial function in epithelial cells. However, the potential effects of GC-1 on macrophage inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis in lung injury as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain unclear. Methods: The effects of GC-1 on lung injury, oxidative damage and inflammation were evaluated in two murine models of ALI (LPS- or HCl-induced models) by assessing lung pathology, the concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 in BAL fluid, inflammasome and the levels of inflammasome- and pyroptosis-related proteins. Additionally, the impact of GC-1 on ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis was investigated by examining ROS levels, Nrf2 signaling, and inflammasome adaptor protein ASC levels in mouse alveolar macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages treated with LPS and ATP. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and the mitochondrial-ROS inhibitor Mito-TEMPO were used to further elucidate the effect of GC-1 on the Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. Results: GC-1 significantly alleviated inflammation and lung injury in ALI model mice, as indicated by pulmonary pathology, inflammatory cytokine levels, ROS production and pyroptosis rates. Consistently, GC-1 inhibited ASC recruitment and oligomerization in macrophages, which suppressed the gasdermin D-mediated release of IL-1β and IL-18. These findings indicated a reduction in inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis initiation. Further research revealed that GC-1 may mitigate oxidative stress induced by mitochondrial damage through Nrf2 signaling, thereby inhibiting the expression of ROS-activated p53 and the target gene ASC. This protective effect of GC-1 could be reversed by ML385 and mimicked by Mito-TEMPO. Conclusions: This study presents a novel mechanism for treating ALI in which GC-1 inhibits macrophage ROS-mediated inflammasome assembly and pyroptosis through Nrf2-p53-ASC pathway. These findings highlight the promising potential of the use of GC-1 as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drug in the treatment of ALI/ARDS.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing immune responses against pathogens. The fluctuation of Treg proportions in COVID-19 remains a topic of debate, and the mechanisms triggering Treg activation in COVID-19 are still unclear. Understanding these issues is essential for better managing immune responses in COVID-19 patients.We collected a cohort of COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and stage to explore the transcriptomic and functional traits of Tregs in these individuals. Using transcriptomic analysis, we evaluated the proportion and functionality of different Treg subsets, specifically HLA_DR+ Tregs, across different stages of COVID-19 patients.Our analysis revealed that the proportion of CCR7+ Tregs decreased as the disease advanced, while the cell proportion of HLA_DR+ regs escalated with the severity of the disease. Moreover, the transcription actor CARHSP1 exhibited apositive correlation with the proportion of HLA_DR+ Tregs. Notably, the heightened suppressive function of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients, with interactions between PF4 and CXCR3, contributed to the homeostasis of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that Tregs in COVID-19 patients exhibited weakened TCR clonotype expansion, and the suppression of HLA_DR+ Tregs with expanded TCR clonotypes in severe COVID-19 cases did not show a significant increase compared to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 groups. The findings indicate that Tregs may be activated through the bystander effect, as evidenced by the analysis of TCR clonotype characteristics.Our research delineates the diversity of dynamic alterations in Tregs and sheds light on potential mechanisms underlying Treg activation, providing a theoretical foundation and offering treatment strategies for managing COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Objective: the viral load is determined by the cycle threshold (Ct), which is inversely proportional to the amount of target sequences present in the sample. In various viral diseases, the induction of inflammatory cytokines is strongly correlated with the viral load. However, the viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly characterized, and its association with disease progression remains controversial. This study aimed to understand the correlation between the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and the biochemical and hematological markers in COVID-19-positive patients.
Methods: data from patients with detectable viral load for SARS-CoV-2 treated between March 2020 and May 2021 were collected between Jan/2023 and Jan/2024. Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation, Student's t-test, and analysis of variance.
Results: the mean Ct values for the N and ORF1AB genes were 26.73 (±3.95) and 25.93 (±4.75), respectively. A Ct value below the mean for the N and ORF1AB genes, suggesting a higher viral load, was observed in 17.8% (n=152) and 18.4% (n=157) of the patients. There was no correlation between the mean Ct and hematological or biochemical parameters, but the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was below the reference value for COVID-19-negative patients (P<0.0001). The C-reactive protein and ferritin levels were higher in patients with COVID-19 (P<0.05). Leucopenia (P<0.001), lymphocytopenia (P<0.001), neutropenia (P<0.001), and thrombocytopenia (P=0.003) were observed more frequently in patients with COVID-19.
Conclusion: the MLR below the reference value was more frequent observed in patients with a higher Ct value (lower viral load).">

        <tr id="Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a plethora of long-COVID symptoms for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe symptoms, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. Methods: This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Results: Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group who previously exhibited different symptoms (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered groups, significantly elevated in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. Following vaccination, the recovered group who experienced disease history showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p<0.005). Notably, antibody titers are negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p<0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days of two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, the titers were comparable to the baseline titer, indicating the importance of vaccination and booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infectious history. To ensure long-term respiratory health, this study emphasizes the significance of evaluating pulmonary function in those who might have contained asymptomatic COVID-19 infections as well as those who have recovered from symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Furthermore, these findings underscore the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history as a key strategy in pandemic preparedness. Conclusions: To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.">

Blood analysis showed that mains differences observed in humoral, viral, and biological biomarkers were associated with the initial COVID-19 severity, rather than being specifically linked to PASC. However, patients with PASC displayed altered CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell subsets, with higher cytokine-secreting cells and increased terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector memory T cells (TEMRA). Elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells responsive to nucleocapsid/membrane proteins with a TEMRA phenotype were also observed. A random forest model identified these features and initial symptom duration as top variables discriminating PASC, achieving over 80% classification accuracy. Highlights Nine months post-initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, over 40% of patients developed PASC Regardless of PASC, the initial disease form influenced the main immune differences PASC led to altered memory T-cell subsets with elevated TEMRA phenotype PASC presence is associated with disease form, initial symptom count and duration">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several cardiovascular complications, including myocarditis, which can be a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause cardiac muscle inflammation through direct mechanisms, such as viral invasion of myocardial cells, and indirect mechanisms, such as the systemic inflammatory response. Myocarditis can lead to life-threatening electrical dysfunctions and arrhythmias. Although post-infection myocarditis is more common, rare cases of post-vaccination myocarditis have also been reported, especially with mRNA vaccines. However, these post-vaccination cases tend to be mild and self-limiting, with a good response to treatment. Despite the associated risks, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, significantly reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections and related heart complications. It is crucial to continue surveillance and research to better understand the association between COVID-19, myocarditis and sudden cardiac death in the young and improve prevention and intervention strategies. In this literature review, we analyzed the pathogenetic mechanisms and histological features of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 and its vaccination, and focused on the correlation with sudden cardiac death.">

        <tr id="Type III interferons (IFNs) primarily act on epithelial cells and protect against virus infection of the mucosa, whereas type I IFNs act more systemically. To date, it has been unknown which epithelial subtypes in the upper airways, the primary site for initial infection for most respiratory viruses, primarily rely on type III IFN or type I IFNs for antiviral protection. To address this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptomics analysis of the epithelial IFN-mediated response focusing on the upper airways of mice. This work identified nine distinct cell types derived from the olfactory epithelium and thirteen distinct cell types from the respiratory epithelium. Interestingly, type I IFNs induced a stronger antiviral transcriptional response than type III IFN in respiratory epithelial cells, whereas in olfactory epithelial cells, including sustentacular (SUS) and Bowman's gland cells (BGC), type III IFN was more dominant compared to type I IFN. SUS and BGC, which provide structural support and maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, were highly susceptible to infection with a mouse-adapted variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA20) but were protected against infection if the animals were prophylactically treated with type III IFN. These findings demonstrate a high degree of cell type heterogeneity in terms of interferon-mediated antiviral responses and reveal a potent role for type III IFNs in protecting the olfactory epithelium.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 infects SUS and BGC in the olfactory epithelium, causing an impairment of structural support and integrity of olfactory sensory neurons that can result in severe olfactory dysfunctions. We observed an unexpected compartmentalization of the IFN-mediated transcriptional response within the airway epithelium, and we found that olfactory epithelial cells preferentially respond to type III IFN, which resulted in robust antiviral protection of SUS and BGC. Given the proximity of the olfactory epithelium to the central nervous system, we hypothesize that evolution favored a type III IFN-biased antiviral immune response in this tissue to limit inflammatory responses in the brain. Cell type-specific antiviral responses in the upper airways, triggered by the different types of IFNs, should be investigated in more detail and carefully taken into consideration during the development of IFN-based antivirals for clinical use.">

        <tr id="Objective Both B-cell- and T-cell-mediated immunity are crucial for the effective clearance of viral infection, but little is known about the dynamic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in people living with HIV (PLWH) after a full course of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods In this study, fifty people living with HIV (PLWH) and thirty healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled to assess B-cell and T-cell responses at the day before the vaccination (T0), two weeks after the first dose (T1), two months after the first dose (T2), the day of the third dose (T3), one month after the third dose (T4), three months after the third dose (T5) and 12 months (T6) after the third dose. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses were induced in people living with HIV (PLWH), and these responses lasted at least one year after the third vaccine dose. However, the peak frequencies of Spike-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in PLWH were lower than those in HIV-negative controls. In addition, the expansion of activated B cells, memory B cells and plasma cells after primary vaccination was observed, but the percentages of these cells were decreased at T6 and were comparable to those at T0. Additionally, the percentages of activated T cells, exhausted T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with enhanced functional activity were increased following the administration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, PLWH had lower percentages of plasma cells, RBD-specific B cells, circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells and CD38+ cTfh cells, and the percentages of the latter two types of cells were positively correlated with the titer of neutralizing antibodies, indicating these differences may account for the weaker immune responses induced in PLWH. Conclusion These data suggest that specific B-cell and T-cell responses could be sustained for at least one year after receiving the third vaccination. Our findings emphasize that the weak SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses induced in PLWH have implications for clinical decision-making and public health policy for PLWH with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Understanding the behavior of B cells during infection and vaccination is important for determining protective humoral immunity. We evaluated the profile of humoral immunity and B cell pool in individuals who were acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2, recovered from COVID-19, or received two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these individuals were subjected to in vitro stimulation to promote the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and the ELISpot evaluated the abundance of pan and SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-reactive IgG+ ASC. Stimulated PBMCs were characterized using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were assessed for soluble B-cell-activating factors. The IgA and IgG for the S1 were evaluated through ELISA. Results: The recovered individuals displayed a robust S1 ASC compared to acute and vaccinated individuals. Although the frequency of total B cells or B cell subsets did not vary among the groups, plasmablast cells were increased in naïve and double-negative B cells in the acute, recovered, and vaccinated individuals. Similar IgA and IgG production appeared to be present in the acute and recovered individuals. During vaccination, more IgG is produced than IgA. In acute patients, BAFF levels were positively correlated with total B cells and IgG+ plasmablast cells but negatively correlated with IgA+ plasmablast cells. Conclusions: Vaccination and natural infection with COVID-19 induce a differential profile and functionality of B cells. We suggest that new vaccines against COVID-19 incorporate molecular adjuvants that regulate B lymphocyte functionality and consider the beneficial aspects of the IgA response in addition to IgG.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bacteria exhibit distinct behaviors in laboratory settings compared to infection environments. The presence of host cells induces changes in bacterial activity, while pathogens trigger immune responses that shape the microenvironment. Studying infection dynamics by microscopy, cytokine screening, and dual RNA sequencing in an air–liquid interface model, we found that prolonged Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization of airway epithelium led to a pro-inflammatory response, consistent across P. aeruginosa strains, despite differences in the dynamics of this response. Concurrently, P. aeruginosa formed non-attached aggregates on the apical side of the cell layer and upregulated genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence. Notably, there was remarkable resemblance between the P. aeruginosa transcriptional profile in our model and that previously reported upon host cell contact. Developing a platform that replicates host microenvironments is vital not only for gaining deeper insights into the interplay between host and pathogen but also for evaluating therapeutic strategies in conditions that closely mirror clinical environments.">

 Neurological symptoms are among the most frequent extrapulmonary complications of COVID-19, affecting more than 30% of patients. To this date, there has not been any direct evidence of viral replication within living human brain tissue.



 Brain specimens were obtained from ten patients undergoing epileptogenic disconnection surgery. Slices were oxygenated in artificial CSF(aCSF), cultured with neuroprotective media, then co-cultured with COVID-19 viral variants Delta, Omicron, Washington. RNA was extracted and sequenced using Next-Generation Sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at p-values <0.05 and log2FC of 1. Gene-ontology analysis was conducted, and normalized enrichment score (NES) was calculated.



 Quantitative-PCR initially demonstrated robust viral infection and replication within isolated cells from brain slices. PCA was conducted, showing clustering between COVID-19 variants compared to control brain slices. A total of 1743, 564 and 1011 DEGs were identified in the Omicron, Delta and Washington infected tissues, respectively. Interestingly, Gene-Ontology annotation of DEGs showed increased likelihood of transcriptomic correlation with neurological and psychiatric diseases including depression, PTSD, anxiety, suicidality, insomnia, and brain aging, with Delta variant having the highest enrichment score. RNA deconvolution analysis showed significant viral-induced transcriptomic changes on different brain tissue cells including astrocytes, excitatory neurons, and oligodendrocytes, with NES of 1.86, 1.64 and 1.94, respectively (P < 0.001).



 For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, our unique ex-vivo human brain slice assay has allowed for the ability to capture direct viral replication within the human brain parenchyma, in addition to demonstrating transcriptomics correlation with neurological manifestations such as depression and PTSD, that have become a highly prevalent sequala of this debilitating infection.

Our findings reveal that HMC3 cells responded to both treatments through upregulation of immune, metabolic, and antiviral pathways, while C20 cells showed a response associated with mitochondrial and immune activities. Additionally, the secretome analysis demonstrated that both cell lines release IL-6 in response to LPS, while IFN-γ treatment resulted in altered kynurenine pathway activity, highlighting distinct immune and metabolic adaptations.">

        <tr id="Long-term adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), are a major component of overall COVID-19 disease burden. Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with increased rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and death in elderly individuals. Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals. IMPORTANCE Elderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bats are reservoirs for multiple viruses, some of which are known to cause global disease outbreaks. Virus spillovers from bats have been implicated in zoonotic transmission. Some bat species can tolerate viral infections, such as infections with coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses, better than humans and with less clinical consequences. Bat species are speculated to have evolved alongside these viral pathogens, and adaptations within the bat immune system are considered to be associated with viral tolerance. Inflammation and cell death in response to zoonotic virus infections prime human immunopathology. Unlike humans, bats have evolved adaptations to mitigate virus infection-induced inflammation. Inflammatory cell death pathways such as necroptosis and pyroptosis are associated with immunopathology during virus infections, but their regulation in bats remains understudied. This review focuses on the regulation of inflammation and cell death pathways in bats. We also provide a perspective on the possible contribution of cell death-regulating proteins, such as caspases and gasdermins, in modulating tissue damage and inflammation in bats. Understanding the role of these adaptations in bat immune responses can provide valuable insights for managing future disease outbreaks, addressing human disease severity, and improving pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected individuals showed either mild symptoms or were paucisymptomatic, with severe impact on human health, revealing heightened risk and direct effects on health. Among various factors contributing to complications, bacterial and fungal co-infection remains very common and is highly lethal. This narrative review aims to focus on the collective role of gut microbiota and mycobiota in COVID-19. Fungal infection has been identified as a key risk factor for the spread of COVID-19 and mortality. Gut mycobiomes diversity and abundance also vary due to the different types of SARS-CoV-2 variant infection. Their cross-talk plays a vital role in immune regulation and disease severity, with an emphasis on understanding the altered condition as a predictive marker. On the other hand, the gut microbiome is well known for shaping metabolic functions, generating immune responses, and deciphering the signal to decide the healthy state and disease condition of an individual. Immune response during COVID-19 infection was also linked with metabolites produced by the gut microflora, specifically amino acids, sugar metabolites, and neurotransmitters. The cross-talk between gut microbiota and gut mycobiota for clinical implications in terms of early detection, identification of the disease severity, and even therapeutic alternatives will open newer avenues. A deep dive understanding of the cross-talk between the microbiome and mycobiome, and their role in immune response will take scientific discovery knowledge to develop gut-targeted safe therapeutic approaches in the form of FMT (fecal microbiota transplantation) probiotics, peptides, antibacterial, and antifungal metabolites. Overall cross-talk and immune interplay are critical determinants of host immunity, providing insights into their role and key take home lessons for better management of crisis in the future.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The pathogenesis of Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) following mild coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unclear. In particular, the involvement of activated mast cells (MC) in the highly angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing small bowel, the largest lymphoid organ, might be significant in PCS pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the role of activated MC, residual SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and zonulin (a marker for impaired intestinal integrity), in the context of PCS, examining peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI) 2 years post-infection. Methods In this cross-sectional, controlled study, paired PB and TI samples were obtained from 21 SARS-CoV-2 convalescents with (PCS+) and 11 without PCS (PCS−). CD117+CD25+ activated MC and residual S protein were assessed using fluorescent immunohistochemistry on sections of the the ileal tissue from the gut. Tryptase, zonulin and S protein were quantified in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assessed frequencies of T-cells (CD3+CD4+ (TCD4), CD3+CD8+ T-cells (TCD8)) and CCR7±CD27± memory subsets (TCM: T central memory, TEM: T effector memory) on mononuclear cells of PB and TI. Results Among PCS+ and PCS−, median follow up was 22 and 18 months post-infection, 81% and 73% were female, and 57% and 55% had pre-existing conditions of which arterial hypertension, chronic lung disease and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent. Compared to PCS−, PCS+ expressed significantly more MC (p< 0.0001) in ileal sections, along with elevated levels of tryptase (p=0.0196) and zonulin (p=0.024) in PB. S protein, by contrast, was undetectable in PB of PCS+ and PCS− even 2 years post-infection. In TI however, the frequency of tissue-resident S protein-infected cells was significantly higher in PCS+ compared to PCS− (p=0.0135). Interestingly, systemic tryptase levels correlated positively to elevated TCM in TI (r=0.7407, p=0.0034). Conclusion Elevated MC activity and S protein in the TI, along with increased tryptase and zonulin levels in PB, indicate ongoing immune activation and intestinal damage in the TI of PCS+. Understanding the role of tissue-resident MC in PCS pathogenesis could lead to targeted therapies. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, a respiratory disease that can range in presentation from mild symptoms to severe conditions such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2, a single-stranded RNA virus, spreads through aerosols and respiratory droplets. It enters human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, leading to various complications, including significant alterations in red blood cells and potential disruptions in haemoglobin function and oxygen transport. During infection, the interaction between hypoxia, inflammation, and haematopoiesis affects erythropoiesis at multiple levels. Hypoxia and inflammation, resulting from lung complications and a reduced red blood cell count, influence the regulation of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron levels in the blood. Elevated hepcidin levels are associated with hypoxia and the suppression of erythroferrone, a hormone that normally inhibits hepcidin production. Despite high levels of inflammation, patients in intensive care units often exhibit elevated ferritin levels, which, rather than indicating low hepcidin, suggest disrupted iron metabolism and the development of severe anaemia. Iron is kept in stores, likely due to paradoxically high hepcidin levels, which explains the elevated ferritin measurements. An increase in immature blood cells and a decrease in CD71+ erythroid cells are observed. The elevated levels of CD71+ erythroid cells highlight their dual role in modulating hyper-inflammation and immune response during disease progression. This review examines the pathway by which SARS-CoV-2 affects red blood cell production and the haematopoietic system and how it triggers cytokine storms through interleukins, immature blood cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells. Understanding these processes provides novel pathways for managing haematological manifestations and immune responses in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 vaccines have prevented millions of COVID-19 deaths. Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post- vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 3–6% of people suffer from post-COVID condition or syndrome (PCS). A subset meets the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA can persist after acute infection in serum or tissues, but their role in PCS is unclear. Methods: Here, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analyzed in the serum of 121 PCS patients with predominant fatigue and exertional intolerance, of whom 72 met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, 37 post-COVID recovered healthy controls, and 32 pre-pandemic healthy controls. Results: Spike protein was detected in the serum of 11% of recovered controls, 2% of PCS patients, and 14% of ME/CFS patients between 4 and 31 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not in pre-pandemic samples. The occurrence and concentration of spike protein did not correlate with infection or vaccination timepoints. In ME/CFS patients, spike protein presence was not associated with the severity of symptoms or functional disability. In 5 out of 22 patients who under-went immunoglobulin depletion, spike protein levels were reduced or undetectable after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins. Conclusions: In summary, this study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients but found no association with ME/CFS.">

        <tr id="Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, poses a significant global health challenge, especially among high-risk populations. This study investigates the temporal dynamics of pulmonary gene expression during S. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia using a murine model to elucidate host-pathogen interactions and identify potential biomarkers of disease severity. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we analyzed lung tissues at early (1h, 8h) and acute infection (2d, 3d), as well as post-resolution (30d) time-points. At 2 days post-infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed heightened innate immune responses, including chemokine and interferon signaling pathways. By 30 days post-infection, gene expression profiles and histological changes normalized, reflecting resolution of inflammation. Stratifying mice into recovered, sick, and moribund phenotypes during the acute infection phase highlighted significant transcriptional distinctions, including upregulated pro-inflammatory genes and Schlafen family members. Arginase 1 emerged as a predictive marker of disease severity, with elevated expression detectable as early as 8 hours post-infection. Comparative analyses revealed significant overlap between transcriptional responses in our model and those from a Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia model, implicating conserved pathways, such as IL-17 and Toll-like receptor signaling. Additionally, murine DEGs correlated with human plasma proteins associated with severe CAP, including CCL8 and CD14, suggesting translational relevance. This study underscores phase-specific transcriptional reprogramming during pneumococcal pneumonia and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in severe CAP cases.">

        <tr id="Background: The Safety and Immunogenicity of COVID-19 Vaccines in Systemic Autoimmune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (SUCCEED) study was created to better understand COVID-19 vaccination in immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID). Knowing the frequency of COVID-19 breakthrough infections is important, particularly in IMID. Our objective was to assess these events in IMID. Methods: We prospectively studied IMID participants who had received ≥three COVID-19 vaccine doses. Individuals provided saliva samples monthly (September 2022 to August 2023). These were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. We also assessed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (anti-spike, SmT1, receptor binding domain, RBD, and nucleocapsid, NP) based on dried blood spots. Multivariable general estimating equation regression produced odd ratios (OR) for PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity, related to demographics, immunosuppressives, and antibody levels. Results: Diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis RA (N = 161, 44% of the total), systemic lupus, psoriatic arthritis, spondylarthritis, vasculitis, systemic sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Of the 366 participants, most were taking immunosuppressive medication. Of 1266 saliva samples, 56 (5.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR. Higher anti-SmT1 antibodies were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection on PCR (adjusted OR 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.97). Antibodies to SmT1, RBD, and NP were correlated and thus could not be included in a single model, but when anti-RBD was used in place of anti-SmT1, the results were similar. No other factor (including prior COVID-19 infection) was clearly associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: This is the first study of SARS-CoV-2 in a large prospective cohort of triple (or more) vaccinated individuals with IMIDs. Anti-SmT1 antibodies appeared to be protective against later SARS-CoV-2 positivity, although recent past infection was not clearly related. This suggests the importance of maintaining robust vaccine-induced immunity through vaccination in IMID.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunosenescence, age‐related immune dysregulation, reduces immunity upon vaccinations and infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection results in declining naïve (Tnaïve) and increasing terminally differentiated (Temra) T cell populations, further aggravating immune aging. Both immunosenescence and CMV have been speculated to hamper the formation of protective T‐cell immunity against novel or emerging pathogens. The SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic presented a unique opportunity to examine the impact of age and/or CMV on the generation of de novo SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cell responses in 40 younger (22–40 years) and 37 older (50–66 years) convalescent individuals. Heterotetramer combinatorial coding combined with phenotypic markers were used to study 35 SARS‐CoV‐2 epitope‐specific CD8+ T cell populations directly ex vivo. Neither age nor CMV affected SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cell frequencies, despite reduced total CD8+ Tnaïve cells in older CMV‐ and CMV+ individuals. Robust SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific central memory CD8+ T (Tcm) responses were detected in younger and older adults regardless of CMV status. Our data demonstrate that immune aging and CMV status did not impact the SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cell response. However, SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific CD8+ T cells of older CMV‐ individuals displayed the lowest stem cell memory (Tscm), highest Temra and PD1+ populations, suggesting that age, not CMV, may impact long‐term SARS‐CoV‐2 immunity.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 global pandemic, leads to a wide variety of responses among patients. Some of them present a very severe phenotype, while others only experience mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic. This differential prognosis is tightly related to the inflammatory status of the patient. Although WHO declared the end of the emergency, the pandemic caused a great socio-sanitary impact in all countries. Thus, the possible outbreak of new biological diseases in the future makes it necessary to deepen the knowledge of this uncontrolled immune response and look for reliable biomarkers to help us predict its potential health impact. Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) as lipoxins are endogenous mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid in the resolution stage of any inflammatory process. These lipids have pro-resolving actions in several pathological models, including reducing NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and inducing the antioxidant response through the Nrf-2 pathway. Thus, although a potential relationship has already been suggested between low levels of SPMs and COVID-19 severity, their true role as a predictive biomarker is still unknown. Methods and results In this study, we have analyzed by ELISA the serum levels of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in a representative Spanish cohort. We found reduced levels in deceased patients when compared to mild or severe patients, concomitant with a decrease in the LXA4 biosynthetic pathway and an increase in its degradation pathway. Furthermore, we have studied the correlation between the levels of this SPM and several pathology indicators, finding a significant correlation between increased LXA4 levels and a better prognosis of the patients. Conclusion We propose to measure systemic LXA4 as a new promising biomarker to predict the survival in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and presumably to other viruses that can affect humanity in the future.">

        <tr id="  COVID-19 disease is a clinical syndrome caused by an envelope RNA virus, called SARS-COV-2., which causes infection with wildly clinical pictures. Through COVID-19 infection several components of humoral and cellular immune response have an important role in the progression of the infection. Chemokines are one of the inflammatory mediators that play an essential role in the immune pathogenesis of COVID-19. It is secreted by respiratory virus-infected cells in the upper respiratory tract, causing stimulation and recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, NK, eosinophils, and macrophages from the bloodstream to the site of the infection. This study strives to determine the impact role of inflammatory mediator chemokine RANTES (CCL5) in COVID-19 Iraq patients. Blood samples collected from 180 individuals were enrolled in this study, 120 of them were patients infected with COVID-19 and verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients were categorized into two groups based on the severity of the disease, the severe group included 60 patients and the mild/moderate group included 60 patients also. Furthermore, 60 healthy individuals who were confirmed to be COVID-19-negative were enrolled in this study as a control group. The quantitative detection of CCL5 in human serum was done by the CCL5 Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay kit based on the principle of sandwich ELISA. This study showed that there were interesting highly significant differences (p<0.001) in the median serum level of CCL5 between all groups that participated in this study and there was a significant increase in the median level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate groups versus severe patients’ group (66.66 pg/ml, and 54.04 pg/ml vs. 38.41 pg/ml respectively). According to the results of this study, the low level of CCL5 associated with COVID-19 severity infection could be used as a predictor marker for severity while the elevated level of CCL5 in control and mild-moderate suggested the elevated level of this chemokine is likely to be associated with the resolution of inflammation and recovery.">

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Backgroud Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly identified tick-borne viral disease with a high mortality rate. Monocytes are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SFTS, but the distinct subpopulations of monocytes associated with the disease progression and their roles in inflammatory responses remain unclear. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore the specific monocyte subpopulations correlated with the progression of SFTS and their involvement in inflammatory processes. Methods scRNA-seq analysis was conducted on isolated monocytes from seven SFTS patients, validated by cell identification through flow cytometry. Comparative analyses were performed using three normal monocyte samples from public databases. Bioinformatic tools including Cell Ranger, Seurat, Monocle 2, GSEA, and SCENIC were utilized to identify distinct cell populations and transcriptional patterns. Results Our results indicate that severe SFTS patients in the ICU exhibited a reduced proportion of circulating HLA-DR+CD14+ monocytes compared to non-severe hospitalized SFTS patients, indicating a dysfunctional immune response. Increased numbers of CD163+CD14+ monocytes in acute SFTS patients correlated with disease severity. CD163+CD14+ monocytes were identified as potential target cells for SFTSV infection. SFTSV infection could drive monocyte differentiation into the M2 phenotype, promoting virus persistence and disease advancement. Conclusion Our studies in SFTS patients have shown that monocytes are target cells for SFTSV. Notably, an expansion of CD163+CD14+ monocytes in SFTS has been shown to be associated with severe clinical disease. In addition, activated IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling in SFTS patients induced CD163+CD14+ monocyte expansion, which was recovered by tofacitinib treatment.">

        <tr id="As the resident macrophages of the brain, microglia are crucial immune cells specific to the central nervous system (CNS). They constantly surveil their surroundings and trigger immunological reactions, playing a key role in various neurodegenerative diseases (ND). As illnesses progress, microglia exhibit multiple phenotypes. Traditionally, microglia have been classified into two main phenotypes upon activation: the pro-inflammatory M1 polarization and the anti-inflammatory M2 polarization. However, this classification is now considered overly simplistic, as it is unable to fully convey the intricacy and diversity of the inflammatory response. Immune regulatory factors, such as chemokines secreted by microglia, are essential for modulating brain development, maintaining the neural milieu, and orchestrating responses to injury, along with the subsequent repair processes. However, in recent years, the significance of metabolic reprogramming in both physiological microglial activity and ND has also become increasingly recognized. Upon activation-triggered by brain injury, infection, or ND-microglia typically modify their metabolic processes by transitioning from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) phosphorylation to glycolysis. This shift facilitates rapid energy production but may also enhance pro-inflammatory responses. This review seeks to summarize metabolic reprogramming and polarization in the function of microglia and their involvement in ND.">

        <tr id="The polymorphism of human leukocyte antigens in the Northeast Asian populations and the lack of broad-spectrum T-cell epitopes covering this cohort markedly limited the development of T cell-directed vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also hampered the universal detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells. In this study, 93 CD4+ T-cell epitopes restricted by 12 prevalent HLA-DRB1 allotypes, which covering over 80% Chinese and Northeast Asian populations, were identified from the S, E, M, N and RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV-2 by in silico prediction, DC-peptide-PBL coculture experiment, and immunization in HLA-A2/DR1 transgenic mice. Furthermore, by using validated 215 CD8+ T cell epitope peptides and 123 CD4+ T-cell epitope peptides covering Northeast Asian cohort, the universal ELISpot detection systems of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were established, for the first time, and followed by the tests for 50 unexposed and 100 convalescent samples. The median of spot-forming units for CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were 68 and 15, respectively, in the unexposed donors, but were 137 and 52 in the convalescent donors 6 months after recovery while 128 and 47 in the convalescent donors 18 months after recovery. This work initially provided the broad-spectrum CD4+ T-cell epitope library of SARS-CoV-2 for the design of T cell-directed vaccines and the universal T cell detection tool tailoring to Northeast Asian population, and confirmed the long-term memory T cell immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to significant global morbidity and mortality. While many patients recover, a subset experiences persistent pulmonary complications, including post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF), a condition characterized by irreversible lung scarring and impaired gas exchange. Several risk factors, such as advanced age, male sex, pre-existing lung disease, and severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, contribute to its development. Radiological assessments, particularly high-resolution computed tomography, reveal hallmark features such as reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and parenchymal bands, aiding in diagnosis. Current therapeutic strategies include corticosteroids, antifibrotic agents (pirfenidone, Nintedanib), and immunosuppressants, though no standardized treatment exists. Pulmonary rehabilitation and supplemental oxygen therapy offer symptomatic relief and improved functional outcomes. Future research explores novel agents, including buloxibutid, saracatinib, sirolimus, and resveratrol, as potential antifibrotic therapies. This review provides an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and evolving treatment strategies for PCPF, emphasizing the need for continued research to optimize patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Development of novel vaccines and treatment approaches against tuberculosis are hampered by limited knowledge of what constitutes a protective immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Granulomas are organized immune aggregates that form in the lung in response to mycobacterial infection and are an important site of pathogen-host interaction. The composition and cellular microenvironment within the granuloma impacts the bacterial control capacity. To identify protective responses in granulomas, imaging mass cytometry was used to study archived lung tissue from low dose Mtb-infected non-human primates presenting with various levels of disease. This approach revealed that granuloma composition is correlated with the severity of lung pathology. Granulomas of animals with limited lung pathology were enriched for NK cells showing increased interactions with tissue macrophages. This work improves our understanding of local immune interactions in the lung and how these correlate with severity of tuberculosis disease. Author summary Tuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease in the world with 10 million new infections and 1.5 million deaths annually. The existing vaccine is not effective enough to halt the tuberculosis epidemic. In order to develop an improved vaccine, more complete and detailed knowledge on the immune responses that can successfully protect against tuberculosis is required. Individuals that are exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis disease, fall along a spectrum, with some individuals showing a strong innate capacity to protect against disease, while others fall ill. By studying these differences in a model organism, namely non-human primates, we can learn about protective immune responses. In primates with limited disease, the immune cell aggregates surrounding the bacteria in the lung contained more NK cells than were found in severe disease. In addition, interactions between NK cells and macrophages, cells that can eat bacteria, were seen a lot more in protected animals. This suggests that the interaction between NK cell and macrophages contributes to controlling tuberculosis disease, this knowledge can contribute to improved vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="The contributions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells to vaccine efficacy and durability are unclear. We investigated relationships between mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific interferon- gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody development in long-term care home staff doubly vaccinated with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. The impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity on cellular and humoral responses to vaccination were additionally assessed. Mathematical modeling of the kinetics of spike-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 T-cell responses over 6 months post-second dose was bifurcated into recipients who exhibited gradual increases with doubling times of 155 and 167 days or decreases with half-lives of 165 and 132 days, respectively. Differences in kinetics did not correlate with clinical phenotypes. Serological anti-spike IgG, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, anti-spike IgA, and anti-RBD IgA antibody levels otherwise decayed in all participants with half-lives of 63, 57, 79, and 46 days, respectively, alongside waning neutralizing capacity (t1/2 = 408 days). Spike-specific T-cell responses induced at 2-6 weeks positively correlated with live viral neutralization at 6 months post-second dose, especially in hybrid immune individuals. Participants with pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 exhibited greater spike-specific T-cell responses, reduced anti-RBD IgA antibody levels, and a trending increase in neutralization at 2-6 weeks post-second dose. Non-spike-specific T-cells predominantly targeted SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein at 6 months post-second dose in cross-reactive participants. mRNA vaccination was lastly shown to induce off-target T-cell responses against unrelated antigens. In summary, vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell immunity appeared to influence serological neutralizing capacity, with only a modest effect induced by pre-existing cross-reactivity.


IMPORTANCE
Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential contributions of mRNA vaccine-induced spike-specific T-cell responses to the durability of neutralizing antibody levels in both uninfected and hybrid immune recipients. Our study additionally sheds light on the precise impacts of pre-existing cross-reactive T-cell immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on the magnitude and kinetics of cellular and humoral responses to vaccination. Accordingly, our data will help optimize the development of next-generation T cell-based coronavirus vaccines and vaccine regimens to maximize efficacy and durability.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause hyperstimulation of the immune system, sometimes leading to the production of various autoantibodies and increased levels of interferons and interleukins in blood plasma. Background/Objectives: Only a few studies are currently focusing on the dynamics of immunological indices after any transferred infectious disease encountered by an organism for the first time. The attention of researchers and clinicians is captured by the dynamics of antibody titers and immunologic markers (interferons and interleukins), as well as the correlation of immunologic indices with changes in the symptomatology of long COVID. This paper discusses the association of antibodies against various autoantigens with rheumatological and neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Our study patient was a 36-year-old man diagnosed with polyneuropathy, which developed after COVID-19. We conducted a dynamic follow-up of the patient for two years. Methods: The blood plasma samples collected were analyzed by ELISA for different autoantigens, IFN-γ, and a variety of interleukins. Results: An association between rheumatologic and neurologic markers in patients with long COVID symptoms was considered. Antibody titers for myelin basic protein (MBP), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 levels significantly increased during the posthospital period when the patient reported persistent symptoms of long COVID, with complaints decreasing after the symptoms were resolved. Conclusions: The findings of this study shed light on the dynamic alterations of immunological factors, and elucidate the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupts immunotolerance and eventually restores equilibrium, leading to the rheumatological pathology. Significantly, the notable rise in antibody titers for various autoantigens was transient and did not lead to the progression of autoimmune pathology.">

        <tr id="The novel H10N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) has infected four individuals since 2021 and caused severe respiratory damage, posing a significant threat to public health. However, its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our findings revealed that H10N3 infection induces severe lung damage and causes death in mice, even at low doses. The elevated levels of multiple pro-inflammatory factors in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly increased during infection, displaying hallmarks of a cytokine storm. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed systematic activation of inflammation-related pathways, predicting that viral infection induces multiple forms of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Protein-level validation showed that the activation of key cell death markers, including Caspase-3, GSDMD, and MLKL, significantly increased as the infection progressed, with their dynamic changes correlating strongly with the expression pattern of viral proteins. This study elucidates the central role of the synergistic effect between the cytokine storm and multiple cell death pathways in H10N3 pathogenesis. These findings not only advance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AIVs but also provide a critical theoretical basis for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background As the COVID‐19 pandemic nears resolution in 2024, the mechanisms by which SARS‐CoV‐2 and other viral infections induce spermatogenic dysfunction remain poorly understood. This review examines the mechanisms by which viral infections, particularly COVID‐19, disrupt spermatogenesis and highlights the implications for male reproductive health. While reports suggest that spermatogenic dysfunction caused by COVID‐19 is mild and transient, these findings may have broader applications in understanding and treating spermatogenic dysfunction caused by future viral infections. Methods The PubMed database was searched to identify original and review articles investigating the mechanisms by which viral infections, particularly SARS‐CoV‐2, contribute to spermatogenic dysfunction. Main Findings SARS‐CoV‐2 affects the testis through multiple mechanisms, including ACE2 receptor‐mediated entry, direct viral damage, inflammatory response, blood–testis barrier disruption, hormonal imbalance, oxidative stress, and impaired spermatogenesis. The combination of these factors can disrupt testicular function and highlights the complexity of the effects of COVID‐19 on male reproductive health. Conclusion COVID‐19 may disrupt spermatogenesis through direct testicular infection, systemic inflammation, hormonal disruption, and oxidative stress. Ongoing research, vaccination efforts, and clinical vigilance are essential to address these challenges and develop effective treatment and prevention strategies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Knowledge of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the innate and adaptive immune responses of children is currently lacking. We investigated the immune profile of recovered pediatric patients 3 to 11 weeks after acute COVID-19.


METHODS
Children who were previously healthy or had a preexisting chronic disease and had a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/serology were enrolled (n=23). The control group was composed of 25 patients without COVID-19 paired by age, sex and baseline chronic conditions. We performed immunophenotyping, hematologic and inflammatory markers analysis, cytokines and T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) quantifications.


RESULTS
Most COVID-19 convalescent pediatric patients (COVID-19 CPP) had chronic conditions (73.9%), as well as 80% of the controls. Five children developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. COVID-19 CPP had higher lymphocyte numbers than controls due to an increase in CD4+ T cells. Naive, effector memory (EM) reexpressing CD45RA T cells and follicular CD4+ T cells, as well as TRECs and HLA-DR+ and CD38+CD4+ activated T lymphocytes, were increased in those patients. EM2 and EM3 CD4+ T cells, EM2 CD8+ T cells and memory B cells were elevated in the COVID-19 CPP group. Numbers of neutrophils, monocytes and natural killer cells were equivalent but with increased activation in the recovered patients.


CONCLUSIONS
In the short-term following infection, COVID-19-recovered patients show persistent activation profiles in phagocytes, T-cell subtypes and natural killer cells. Meanwhile, increased production of lymphocytes, TRECs and naive T cells suggests immune response recovery, even in immunosuppressed patients and children with comorbidities. The clinical implications of these findings should be further studied.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 is an oral pathogen that infects and replicates in mucosal and salivary epithelial cells, contributing to oral post‐acute sequelae COVID‐19 (PASC) and other oral and non‐oral pathologies. While pre‐existing inflammatory oral diseases provides a conducive environment for the virus, acute infection and persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 can also results in oral microbiome dysbiosis that further worsens poor oral mucosal health. Indeed, oral PASC includes periodontal diseases, dysgeusia, xerostomia, pharyngitis, oral keratoses, and pulpitis suggesting significant bacterial contributions to SARS‐CoV‐2 and oral tissue tropism. Dysbiotic microbiome‐induced inflammation can promote viral entry via angiotensin‐converting enzyme receptor‐2 (ACE2), serine transmembrane TMPRSS2 and possibly other non‐canonical pathways. Additionally, metabolites derived from a dysbiotic microbiome can alter the physiological and biochemical pathways related to the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This may promote a pro‐inflammatory microenvironment, leading to immune exhaustion, loss of tolerance, and susceptibility to a variety of oral pathogens, causing acute and later chronic inflammation. Microbial release of mimics of host metallopeptidases related to furin, ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17), and glycoprotein metabolites can further aid viral attachment to T cell immunoglobulin‐like (TIMs), enhancing viral entry while simultaneously depressing oral mucosal immune resistance and clearance. Membrane reorganization characterised by neuroproteins, such as neuropilins, also functionally assists with SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and extends the pathogenesis of PASC from the oral cavity to the brain, gut, or other non‐oral tissues. Thus, poor oral health, characterised by disrupted oral microbiomes can promote viral tropism, weaken antiviral resistance, and heightens susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This immune dysfunction also increases the risk of additional viral infections, exacerbating oral conditions like periodontal and endodontic diseases. These persistent oral health issues can contribute to systemic inflammation, creating bidirectional effects between oral and non‐oral tissues, potentially leading to Post‐Acute Sequelae of COVID‐19 (PASC).">

        <tr id="The immune status of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in different stages of infection remains difficult to determine. In this study, we performed high-throughput single-cell mass cytometry on peripheral blood samples from 10 COVID-19 patients and four healthy donors to analyze their immune status at acute and convalescence phases. During the acute stage, the proportion of neutrophils increased significantly while natural killer (NK) cells decreased. In contrast, during the convalescence phase, the proportion of plasma cells decreased from the acute stage of disease onset and was lower than normal. The proportions of B, mast and plasma cell subsets decreased significantly with the process of disease recovery. Further analysis of the subsets of major immune cell types in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations in different stages showed that in the acute stages of disease progression, the T helper cell 1 (Th1), IgD+ B and neutrophil subsets increased in COVID-19 patients, especially in symptomatic patients, while the central memory CD4+T cells (CD4 TCM), mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) and NK cell subsets decreased significantly, especially in symptomatic patients. Then CD4 TCM and MAIT returned to normal levels at the recovery phase. Dynamic assessment displayed that the immune imbalance at the onset of COVID-19 could be corrected during recovery. Our study provides additional information on the immune status of COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations in different stages. These findings may provide new insights into COVID-19 immunotherapy and immune intervention.">

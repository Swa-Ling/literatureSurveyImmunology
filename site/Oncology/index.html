        <tr id="Introduction Over the past four years, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious global health challenges. The severe form of disease and death resulted from the failure of immune regulatory mechanisms, closely highlighted by the dual proinflammatory cytokine and soluble immune checkpoint (sICP) storm. Identifying the individual factors impacting on disease severity, evolution and outcome, as well as any additional interconnections, have become of high scientific interest. Methods In this study, we evaluated a novel panel composed of ten sICPs for the predictive values of COVID-19 disease severity, mortality and Delta vs. Omicron variant infections in relation to hyperinflammatory biomarkers. The serum levels of sICPs from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital admission were determined by Luminex, and artificial neural network analysis was applied for defining the distinct patterns of molecular associations with each form of disease: mild, moderate, and severe. Results Notably, distinct sICP profiles characterized various stages of disease and Delta infections: while sCD40 played a central role in all defined diagrams, the differences emerged from the distribution levels of four molecules recently found and relatively less investigated (sCD30, s4-1BB, sTIM-1, sB7-H3), and their associations with various hematological and biochemical inflammatory biomarkers. The artificial neural network analysis revealed the prominent role of serum sTIM-1 and Galectin-9 levels at hospital admission in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors, as well as the role of specific anti-interleukin therapy (Tocilizumab, Anakinra) in improving survival for patients with initially high sTIM-1 levels. Furthermore, strong associations between sCD40 and Galectin-9 with suPAR defined the Omicron variant infections, while the positive match of sCD40 with sTREM-1 serum levels characterized the Delta-infected patients. Conclusions Of importance, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulatory immune factors governing the COVID-19 pathology, and identifies key roles of sCD40, sTIM-1, and Galectin-9 in predicting mortality.">

        <tr id="Tissue-specific immune responses are critical determinants of health-maintaining homeostasis and disease-related dysbiosis. In the context of COVID-19, oral immune responses reflect local host-pathogen dynamics near the site of infection and serve as important "windows to the body," reflecting systemic responses to the invading SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study leveraged multiplex technology to characterize the salivary SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological landscape (37 cytokines/chemokines and 11 antibodies) during early infection. Cytokine/immune profiling was performed on unstimulated cleared whole saliva collected from 227 adult SARS-CoV-2+ participants and 37 controls. Statistical analysis and modeling revealed significant differential abundance of 25 cytokines (16 downregulated, 9 upregulated). Pathway analysis demonstrated early SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with local suppression of oral type I/III interferon and blunted natural killer-/T-cell responses, reflecting a potential novel immune-evasion strategy enabling infection. This virus-associated immune suppression occurred concomitantly with significant upregulation of proinflammatory pathways including marked increases in the acute phase proteins pentraxin-3 and chitinase-3-like-1. Irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior vaccination was associated with increased total α-SARS-CoV-2-spike (trimer), -S1 protein, -RBD, and -nucleocapsid salivary antibodies, highlighting the importance of COVID-19 vaccination in eliciting mucosal responses. Altogether, our findings highlight saliva as a stable and accessible biofluid for monitoring host responses to SARS-CoV-2 over time and suggest that oral-mucosal immune dysregulation is a hallmark of early SARS-CoV-2 infection, with possible implications for viral evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for causing the COVID-19 pandemic. Intensive research has illuminated the complex biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its continuous evolution during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. While much attention has been paid to the structure and functions of the viral spike protein and the entry step of viral infection, partly because these are targets for neutralizing antibodies and COVID-19 vaccines, the later stages of SARS-CoV-2 replication, including the assembly and egress of viral progenies, remain poorly characterized. This includes insight into how the activities of the viral structural proteins are orchestrated spatially and temporally, which cellular proteins are assimilated by the virus to assist viral assembly, and how SARS-CoV-2 counters and evades the cellular mechanisms antagonizing virus assembly. In addition to becoming infectious, SARS-CoV-2 progenies also need to survive the hostile innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, such as recognition by neutralizing antibodies. This review offers an updated summary of the roles of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in viral assembly, the regulation of assembly by viral and cellular factors, and the cellular mechanisms that restrict this process. Knowledge of these key events often reveals the vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and aids in the development of effective antiviral therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, iron toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) are widely held to drive tissue damage, yet the specific roles of central nervous system (CNS)- resident versus CNS-invading MPs remain unclear. Here, by combining single-cell profiling with conditional gene targeting, we systematically dissected and interfered with ROS production across CNS MPs in a preclinical model for neuroinflammation. We show that CNS-invading monocyte derived cells (MdCs) exhibit a higher oxidative stress gene signature and produce more ROS compared to CNS-resident microglia. While NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a phagocytic source of ROS, proved redundant, our findings underscore the critical role of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in driving oxidative tissue damage. Quenching mtROS through mitocatalase overexpression in MdCs, but not microglia, significantly alleviated neuroinflammation in mice. Thus, our study resolves a longstanding controversy, identifying MdCs as the primary driver of ROS-mediated neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication. IMPORTANCE Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neurological complications, including encephalopathy and stroke, occur in a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases but viral protein is seldom detected in the brain parenchyma. To model this situation, we developed a novel low-inoculum K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection during which active viral replication was consistently seen in mouse lungs but not in the brain. We found that several mediators previously associated with encephalopathy in clinical samples were upregulated in the lung, including CCL2, and IL-6. In addition, several inflammatory mediations, including CCL4, IFNγ, IL-17A, were upregulated in the brain, associated with microglial reactivity. Parallel in vitro experiments demonstrated that the filtered supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 virion exposed brain endothelial cells induced activation of uninfected microglia. This model successfully recreates SARS-CoV-2 virus-associated para-infectious brain inflammation which can be used to study the pathophysiology of the neurological complications and the identification of potential immune targets for treatment.">

        <tr id="The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a devastating impact. Although many survived the acute effects of the pandemic, a significant number of survivors, including those with only mild symptoms, are now experiencing a prolonged and debilitating post-viral syndrome known as LC/PASC (long COVID/post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2). Typical symptoms of LC/PASC include fatigue, breathlessness, chest pain, impaired cognition, difficulty sleeping, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Anxiety and depression can also last for weeks to months and range from mild to disabling. The association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection raises questions about the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry to the central nervous system (CNS) and long-term effects of the virus on the CNS, their molecular basis, and the potential risk of neuronal damage associated with the subsequent development of neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to global public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women. This study delves into the T cell immune responses in pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, all of whom received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Using the ELISpot assay, we measured T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and nucleocapsid peptides in two groups: those infected before and during pregnancy. Our results showed weak to moderate correlations between T cell responses and neutralizing antibody levels, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups. T cell reactivity appeared to decrease over time post-diagnosis, regardless of infection timing. Intriguingly, over half of the participants maintained detectable T cell memory responses beyond one year post-infection, suggesting the long-term persistence of cellular immunity. These insights contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 immunology in pregnant women, highlighting the importance of considering both humoral and cellular immune responses in this high-risk population.">

 The immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still under investigation. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild in the pediatric population, some children develop severe clinical manifestations or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection. MIS-C, typically emerging 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is characterized by a hyperinflammatory response affecting multiple organs. This review aims to explore the complex landscape of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, focusing on innate, T cell-, and B cell-mediated immunity, and discusses the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a superantigen in MIS-C pathophysiology. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving the management and outcomes for affected children.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the impact of viral infections on individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Initial observations suggested lower COVID-19 rates among CF populations; however, subsequent clinical data have presented a more complex scenario. This study aimed to investigate how bronchial epithelial cells from CF and non-CF individuals, including various CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, respond to in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV. Comparisons with the Influenza A virus (IAV) were included based on evidence that CF patients experience heightened morbidity from IAV infection. Our findings showed that CF epithelial cells exhibited reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of the type of CFTR mutation or SARS-CoV-2 variant, as well as the original 2003 SARS-Cove. In contrast, these cells displayed more efficient IAV replication compared to non-CF cells. Interestingly, the reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in CF was not linked to the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor nor to CFTR dysfunction, as pharmacological treatments to restore CFTR function did not normalize the viral response. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and CFTR function influenced the levels of certain cytokines and chemokines, although these effects were not correlated. Overall, this study reveals a unique viral response in CF epithelial cells, characterized by reduced replication for some viruses like SARS-CoV-2, while showing increased susceptibility to others such as IAV. This research offers a new perspective on CF and viral interactions, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these differences.

This infection model recapitulates breathing-like stretch and culture of epithelial cells at the air–liquid interface and resulted in clinically relevant cytopathic effects including cell rounding of alveolar type 2 cells and disruption of the tight junction protein occludin. Viral replication was confirmed by immunocytochemical nucleocapsid staining in the epithelium and increased shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus within 2 days post-infection, associated with changes in innate host immune responses. Together, these data demonstrate that, under the experimental conditions used in this work, this human alveolus MPS chip can successfully model SARS-CoV-2 infection of human alveolar lung cells.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The novel coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 triggered the COVID-19 pandemic with severe economic and social ramifications. As the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory system becomes more understood, growing evidence suggests that the virus also impacts the homeostasis-regulating neuroendocrine systems, potentially affecting other organ systems.


SUMMARY
This review explores the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the neuroendocrine system, highlighting the effect of this virus on various endocrine glands, including the brain, hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, pancreatic islets, gonads and adipose tissue. The viral invasion disrupts normal hormonal pathways, leading to a range of endocrine disorders, including hormonal imbalances, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances.


KEY MESSAGES
There is potential for SARS-CoV-2 to induce autoimmune responses, exacerbate existing endocrine conditions and trigger new-onset disorders. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing treatment strategies that address not only the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 but also its endocrine complications. The review emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endocrine health. .">

        <tr id="Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) impacts multiple anatomical sites. Whether this is due to the virus itself or is a secondary effect caused by the influx and activation of immune cells is not known. Positron emission tomography (PET) with immunoglobulins can provide insights into which sites and cells are activated in a living animal. Our aim is to use two nanobodies as tools to monitor (1) the distribution of antigen presenting cells (APC) by virtue of their Mafa-DR expression profile, (2) virus-infected cells and viral particles using a nanobody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Two [89Zr]-labeled nanobodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II antigens (Mafa-DR), respectively, are used to monitor their distribution during an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in a nonhuman primate model. Scans are obtained before infection and on Day 3 and 10 post infection (pi) in two macaques each. The [89Zr]anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike nanobody localized to SARS-CoV-2-associated lung lesions and the nasal mucosa, while the [89Zr]anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR nanobody was predominantly found in non-affected lung tissue after infection. We also detected, pi, upregulation of the Mafa-DR signal, indicative of recruitment of professional APCs, in the superior sagittal sinus. [89Zr]-labeled nanobodies show recruitment of macrophages/monocytes in non-lesional lung tissue in cynomolgus macaques after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as accumulation of the spike protein in both lung lesions and the nasal mucosa during infection. These results show the possibility of in vivo monitoring the quality and quantity of immune responses during the initial stages of an infection.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, triggering an acute proinflammatory response and chronic lung inflammation. Probiotic supplementation has shown promise in reducing the nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, diminishing symptom frequency and duration, and mitigating inflammation; thus, it is a potential strategy for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the oral administration of the Lactobacillus plantarum GUANKE strain, a gram-positive bacterium originally isolated from a healthy individual, on SARS-CoV-2 infection in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model. We found that GUANKE significantly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and pulmonary interstitial exudation in mice. The transcription of CCL2, TNFA, IL1B, IL6, and IL17C in the lungs was reduced. The protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 in the lungs were significantly lower in GUANKE-treated mice than in control mice. The viral load in GUANKE-treated mice was lower than that in saline-treated mice, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. L. plantarum GUANKE can decrease SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation in mice, suggesting its potential for use as an agent for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.


IMPORTANCE
Most otherwise healthy individuals develop only mild or moderate symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by current strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and virus replication is mainly confined to the upper respiratory tract; however, the virus can infect the lower respiratory tract and promote inflammation. Probiotic supplementation has been shown to reduce nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, reduce the overall number and duration of symptoms, and attenuate inflammation in clinical trials. We showed that a novel L. plantarum GUANKE strain alleviated SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia in mice. The transcription and production of inflammatory cytokines were suppressed, and GUANKE moderately reduced the viral load. L. plantarum GUANKE has the potential to become a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 or other viral respiratory infections.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infects via the respiratory tract, but COVID-19 includes an array of non-respiratory symptoms, among them gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as vomiting and diarrhea. Here we investigated the GI pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in rhesus macaques and humans. Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in GI barrier disruption that permits microbial translocation and a corresponding immune response. These findings could aid in developing interventions to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by multiorgan involvement and inflammation. Testing of cellular function ex vivo to understand the aberrant immune response in MIS-C is limited. Despite strong Ab production in MIS-C, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing can remain positive for 4-6 wk postinfection. Therefore, we hypothesized that dysfunctional cell-mediated Ab responses downstream of Ab production may be responsible for delayed clearance of viral products in MIS-C. In MIS-C, monocytes were hyperfunctional for phagocytosis and cytokine production, whereas NK cells were hypofunctional for both killing and cytokine production. The decreased NK cell cytotoxicity correlated with an NK exhaustion marker signature and systemic IL-6 levels. Potentially providing a therapeutic option, cellular engagers of CD16 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins were found to rescue NK cell function in vitro. Taken together, our results reveal dysregulation in Ab-mediated cellular responses of myeloid and NK cells that likely contribute to the immune pathology of this disease.">

Herein, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to study the binding dynamics between the virus and cell membrane. Our findings revealed that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibited a slightly stronger affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor compared with the Delta variant and was significantly higher than the wild-type (WT). Using a real-time force-tracing technique, we quantified the dynamic parameters for a single SARS-CoV-2 VLP entry into cells, showing that approximately 200 ms and 60 pN are required. The parameters aligned with the analysis obtained from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. Additionally, the Omicron variant invades cells at a higher entry cell speed, smaller force, and higher probability. Furthermore, single-particle fluorescence tracking visually demonstrated clathrin-dependent endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 entry into A549 cells. The dynamic features of endocytosis provide valuable insights into the SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and possible intervention strategies targeting the viral infection process.">

Our understanding of the pathologic changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based almost exclusively on post-mortem analyses of adults. These studies established several hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection, including diffuse alveolar damage, microvascular thrombi, and acute bronchopneumonia. We describe a fatal example of COVID pneumonia in a 9-year-old girl who presented with fever 10 months following the diagnosis of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). A chest computed tomography scan revealed left upper lobe lung consolidation and nodular airspace disease, and an initial SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (RT-PCR) was negative. A subsequent lung biopsy performed due to concern for relapsed ALCL demonstrated sheets of intra-alveolar and interstitial macrophages, and macrophage-rich fibrinous exudates. Immunohistochemical and in-situ hybridization stains confirmed these macrophages as the predominant SARS-CoV-2-infected cell type. Subsequent RT-PCR testing of upper and lower respiratory tract samples was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whole genome sequencing confirmed the presence of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. This biopsy illustrates the histopathologic features of early COVID pneumonia in antemortem lung tissue from a pediatric patient, and establishes macrophages as a potential source of SARS-CoV-2 amplification.">

 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is still a global public health concern. During March 2022, a rapid and confined single-source outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in a community in Nanjing municipal city. Overall, 95 individuals had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The whole genomes of 61 viral samples were obtained, which were all members of the BA.2.2 lineage and clearly demonstrated the presence of one large clade, and all the infections could be traced back to the original index case. The most distant sequence from the index case presented a difference of 4 SNPs, and 118 intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) at 74 genomic sites were identified. Some minor iSNVs can be transmitted and subsequently rapidly fixed in the viral population. The minor iSNVs transmission resulted in at least 2 nucleotide substitutions among all 7 SNPs identified in the outbreak, generating genetically diverse populations. We estimated the overall transmission bottleneck size to be 3 using 11 convincing donor–recipient transmission pairs. Our study provides new insights into genomic epidemiology and viral transmission, revealing how iSNVs become fixed in local clusters, followed by viral transmission across the community, which contributes to population diversity.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is linked to high mortality, primarily through an intense inflammatory response. Diacerein has emerged as a potential therapy for COVID-19 due to its potential impact in decreasing the inflammasome activation and coronavirus replication. This study aims to explore diacerein’s influence in inhibiting both viral replication and the inflammatory response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy volunteers and infected in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we carried out a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 14 participants allocated to diacerein (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) therapies every 12 h for 10 days. The primary endpoint was change in plasma markers of inflammasome activation (NLRP3, caspase-1, and gasdermin-D). Results In vitro protocols have shown that rhein, diacerein’s primary metabolite, decreased IL-1β secretion caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in human PBMCs (p < 0.05), and suppressed viral replication when administered either before or after the virus incubation (p < 0.05). This later effect was, at least partially, attributed to its inhibitory effect on 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro) and papain-like protease in the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) virus and in the phosphorylation of proteins related cytoskeleton network (p < 0.05). Diacerein-treated COVID-19 patients presented a smaller area under the curve for NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDM-D measured on days 2, 5, and 10 after hospitalization compared to those receiving a placebo (p < 0.05). Conclusion The indicated mechanisms of action of diacerein/rhein can reduce viral replication and mitigate the inflammatory response related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings are preliminary and require confirmation in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="In this study, we report on longitudinal kinetics of cellular immune subsets following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of hospitalized individuals and evaluate the interplay of these profiles with infecting viral variants, humoral immunity including neutralizing responses, vaccination history and clinical outcomes. A cohort of 121 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibiting varying disease states were prospectively evaluated for lymphopenic profiles, anti-viral humoral responses and infecting viral variants for a period of up to 90 days spanning the period, February 2021-January 2022 (2nd and 3rd waves of infection). A total of 51 participants received at least one vaccine dose of indigenous vaccines (Covishield or Covaxin) prior to recruitment. When stratified in terms of mortality, B and NK cells, in contrast to the T cell compartment, did not recover from nadir levels in non-survivors who were largely unvaccinated. No discriminatory signature was identified for non-survivors in terms of anti-NC or anti-S1-RBD IgG CLIA profiles including GenScript S1-RBD assays. Evaluation of sVCAM and sMAdCAM revealed opposing dynamics that correlated with disease severity and convalescence respectively. Viral variant analysis revealed delta and omicron variants to comprise majority of the infections which reflected national transmission kinetics during the period of recruitment. Our results demonstrate the importance of monitoring circulating biomarkers for convalescence as well as mortality in COVID-19 progression. Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 clearly demonstrated increased pathogenicity and warrants sustained viral surveillance for re-emergence of these strains. Our findings with respect to vaccination advocate for continued vaccine development and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) remain a significant global cause of mortality and disability. Viruses constitute a substantial proportion of LRTI cases, with their pandemic potential posing a latent threat. After the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the resurgence of other respiratory viruses, including Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus responsible for LRTI has been observed especially in susceptible populations.


AREAS COVERED
This review details the inflammatory mechanisms associated with three primary respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The focus will be on elucidating the activation of inflammatory pathways, understanding cellular contributions to inflammation, exploring the role of interferon and induced cell death in the response to these pathogens and detailing viral evasion mechanisms.

        <tr id="Problem COVID-19 during pregnancy is linked to increased maternal morbidity and a higher incidence of preterm births, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage (γH2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis, particularly affecting the elderly, who are more susceptible to severe outcomes. However, definitive parameters or mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in elderly people remain confused. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the mechanism behind the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals to severe COVID-19. We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry following protein extraction, digestion, and peptide labeling. We analyzed the transcriptome and proteome profiles of young and aged mice and discovered that aged mice exhibited elevated baseline levels of inflammation and tissue damage repair. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged mice showed increased antiviral and inflammatory responses; however, these responses were weaker than those in young mice, with significant complement and coagulation cascade responses. In summary, our study demonstrates that the increased vulnerability of the elderly to severe COVID-19 can be attributed to an attenuated antiviral response and the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades.">

        <tr id="Coronaviruses (CoV) emerge suddenly from animal reservoirs to cause novel diseases in new hosts. Discovered in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in camels in the Middle East and is continually causing local outbreaks and epidemics. While all three newly emerging human CoV from past 20 years (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) cause respiratory disease, each CoV has unique host interactions that drive differential pathogeneses. To better understand the virus and host interactions driving lethal MERS-CoV infection, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics analysis of sublethal and lethal MERS-CoV infection in mice. Significant differences were observed in body weight loss, virus titers and acute lung injury among lethal and sub-lethal virus doses. Virus induced apoptosis of type I and II alveolar epithelial cells suggest that loss or dysregulation of these key cell populations was a major driver of severe disease. Omics analysis suggested differential pathogenesis was multi-factorial with clear differences among innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as those that regulate lung epithelial homeostasis. Infection of mice lacking functional T and B-cells showed that adaptive immunity was important in controlling viral replication but also increased pathogenesis. In summary, we provide a high-resolution host response atlas for MERS-CoV infection and disease severity. Multi-omics studies of viral pathogenesis offer a unique opportunity to not only better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease but also to identify genes and pathways that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention all of which is important for our future pandemic preparedness. Importance Emerging coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV cause a range of disease outcomes in humans from asymptomatic, moderate and severe respiratory disease which can progress to death but the factors causing these disparate outcomes remain unclear. Understanding host responses to mild and life-threatening infection provides insight into virus-host networks within and across organ systems that contribute to disease outcomes. We used multi-omics approaches to comprehensively define the host response to moderate and severe MERS-CoV infection. Severe respiratory disease was associated with dysregulation of the immune response. Key lung epithelial cell populations that are essential for lung function get infected and die. Mice lacking key immune cell populations experienced greater virus replication but decreased disease severity implicating the immune system in both protective and pathogenic roles in the response to MERS-CoV. These data could be utilized to design new therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathways that contribute to severe disease.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transitioning from a pandemic to an endemic phase through recurring mutations. Initial efforts focused on developing strategies to mitigate infection of lung epithelial cells which are the primary targets of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the affinity of the spike protein to human ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2, however, infects additional cell types present in the lung such as macrophages through the alternate entry receptor Neuropilin 1 (NRP1). Developing novel therapeutic strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells crucial for immunosurveillance could thus be integral to treat post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Since traditional drug development process takes a long time, it is imperative to establish new strategies that can be rapidly deployed to combat the dynamic nature of COVID-19 evolution and to contribute to prevention of future pandemics. We obtained the gene expression profiles of THP-1 monocytes from L1000-based Connectivity Map using CLUE, cloud- based software platform for the analysis of perturbational datasets to identify compounds that could reduce the expression level of NRP1. Out of 33,590 compounds, we analyzed the profiles of 45 compounds for their ability to reduce NRP1 expression. We selected the top five small molecule inhibitors predicted to decrease the expression of NRP1 for validation studies. All five selected compounds showed low cytotoxicity at tested doses and their ability to reduce NRP1 surface expression was evaluated in THP-1 monocytes, THP-1-derived macrophage like cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived primary macrophages. Five compounds with the largest predicted reduction of NRP1 expression decreased macrophage NRP1 surface expression measured using flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy assays in both cell line and primary macrophages. Using our computational approach, we identified 45 compounds that could potentially decrease NRP1 surface expression in macrophages based on their effect on THP-1 monocytes. Validation studies showed that such an approach can help to identify compounds for drug repositioning in target cells that are absent in the L1000 database. Our proposed approach can be applicable for the rapid compound exploration to combat novel cell types that SARS-CoV-2 targets for infection and could provide molecular bases for the development of new drugs.">

        <tr id="Bats are tolerant to highly pathogenic viruses such as Marburg, Ebola, and Nipah, suggesting the presence of a unique immune tolerance toward viral infection. Here, we compared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of human and bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) pluripotent cells and fibroblasts. Since bat cells do not express an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that allows virus infection, we transduced the human ACE2 (hA) receptor into the cells and found that transduced cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Compared to human embryonic stem cells-hA, infected bat induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-hA produced about a 100-fold lower level of infectious virus and displayed lower toxicity. In contrast, bat embryonic fibroblast-hA produced no infectious virus while being infectable and synthesizing viral RNA and proteins, suggesting abortive infection. Indeed, electron microscopy failed to detect virus-like particles in infected bat fibroblasts in contrast to bat iPSCs or human cells, consistent with the latter producing infectious viruses. This suggests that bat somatic but not pluripotent cells have an effective mechanism to control virus replication. Consistent with previous results by others, we find that bat cells have a constitutively activated innate immune system, which might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to human cells.">

        <tr id="Despite the conclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic, the coronavirus-killing ability of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) remains impressive, and investigations into its underlying mechanisms are still ongoing. The fusion peptide (FP) is a crucial site of membrane fusion and toxicity exerted by the S-protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the interaction mechanisms of FP and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The simulation results show that the given ROS (O atoms and OH radicals as examples) can destroy hydrophobic residues, negatively charged acidic residues, and peptide bonds through structurally altering essential sites. Furthermore, the reaction typically initiates from the H-abstraction reaction, followed by various types of oxidative modifications such as dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, carbonylation, cyclogenesis, ring cleavage, and decarboxylation, which are consistent with the experimental findings made on peptides. Therefore, it can be predicted that the membrane fusion ability of FP and the toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 will be reduced, with CAP functioning as a bactericidal disinfectant. The dose effects were also investigated, providing experimental guidance for the optimization of CAP. In this study, the interaction processes of FP and CAP are explored by revealing the chemical pathways and final reaction products from the computational data, thus providing a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 by CAP.">

        <tr id="From the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, was detected in serum from patients. As a consequence, several anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Dexamethasone (a strong corticoid), were used to counteract such cytokine storm occurring during severe disease. By contrast, pro-inflammatory interleukin 11 (IL11), a member of the IL6 family, was detected in respiratory tissues from infected patients and in experimental epithelial cellular models. In this work, human A549 lung epithelial cells were individually transduced with SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs), resulting in a IL11 increase, which was significantly decreased after Dexamethasone treatment. The use of this cellular platform allowed us to screen for new possible anti-inflammatory compounds from Fasciola hepatica. Our results highlighted the ability of FhNEJ (Fasciola hepatica newly excysted juvenile flukes) somatic extract to decrease IL11 levels in ORF-transduced cells. These results emphasized the role of IL11 in lung epithelial inflammation, making it a potential target for future treatments of lung inflammation which occurs in COVID-19, and validate the use of these ORF-expressing cells as a cellular platform to test anti-inflammatory compounds for COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="The primary challenge posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is COVID-19-related mortality, often exacerbated by additional medical complications, such as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Up to half of COVID-19 patients experience kidney complications, with those facing acute respiratory failure and kidney injury having the worst overall prognosis. Despite the significant impact of CAKI on COVID-19-related mortality and its enduring effects in long COVID, the underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of CAKI remain elusive. In this study, we identified a functional relationship between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein and inflammation-driven apoptotic death of renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with CAKI. We demonstrate in vitro that ORF3a independently induces renal cell-specific apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the elevation of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and the activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-6) production. By examining kidney tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-ACE2 transgenic mice, we observed a similar correlation between ORF3a-induced cytopathic changes and kidney injury. This correlation was further validated through reconstitution of the ORF3a effects via direct adenoviral injection into mouse kidneys. Through medicinal analysis, we identified a natural compound, glycyrrhizin (GL4419), which not only blocks viral replication in renal cells, but also mitigates ORF3a-induced renal cell death by inhibiting activation of a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, leading to a reduction of KIM-1. Moreover, ORF3a interacts with HMGB1. Overproduction or downregulation of hmgb1 expression results in correlative changes in renal cellular KIM-1 response and respective cytokine production, implicating a crucial role of HMGB1 in ORF3a-inflicted kidney injuries. Our data suggest a direct functional link between ORF3a and kidney injury, highlighting ORF3a as a unique therapeutic target contributing to CAKI.


IMPORTANCE
The major challenge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the pandemic is COVID-19-related mortality, which has tragically claimed millions of lives. COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are often exacerbated by pre-existing medical conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), or the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, collectively known as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Patients who experience acute respiratory failure with CAKI have the poorest clinical outcomes, including increased mortality. Despite these alarming clinical findings, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying causes of CAKI. Our study establishes a direct correlation between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral ORF3a protein and kidney injury induced by ORF3a linking to CAKI. This functional relationship was initially observed in our clinical studies of COVID-19 patients with AKI and was further validated through animal and in vitro cellular studies, either by expressing ORF3a alone or in the context of viral infection. By elucidating this functional relationship and its underlying mechanistic pathways, our research deepens the understanding of COVID-19-associated kidney diseases and presents potential therapeutic avenues to address the healthcare challenges faced by individuals with underlying conditions.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented global challenges with a diverse clinical spectrum, including severe respiratory complications and systemic effects. This review explores the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and obesity in COVID-19. Mitochondria are vital for cellular energy provision and resilience against age-related macromolecule damage accumulation. They manage energy allocation in cells, activating adaptive responses and stress signals such as redox imbalance and innate immunity activation. As organisms age, mitochondrial function diminishes. Aging and obesity, linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, compromise the antiviral response, affecting the release of interferons, and worsening COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID has been associated with altered energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation derived from mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the interplay between mitochondria, aging, obesity, and viral infections provides insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. Targeting mitochondrial health may offer potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate severe outcomes and address long-term consequences in infected individuals.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat to public health globally. Infection in some susceptible individuals causes life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI/ARDS) and/or death. Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a C-type lectin expressed in the lung and other mucosal tissues, and it plays a critical role in host defense against various pathogens. The human SP-A genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) are highly polymorphic and comprise several common genetic variants, i.e., SP-A1 (variants 6A2, 6A4) and SP-A2 (variants 1A0, 1A3). Here, we elucidated the differential antiviral and immunoregulatory roles of SP-A variants in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Six genetically-modified mouse lines, expressing both hACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and individual SP-A variants: (hACE2/6A2 (6A2), hACE2/6A4 (6A4), hACE2/1A0 (1A0), and hACE2/1A3(1A3), one SP-A knockout (hACE2/SP-A KO (KO) and one hACE2/mouse SP-A (K18) mice, were challenged intranasally with 103 PFU SARS-CoV-2 or saline (Sham). Infected KO and 1A0 mice had more weight loss and mortality compared to other mouse lines. Relative to other infected mouse lines, a more severe ALI was observed in KO, 1A0, and 6A2 mice. Reduced viral titers were generally observed in the lungs of infected SP-A mice relative to KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation in genes that play central roles in immune responses such as MyD88, Stat3, IL-18, and Jak2 in the lungs of KO and 1A0 mice. However, Mapk1 was significantly downregulated in 6A2 versus 1A0 mice. Analysis of biological pathways identified those involved in lung host defense and innate immunity, including pathogen-induced cytokine, NOD1/2, and Trem1 signaling pathways. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, levels of cytokines and chemokines such as G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-1β were comparatively higher in the lungs and sera of KO and 1A0 mice with the highest mortality rate. These findings demonstrate that human SP-A variants differentially modulate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and disease severity by differentially inhibiting viral infectivity and regulating immune-related gene expressions.">

        <tr id="JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infects the majority of the population and initially establishes a persistent but asymptomatic infection of the kidneys. In healthy individuals, the infection remains controlled by the host immune system, but for individuals experiencing prolonged immunosuppression, the infection can reactivate and spread to the brain, where it causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Currently, there are no approved therapies to treat PML, and affected individuals suffer rapid motor weakness and cognitive deterioration. To identify novel therapeutic treatments for JCPyV infection, receptor agonists/antagonists identified in a previously published drug screen were evaluated for their antiviral properties. Seven drugs were selected and validated using infectivity assays, and the mechanism of inhibition was further explored for G protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-associated inhibitors due to the role of the GPCR 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) in JCPyV entry. The inhibitors cetirizine and paroxetine both reduced infection early in the JCPyV infectious cycle. Paroxetine specifically reduced viral internalization through altering the receptor density of 5-HT2CR, inhibiting β-arrestin recruitment to the receptor, and reducing MAPK signaling through ERK. These findings highlight the potential of receptor signaling and viral entry mechanisms as possible targets for antiviral drug development. Further, this research suggests that FDA-approved receptor agonists/antagonists currently used to treat other medical conditions could be repurposed into antivirals for the possible treatment of JCPyV infection and the fatal disease PML.">

        <tr id="Abstract Many mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection involve expression of the human ACE2 protein, the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, in mouse tissues. However, most of these models suffer from nonphysiological regulation of ACE2 expression, which can lead to atypically severe infections and aberrant sites of viral replication. In this report, we developed and characterized an ACE2 gene replacement (ACE2-GR) mouse strain in which the mouse Ace2 genomic locus was replaced by the entire human ACE2 gene locus, and we investigated the ability of these animals to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that ACE2-GR mice support SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, but, in stark contrast to the widely used K18-hACE2 transgenic model, this infection leads to a mild disease with no detectable involvement of the CNS. Thus, ACE2-GR mice provide a novel, to our knowledge, model to explore immune responses and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung has been extensively studied, the molecular regulators and targets of the host-cell programs hijacked by the virus in distinct human airway epithelial cell populations remain poorly understood. This is in part ascribed to the use of non-primary cell systems, overreliance on single-cell gene expression profiling that not ultimately reflect protein activity and bias toward the downstream effects rather than their mechanistic determinants. Here we address these issues by network-based analysis of single cell transcriptomic profiles of pathophysiologically relevant human adult basal, ciliated and secretory cells to identify master regulator (MR) protein modules controlling their SARS-CoV-2-mediated reprogramming. This uncovered chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathway as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR analyses as components of the host response collectively or selectively activated in these cells. Large-scale perturbation assays, using a clinically-relevant drug library, identified 11 drugs able to invert the entire MR signature activated by SARS-CoV-2 in these cell types. Leveraging MR analysis and perturbational profiles of human primary cells, represents a novel mechanism-based approach and resource that can be directly generalized to interrogate signatures of other airway conditions for drug prioritization.">

        <tr id="While the World Health Organization has declared the end of the SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency, studies related to corona viruses are still under course. As of 2024, the severity of COVID-19 has diminished with current treatments and vaccinations. However, individuals can still face severe complications, highlighting the importance of ongoing research into innovative treatments for current and future coronavirus-related diseases. This study approaches the mechanism of viral entrance into the host cells and the current evidence on the use of sulfhydryl groups for the COVID-19 treatment. Certain thiol drugs, a key contributor to inflammatory processes, exhibit both viral inhibition properties and the potential to regulate cellular oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. Herein, we developed biocompatible thiol-functionalized carbon dots (CDs) and investigated the correlation between the number of thiols and pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and anti-inflammatory response. The free-radical scavenging experiment and the ROS cellular assay indicate that thiolated CDs serve as effective reducing agents and potential regulators of cellular oxidative stress. The CDs also demonstrated good cell viability alongside significant antiviral capabilities, with inhibition levels up to 60.4%. Furthermore, the flow cytometry results suggest that in an inflammatory environment, the presence of thiolated CDs promotes an anti-inflammatory response. Overall, the results demonstrate a strong correlation between the number of thiols and the increased efficacy observed across experiments, presenting thiolated CDs as promising candidates to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Mucosal barrier integrity is vital for homeostasis with commensal organisms while preventing pathogen invasion. We unexpectedly found that fungal-induced immunosurveillance enhances resistance to fungal outgrowth and tissue invasion by remodeling the oral mucosal epithelial barrier in mouse models of adult and neonatal Candida albicans colonization. Epithelial subset expansion and tissue remodeling were dependent on interleukin-22 (IL-22) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, through a non-canonical receptor complex composed of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) coupled with IL-22RA1 and IL-10RB. Immunosurveillance-induced epithelial remodeling was restricted to the oral mucosa, whereas barrier architecture was reset once fungal-specific immunity developed. Collectively, these findings identify fungal-induced transient mucosal remodeling as a critical determinant of resistance to mucosal fungal infection during early stages of microbial colonization.">

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, advanced age has emerged as a major predictor of disease severity. Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19. Author summary In this study, we investigated why older age is linked to more severe COVID-19 outcomes by comparing the progression of the disease in young (2 months) and elderly (15-22 months) K18(hACE2) mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. After exposing both groups to the virus, we assessed various factors such as viral loads, immune responses, and lipid profiles in the lungs at different time points. Our findings revealed that elderly mice struggled to clear the virus by day 7 post-infection, leading to higher mortality rates and poorer recovery compared to younger mice. Aged mice showed weaker immune responses, with reduced production of key antiviral proteins like IFNg and certain chemokines. Lipid analysis also highlighted differences in molecules involved in immune regulation and lung protection, such as decreased levels of pro-resolving lipids and increased lipids associated with lung injury. These results suggest that older mice have a compromised antiviral defense, which could inform new therapeutic approaches for elderly patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may have diminished serologic response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination and increased risk for subsequent severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We sought to describe outcomes among those who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination, characterize SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 1 year post-vaccination, and identify factors associated with durable serologic response.


METHODS
We recruited children with IBD who received ≥2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and prospectively collected data on (1) demographics, IBD characteristics, and therapy and (2) SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, testing, and infection symptoms. Serum was obtained for measurement of anti-receptor-binding domain IgG antibodies following a 2-part immunization at 12 and 52 weeks.


RESULTS
We enrolled 298 participants (mean age 11.9 ± 3.82, 50% female, 67% Crohn's disease). Symptomatic COVID-19 infection after vaccination occurred in half of the participants, although only 2 (1%) required hospitalization. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was associated with higher likelihood of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5-5.0; P = .001). Nearly all participants (99%) had detectable antibody at Week 52. Children aged 1-5 years had lower 52-week antibody level compared to older children (P = .04), as did those on anti-TNF-α therapy (P = .007) and those who received only 2 vaccine doses prior to Week 52 (P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provides lasting serologic response and protection against severe COVID-19 for most children with IBD, despite the use of lower vaccine doses in younger children and wide-ranging classes of immunosuppressive therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cutaneous mycobacterial infections cause substantial morbidity and are challenging to diagnose and treat. An improved understanding of the dermal immune response to mycobacteria may inspire new therapeutic approaches. We conducted a controlled human infection study with 10 participants who received 2 × 106 CFUs of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (Tice strain) intradermally and were randomized to receive isoniazid or no treatment. Peripheral blood was collected at multiple time points for flow cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and serum Ab assessments. Systemic immune responses were detected as early as 8 d postchallenge in this M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin–naive population. Injection-site skin biopsies were performed at days 3 and 15 postchallenge and underwent immune profiling using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq, as well as quantitative assessments of bacterial viability and burden. Molecular viability testing and standard culture results correlated well, although no differences were observed between treatment arms. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed various immune and nonimmune cell types in the skin, and communication between them was inferred by ligand-receptor gene expression. Day 3 communication was predominantly directed toward monocytes from keratinocyte, muscle, epithelial, and endothelial cells, largely via the migration inhibitory factor pathway and HLA-E–KLRK1 interaction. At day 15, communication was more balanced between cell types. These data reveal the potential role of nonimmune cells in the dermal immune response to mycobacteria and the utility of human challenge studies to augment our understanding of mycobacterial infections.">

COVID-19 is caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus from the Coronaviridae family, responsible
for developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). Its emergence in 2019
presented several challenges to global health. The virus can infect host cells using the ACE2 receptor,
and after infection, several clinical manifestations appear, ranging from mild symptoms to death.
One approach that has shown promising results is convalescent plasma since convalescent plasma
(CP) consists of a concentrate of immunoglobulins in the blood of patients recently infected with the
coronavirus for those currently infected. Therefore, this therapy uses antibodies in the plasma to
neutralize the virus. This literature review aims to evaluate the efficacy of CP therapy in symptomatic
COVID-19 patients by analyzing clinical trials and studies published between 2020 and 2023.
Therefore, the search identified studies in which the majority reported the efficacy of using convalescent
plasma to treat and alleviate the clinical condition of patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
Important factors influence the efficacy of CP therapy, such as the timing of administration and the
severity of the disease. Early administration in mild and moderate cases has shown promise. Furthermore,
molecular docking analysis suggests that antibodies can cause conformational changes in
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, raising the hypothesis that using CP may interfere with viral entry
into host cells.

        <tr id="Background. Currently, the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute damage to organs and systems caused by coronavirus infection have been studied quite fully, but the mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of long COVID have not yet been accurately described. The mechanisms of persistence of a number of symptoms in patients who have had COVID-19 and the role of systemic inflammation and endotoxemia markers in it remain a understudied aspect and a promising direction for further studying.The aim of the study. To assess the markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability and endothelial dysfunction in patients with long COVID at the stage of health resort treatment.Methods. The study included 32 patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection and were undergoing health resort treatment in the pulmonology department of the I.M. Sechenov Academic Research Institute for Physical Therapy, Medical Climatology and Rehabilitation. We also selected a control group (n = 20). All patients underwent peripheral blood analysis to detect the levels of markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability, endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstrictor agents: C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LPB), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), zonulin, bactericidal/ permeability-increasing protein (BPI), vasopressors of angiotensin 2 and endothelin (EDN1).Results. Patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection had a statistically significant increase in the levels of CRP (3.4 [2.56; 4.0] mg/l), LBP (18.46 [14.0; 25.5] ng/ml), tPA (0.07 [0.02; 0.32] ng/ml), angiotensin 2 (133.3 [63.0; 503.7] pg/ml) and a decrease in the level of BPI (1576 [276; 3588] pg/ml) (p < 0.05).Conclusion. A statistically significant increase in markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxinemia, and vasoconstrictor agents in patients with long COVID indicates an imbalance in endotoxin-binding and endotoxin-releasing systems in patients who have had coronavirus infection. Further study of the described markers is necessary to improve approaches to long-term personalized therapy for this category of patients.">

Here we show that the activation status of the transcription factor Nrf2 in endothelial cells is a critical regulator of this process. We found that peripheral inflammation caused infiltration of macrophages, microglial activation and inflammatory reactive astrogliosis, all of which could be prevented by RTA-404, an activator of the transcription factor Nrf2 and close structural relative of the recently FDA-approved Nrf2 activator RTA-408 (Omaveloxolone). To identify the key cellular mediator(s), we generated an endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 knockout mouse. Strikingly, the effects of RTA-404 on brain endothelial activation and downstream neuroinflammatory events was abolished by endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 deletion. This places endothelial cell Nrf2 as a peripherally accessible therapeutic target to reduce the CNS-adverse consequences of systemic inflammation.">

        <tr id="While several viral infections have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the mechanism(s) through which they promote disease has remained almost entirely elusive. This study investigated the impact of common, acute viral infections prior to disease onset on ALS progression in the SOD1G93A mouse model. A single sublethal infection prior to onset of ALS clinical signs was associated with markedly accelerated ALS disease progression characterized by rapid loss of hindlimb function. Prior infection resulted in gliosis in the lumbar spine and upregulation of transcriptional pathways involved in inflammatory responses, metabolic dysregulation, and muscular dysfunction. Therapeutic suppression of gliosis with an anti-inflammatory small molecule, or administration of a direct-acting antiviral, was associated with significantly improved ALS clinical signs, akin to what was observed in uninfected animals. This study provides causal and mechanistic evidence that the immune response elicited by acute viral infections may be an important etiological factor that alters ALS disease trajectory, and provides insight into novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for ALS.

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), continuously monitor the parenchyma and surrounding borders and are the primary responders to brain damage. CD300f is a lipid-sensing immunoreceptor present in the microglial cell membrane, which binds to phosphatidylserine and other lipid mediators. Defining the functional microglial sensome is critical to understand their function and cell state determination. Using intravital two-photon microscopy we show that microglia lacking the CD300f receptor fail to detect environmental damage cues after a laser ablation injury. After a mild traumatic brain injury or after the intracortical injection of apoptotic cells, CD300f-/- microglia showed reduced capacity for detecting and phagocytosing dyeing cells, leading to the accumulation of dead cells in the neural parenchyma. Moreover, at later timepoints, increased accumulation of dyeing cells was found inside CD300f-/- microglia in vivo and in bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, suggesting that these cells display a reduced capacity for metabolizing phagocytosed cells. Finally, CD300f deficiency increased functional compromise after a contusive traumatic brain injury, associated to increased conservation of brain tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that CD300f function as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptor that coordinates microglial process reaction towards tissue debris and highlights its central role in microglial sensome machinery and in the modulation of in vivo microglial efferocytosis.">

However, mechanisms of paralysis are unclear, and antiviral therapies are lacking. To better understand EV-D68 disease, we inoculated newborn mice intracranially to assess viral tropism, virulence, and immune responses. Wild-type (WT) mice inoculated intracranially with a neurovirulent strain of EV-D68 showed infection of spinal cord neurons and developed paralysis. Spinal tissue from infected mice revealed increased levels of chemokines, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and T cells relative to controls, suggesting that immune cell infiltration influences pathogenesis. To define the contribution of cytokine-mediated immune cell recruitment to disease, we inoculated mice lacking CCR2, a receptor for several EV-D68-upregulated cytokines, or RAG1, which is required for lymphocyte maturation. WT, Ccr2-/-, and Rag1-/- mice had comparable viral titers in spinal tissue. However, Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice had significantly less paralysis relative to WT mice. Consistent with impaired T cell recruitment to sites of infection in Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice, antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from WT mice diminished paralysis. These results indicate that immune cell recruitment to the spinal cord promotes EV-D68-associated paralysis and illuminate new targets for therapeutic intervention. Graphical Abstract">

We investigated whether the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 affected the dynamics of fecal microbial composition isolated in culture in moderate COVID-19 patients. Blood, stool, and medical records were collected from 50 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two samples were taken per patient, at disease onset (within 5 days) and after symptom resolution (30–35 days). The part of the gut microbiota identifiable using MALDI-TOF MS was analyzed, and inflammatory cytokines and blood markers were measured in serum. The analysis identified 566 isolates at the species level, including 83 bacterial and 9 fungal species. Our findings indicate a change in the gut microbiota composition isolated in culture during the initial phase of infection, characterized by the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria such as Enterococcus spp. and Citrobacter spp., at the expense of beneficial commensal bacteria from the genus Bacillus and Lactobacillus. Additionally, the enrichment of fungal pathogens in fecal samples collected 30 days after the cessation of disease symptoms might suggest a prolonged disruption of the gut microbiota even after the resolution of COVID-19 symptoms.

        <tr id="MPOX virus (MPXV), formerly known as monkeypox virus, led to a rapidly evolving pandemic starting May 2022, with over 90,000 cases reported beyond the African continent. This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of IFN-α2a. qPCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-α2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced amounts of viral antigen production and of released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohematogenous route for replication and/or intra-host dissemination.">

This study aimed to identify potentially immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides and to explore the intricate host–pathogen interactions involving peripheral immune responses, memory profiles, and various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Using in silico and experimental methods, we identified several CD8-restricted SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are either poorly studied or have previously unreported immunogenicity: fifteen from the Spike and three each from non-structural proteins Nsp1-2-3-16. A Spike peptide, LA-9, demonstrated a 57% response rate in ELISpot assays using PBMCs from 14 HLA-A*02:01 positive, vaccinated, and mild-COVID-19 recovered subjects, indicating its potential for diagnostics, research, and multi-epitope vaccine platforms. We also found that younger individuals, with fewer vaccine doses and longer intervals since infection, showed lower anti-Spike (ELISA) and anti-Wuhan neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus assay), higher naïve T cells, and lower central memory, effector memory, and CD4hiCD8low T cells (flow cytometry) compared to older subjects.

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), characterized by debilitating symptoms like persistent fatigue, cardiovascular symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.">

        <tr id="Purpose. A virus, when it infects a host organism, multiplies its ribonucleic acid (RNA) to make it more harmful. We analyze if a view-based temporal template method, the motion history image (MHI) algorithm, may be of use to extract information on the progression of viral interactions over time. Methods. We employ an alternative online processing modality to comprehend and analyze the replication dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The data are evaluated using the computation of a quantitative algorithm, the absolute value of differences (AVD), followed by the generation of temporal template map, the MHI of viral contact. Results. We show that the MHI identifies various stages to examine cultural characteristics and information on the progression of viral interactions over time. The results are more easily obtained compared to a visual inspection of the frames constituting the recordings. MHI also has the advantage of relying on a simple algorithm. The AVD index further provides deeper insights into the dynamics of the viral interaction over time, and its measurement suggests that SARS CoV-2 virus is becoming more widespread. This study shows that the replication process damages the host cell over time, in addition to causing SARS CoV-2 to proliferate. Conclusions. The MHI provides a framework for automated feature extraction from time series data. The combined approach results in decreased computational complexity and enables online assessment of the assay. Clinical and research studies can be conducted to evaluate MHI and AVD and their utility in aiding diagnostic analysis.">

        <tr id="Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis and meningitis are potential central nervous system (CNS) complications following primary VZV infection or reactivation. With Type-I interferon (IFN) signalling being an important first line cellular defence mechanism against VZV infection by the peripheral tissues, we here investigated the triggering of innate immune responses in a human neural-like environment. For this, we established and characterised 5-month matured hiPSC-derived neurospheroids (NSPHs) containing neurons and astrocytes. Subsequently, NSPHs were infected with reporter strains of VZV (VZVeGFP-ORF23) or Sendai virus (SeVeGFP), with the latter serving as an immune-activating positive control. Live cell and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated VZVeGFP-ORF23 infection throughout the NSPHs, while SeVeGFP infection was limited to the outer NSPH border. Next, NanoString digital transcriptomics revealed that SeVeGFP-infected NSPHs activated a clear Type-I IFN response, while this was not the case in VZVeGFP-ORF23-infected NSPHs. Moreover, the latter displayed a strong suppression of genes related to IFN signalling and antigen presentation, as further demonstrated by suppression of IL-6 and CXCL10 production, failure to upregulate Type-I IFN activated anti-viral proteins (Mx1, IFIT2 and ISG15), as well as reduced expression of CD74, a key-protein in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. Finally, even though VZVeGFP-ORF23-infection seems to be immunologically ignored in NSPHs, its presence does result in the formation of stress granules upon long-term infection, as well as disruption of cellular integrity within the infected NSPHs. Concluding, in this study we demonstrate that 5-month matured hiPSC-derived NSPHs display functional innate immune reactivity towards SeV infection, and have the capacity to recapitulate the strong immune evasive behaviour towards VZV.">

        <tr id="In EAE, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, immunization with MOG autoantigen results in the generation of Th1/Th17 T cells in the periphery. MOG-specific T cells then invade into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuronal demyelination. Microglia, innate immune cells in the CNS are known to regulate various neuronal diseases. However, the role of microglia in EAE has remained elusive. BRD4 is a BET protein expressed in microglia, whether BRD4 in microglia contributes to EAE has not been determined. We show that EAE pathology was markedly reduced with microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout (cKO). In these mice, microglia- T cell interactions were greatly reduced, leading to the lack of T cell reactivation. Microglia specific transcriptome data showed downregulation of genes required for interaction with and reactivation of T cells in Brd4 cKO samples. In summary, BRD4 plays a critical role in regulating microglia function in normal and EAE CNS. Summary This study demonstrates that in a EAE model, microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were defective in expressing genes required for microglia- T cells interaction and those involved in neuroinflammation, and demyelination resulting in fewer CNS T cell invasion and display marked reduction in EAE pathology.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 include several comorbidities, but age was the most striking one since elderly people were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the reasons for this markedly unfavorable response in the elderly, immunosenescence and inflammaging appear as major drivers of this outcome. A finding that was also notable was that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 have an accumulation of senescent T cells, suggesting that immunosenescence may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present work was designed to examine whether these immunosenescence changes are characteristic of COVID-19 and whether it is dependent on disease severity using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our cross-sectional data show that COVID-19, but not other respiratory infections, rapidly increased cellular senescence and exhaustion in CD4 and CD8 T cells during early infection. In addition, longitudinal analyses with patients from Brazil and Portugal provided evidence of increased frequencies of senescent and exhausted T cells over a 7-d period in patients with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, the study suggests that accelerated immunosenescence in CD4 and especially CD8 T-cell compartments may represent a common and unique outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses replicate in both the cooler, upper portions of the airway and the warmer, lower portions of the respiratory tract. This study investigates how physiological ranges of temperature, specifically 33°C and 37°C, impact host cell biology and how temperature-dependent differences in host cells influence outcomes during influenza A virus infection. This study prioritizes describing mitochondrial networks due to their importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and mediating immune responses to viral infection. The temperature at which cells are incubated significantly influences mitochondrial network morphology and mitochondrial function. Moreover, temperature-dependent changes to mitochondrial networks prior to infection result in temperature-specific changes to host cell outcomes during infection. These findings indicate that mitochondrial structure alone can modulate host cell outcomes during viral infection and that both the form and function of mitochondria directly impact influenza A virus production. While not all mitochondrial processes were shown to be affected by temperature or infection, these results highlight the importance of using physiologically relevant temperatures in respiratory pathogen research and elucidate how mitochondrial dynamics contribute to host cell outcomes during influenza A virus infection. Importance Respiratory viruses infect the upper and lower respiratory tract but rarely is the impact of physiological ranges of temperature (33°C to 37°C) considered. Mitochondria are central mediators of numerous physiological pathways, and their functions are often modified by virus infection. Physiological ranges of temperature can alter mitochondrial form and function, which is further impacted by virus infection. The study sheds light on how temperature can impact mitochondrial form and function in concert with virus infection.">

        <tr id="This editorial aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between vitamin D and viral pathogenesis. It explores the anticipated role of vitamin D as a modulator in the immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other viral pathogens. The editorial comments are based on the review article by Engin et al . The potential role of vitamin D in modulating immune responses has been highlighted by several studies, suggesting that it may influence both the risk and severity of infections. Vitamin D receptors are present in immunocompetent cells, which indicates that vitamin D can potentially modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. This context is relevant in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), where the immune response to the virus can significantly impact the disease progression and outcome. The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses. It also maintains the integrity of the body's physical barriers and modulates inflammatory responses, thereby preventing entry and replication of the virus. Many studies have suggested that adequate vitamin D levels help alleviate morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation has been linked with a lower risk of severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those with a deficiency during seasons with less sunlight exposure.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune dysregulation and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia have been implicated in fatal COVID-19 disease. However, how these two factors interact to shape disease outcomes is unclear.


METHODS
We carried out viral and immunological phenotyping on a prospective cohort of 280 patients with COVID-19 presenting to acute care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts and Genoa, Italy between June 1, 2020 and February 8, 2022. Disease severity, mortality, plasma viremia, and immune dysregulation were assessed. A mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection was used to analyze the therapeutic potential of Notch4 and pyroptosis inhibition in disease outcome.


RESULTS
Stratifying patients based on %Notch4+ Treg cells and/or the presence of plasma viremia identified four subgroups with different clinical trajectories and immune phenotypes. Patients with both high %Notch4+ Treg cells and viremia suffered the most disease severity and 90-day mortality compared to the other groups even after adjusting for baseline comorbidities. Increased Notch4 and plasma viremia impacted different arms of the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased Notch4 was associated with decreased Treg cell amphiregulin expression and suppressive function whereas plasma viremia was associated with increased monocyte cell pyroptosis. Combinatorial therapies using Notch4 blockade and pyroptosis inhibition induced stepwise protection against mortality in a mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection.


CONCLUSIONS
The clinical trajectory and survival outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is predicated on two cardinal factors in disease pathogenesis: viremia and Notch4+ Treg cells. Intervention strategies aimed at resetting the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 by antagonizing Notch4 and pyroptosis may be effective in severe cases of viral lung infection.">

        <tr id="Antibody responses induced by current vaccines for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 often lack robust cross-reactivity. As hubs where diverse immune cells converge and interact, the alterations in the immune microenvironment within lymph nodes (LNs) are intricately linked to immune responses. Herein, we designed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) loaded with circular RNA (circRNA) and targeted to LNs, in which CXCL13 was directly integrated into antigen-encoding circRNA strands. We demonstrated that CXCL13 alters the transcriptomic profiles of LNs, especially the upregulation of IL-21 and IL-4. Meanwhile, CXCL13 promotes the formation of germinal center and elicits robust antigen-specific T cell responses. With the codelivery of CXCL13 and the antigen, CXCL13 enhances cross-reactive antibodies against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, achieving protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges in a mouse model. Notably, the targeted modification of LNP surfaces with antibodies helps address some of the challenges associated with lyophilized LNP vaccines, which is crucial for the long-term storage of LNP-circRNA vaccines. Overall, the circRNA-based antigen-CXCL13 coexpression system developed herein provides a simple and robust platform that enhances the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses against multiple viral glycoproteins, highlighting the potential utility of CXCL13 in inducing broad immune responses.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide ∼5 years since the first documented case. Severe COVID-19 is widely considered to be caused by a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 within the respiratory tract. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged 4-6 month old C57BL/6 mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice 4 days post infection and before death were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in the lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neutrophilia occurs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and is predictive of poor outcomes. Here, we link heterogenous neutrophil populations to disease severity in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils with features of cellular aging and immunosuppressive capacity in mild COVID-19 and features of neutrophil immaturity and activation in severe disease. The low-density neutrophil (LDN) number in circulating blood correlated with COVID-19 severity. Many of the divergent neutrophil phenotypes in COVID-19 were overrepresented in the LDN fraction and were less detectable in normal-density neutrophils. Functionally, neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed defects in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species production. Soluble factors secreted by neutrophils from these patients inhibited T cell proliferation. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of arginase-1 protein, a feature that was retained in convalescent patients. Despite this increase in intracellular expression, there was a reduction in arginase-1 release by neutrophils into serum and culture supernatants. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated T cell suppression was independent of arginase-1. Our results indicate the presence of dysfunctional, activated, and immature neutrophils in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased dramatically in recent years, affecting millions of people worldwide. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients is respiratory illness. However, the disease can also significantly impact the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. ACE-2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a crucial role in regulating various pathological processes. The interaction of the virus with ACE-2 in the myocardium can lead to direct heart damage. Several mechanisms may contribute to myocardial damage in COVID-19 patients, including systemic inflammation, myocardial interstitial fibrosis, interferon-mediated immune response, exaggerated cytokine response, T-cell-mediated damage, coronary plaque instability, and hypoxia. There has been concern that ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 by upregulating ACE-2 expression. However, it may be advisable to continue medications for patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders. The precise mechanisms of cardiomyocyte injury in COVID-19 are not fully understood, but necroptosis appears to play a significant role. Current treatments for cardiac damage in COVID-19 patients include IL-6 blockers and antiplatelet therapy. Ponatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed using computational and structural approaches, has shown the potential to affect cell death through its impact on tyrosine kinase activity. By reviewing studies related to ponatinib's effects on necroptosis and cell death, we propose a novel approach to potentially reduce the cardiotoxic effects of COVID-19 on cardiomyocytes. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of cardiac injury in COVID-19 and to develop targeted therapies to protect the heart from the devastating effects of this disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT We previously demonstrated that the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients were filled with a clear hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan (HA). In this translational study, we investigated the role of HA at all stages of COVID-19 disease to map the consequences of elevated HA on morbidity and identify the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced HA production. A reduced alveolar surface area was observed in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, as visualized by a 3D rendering of lung morphology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed the presence of HA in lung biopsies and found large quantities of proinflammatory fragmented HA. The association of systemic HA in blood plasma and disease severity was assessed in patients with mild (WHO Clinical Progression Scale, WHO-CPS, 1–5) and severe COVID-19 (WHO-CPS, 6–9) during the acute and convalescent phases and related to lung function. We found that systemic levels of HA were high during acute COVID-19 disease, remained elevated during convalescence, and were associated with a reduced diffusion capacity. In vitro 3D-lung models, differentiated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells, were used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HA metabolism, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of HA synthases and hyaluronidases, both contributing to increased HA in apical secretions. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment reduced the inflammation and downregulated HA synthases. Our findings demonstrate that HA plays a role in COVID-19 morbidity and that sustained elevated HA concentrations may contribute to long-term respiratory impairment. IMPORTANCE This study provides insights into the role of hyaluronan (HA) in the severity and long-term impact of COVID-19 on lung function. Through extensive morphological examination of lung tissues and a multicenter study, we identified that HA levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with a reduced lung diffusion capacity during convalescence. Using a 3D-lung model, we further uncovered how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a dysregulated HA metabolism, leading to increased HA production. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting HA metabolism could offer new therapeutic avenues for managing COVID-19, particularly to prevent long-term lung impairment. Additionally, HA holds potential as a biomarker for predicting disease severity, which could guide personalized treatment strategies.">

Given that the activity of neutrophils has not been described in these patients, we aimed to investigate the function of neutrophils at ICU admission and on Day 7 (D7) post admission. Neutrophil maturation and several functional indicators were investigated. We detected a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species production at D7, but we did not observe any other significant alterations in neutrophil function. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from patients displayed no inhibitory effect on the function of neutrophils from healthy donors. These findings indicate that patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS do not acquire neutrophil dysfunction within the first week of their stay, which suggests that nosocomial infections among these patients are not due to acquired neutrophil dysfunctions.">

        <tr id="mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines have played a critical role in reducing severe outcomes of COVID-19. Humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination have been extensively studied in blood; however, limited information is available on the presence and duration of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in saliva and other mucosal fluids. Saliva offers a non-invasive sampling method that may also provide a better understanding of mucosal immunity at sites where the virus enters the body. Our objective was to evaluate the salivary immune response after vaccination with the COVID-19 Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. Two hundred three staff members of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were enrolled prior to receiving their first dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Participants were asked to self-collect 6 saliva specimens at days 0 (prior to first dose), 14, 28 (prior to second dose), 42, and 56 using a SalivaBio saliva collection device. Saliva specimens were tested for anti-spike protein SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG enzyme immunoassays. Overall, SARS-CoV-2-specific salivary IgA titers peaked 2 weeks after each vaccine dose, followed by a sharp decrease during the following weeks. In contrast to IgA titers, IgG antibody titers increased substantially 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose, peaked 2 weeks after the second dose and persisted at an elevated level until at least 8 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Additionally, no significant differences in IgA/IgG titers were observed based on age, sex, or race/ethnicity. All participants mounted salivary IgA and IgG immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 after receiving the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. Because of the limited follow-up time for this study, more data are needed to assess the antibody levels beyond 2 months after the first dose. Our results confirm the potential utility of saliva in assessing immune responses elicited by immunization and possibly by infection.">

The major integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), a heterodimer consisting of CD11b and CD18 chains, is expressed in multiple immune cells of the myeloid lineage. Here, we examined the effects of CD11b gene ablation in neuroinflammation and functional outcomes after SCI. qPCR analysis of C57BL/6 female mice showed upregulation of CD11b mRNA starting from 1 d after injury, which persisted up to 28 d. CD11b knockout (KO) mice and their wildtype littermates were subjected to moderate SCI. At 1 d post-injury, qPCR showed increased expression of genes involved with inflammation-resolving processes in CD11b KO mice. Flow cytometry analysis of CD45intLy6C−CX3CR1+ microglia, CD45hiLy6C+Ly6G− monocytes, and CD45hiLy6C+Ly6G+ neutrophils revealed significantly reduced cell counts as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in CD11b KO mice at d3 post-injury. Further examination with NanoString and RNA-seq showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes, but downregulation of the ROS pathway. Importantly, CD11b KO mice exhibited significantly improved locomotor function, reduced cutaneous mechanical/thermal hypersensitivity, and limited tissue damage at 8 weeks post-injury. Collectively, our data suggest an important role for CD11b in regulating tissue inflammation and functional outcome following SCI.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is characterized by a broad range of symptoms and disease trajectories. Understanding the correlation between clinical biomarkers and lung pathology during acute COVID-19 is necessary to understand its diverse pathogenesis and inform more effective treatments. Here, we present an integrated analysis of longitudinal clinical parameters, peripheral blood markers, and lung pathology in 142 Brazilian patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We identified core clinical and peripheral blood signatures differentiating disease progression between patients who recovered from severe disease compared with those who succumbed to the disease. Signatures were heterogeneous among fatal cases yet clustered into two patient groups: “early death” (<15 days until death) and “late death” (>15 days). Progression to early death was characterized systemically and in lung histopathological samples by rapid endothelial and myeloid activation and the presence of thrombi associated with SARS-CoV-2+ macrophages. In contrast, progression to late death was associated with fibrosis, apoptosis, and SARS-CoV-2+ epithelial cells in postmortem lung tissue. In late death cases, cytotoxicity, interferon, and T helper 17 (TH17) signatures were only detectable in the peripheral blood after 2 weeks of hospitalization. Progression to recovery was associated with higher lymphocyte counts, TH2 responses, and anti-inflammatory–mediated responses. By integrating antemortem longitudinal blood signatures and spatial single-cell lung signatures from postmortem lung samples, we defined clinical parameters that could be used to help predict COVID-19 outcomes. A single-cell lung atlas integrated with clinical and blood signatures can predict disease trajectories in COVID-19 progression. Editor’s summary A major challenge early during the COVID-19 pandemic was the inability to determine when a patient was going to recover or succumb to disease. Although vaccines, antivirals, and other therapeutics have limited the fatalities caused by COVID-19, the ability to predict disease progression remains important because it could help determine the best therapeutic approach for each patient. Here, Da Silva Filho et al. integrated antemortem peripheral blood analysis and clinical data with postmortem analysis of lung tissues to define signatures of recovery, early death, and late death from COVID-19. They then used these integrated signatures to identify peripheral blood and clinical parameters that could predict a patient’s trajectory. These data could be useful for anticipating a patient’s clinical course and for identifying personalized therapeutic approaches. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus caused the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the prevalence of deaths among men is higher than among women. The epididymis, divided into caput, corpus, and cauda, shows a region-specific immunity. The K18-hACE2 mouse expresses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor that allows SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, studies using this transgenic mouse to evaluate the impact of this viral infection in epididymis have not yet been performed.


OBJECTIVES
We evaluated the expression of hACE2 in the epididymis of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice, and assessed the epididymal immune response, focusing on F4/80+ mononuclear phagocytes and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The following analyses were performed in the epididymal sections of infected mice: epithelial height and duct diameter, birefringent collagen, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labelling, immunoreactions for detection of hACE2, spike, FGF, V-ATPase, F4/80, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and iNOS. Viral particles were identified under electron microscopy. hACE2, Rigi, Tgfb1 and Tnfa expression were also evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
All epididymal regions expressed hACE2, which increased in all epididymal regions in the infected mice. However, the caput appeared to be the most infected region. Despite this, the caput region showed minimal changes while the cauda showed significant epithelial changes associated with increased iNOS immunoexpression. The F4/80+ mononuclear phagocyte area increased significantly in both stroma and epithelium. In addition to the epithelial and stromal mononuclear phagocytes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha was also detected in clear cells, whose cytoplasm showed a significant increase of this cytokine in the infected animals.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The K18-hACE2 mouse is a useful model for evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the epididymis. The infection induced hACE2 upregulation, favoring the virulence in the epididymis. The epididymal regions responded differentially to infection, and the activation of F4/80+ mononuclear phagocytes associated with the increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha immunolabeling in clear cells indicates a role of clear cells/mononuclear phagocytes immunoregulatory mechanisms in the epididymal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurological disease of the central nervous system with a subclinical phase preceding frank neuroinflammation. CD8+ T cells are abundant within MS lesions, but their potential role in disease pathology remains unclear. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the cotwin had either no or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease. Proinflammatory features of CD8+ T cells in multiple sclerosis may serve as potential therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages. Editor’s summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the nervous system in which CD8 T cells are present in MS lesions, but their role in disease progression remains unclear. Kavaka et al. analyzed CD8 T cells from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of monozygotic twins, where one twin had MS and the other showed no signs or subclinical signs of neuroinflammation (SCNI). CD8 T cells from individuals with MS and cotwins with SCNI exhibited proinflammatory immunological and metabolic features consistent with enhanced activation and migration. These findings were validated in a separate cohort of individuals with MS, providing insights into the role of CD8 T cells in MS progression. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Obesity induces diverse changes in host immunity, resulting in worse disease outcomes following infection with various pathogens, including arthritogenic alphaviruses. However, the impact of obesity on the functional landscape of immune cells during arthritogenic alphavirus infection remains unexplored. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the blood and tissue immune responses to Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection in lean and obese mice. Footpad injection of MAYV caused significant shifts in immune cell populations and induced robust expression of interferon response and proinflammatory cytokine genes and related pathways in both blood and tissue. In MAYV-infected lean mice, analysis of the local tissue response revealed a unique macrophage subset with high expression of IFN response genes that was not found in obese mice. This was associated with less severe inflammation in lean mice. These results provide evidence for a unique macrophage population that may contribute to the superior capacity of lean mice to control arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Graphical abstract Highlights Obesity worsens disease outcomes following arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Arthritogenic alphavirus infection causes significant shifts in immune cell populations in the blood and footpad. Blood monocytes from lean mice had higher expression of interferon response genes at the later stage of infection. Footpads in lean mice have an expanded population of F4/80lo macrophages with an intense interferon response gene signature before and after alphavirus infection that is not found in obese mice. Macrophages in obese mice express lower levels of interferon response genes, have a unique necroptosis signature, and higher F4/80 expression.">

        <tr id="Background Viral respiratory infections are a significant global health burden. Human immune responses to infections caused by respiratory viruses are complex and dependent on the length of time the host has been infected. Human viral challenge studies provide a useful opportunity to understand the timing of human immune responses as samples can be obtained pre-inoculation and post-inoculation by defined virus inocula. Transcriptomic data is available from a large amount of publicly available viral challenge studies and genome-wide transcriptomic data is primarily derived from bulk samples containing mixed cell subpopulations. Traditional bulk transcriptomic analysis methods often utilize deconvolution techniques to study changes in cell proportions of major immune cell types. Methods and Principal Findings In this study, we digitally sorted the cellular diversity of 31 blood immune cell types over time in human challenge studies after inoculation by H3N2 influenza virus H1N1 influenza virus, and RSV using xCell, a digital cell separation method, on human bulk transcriptional repository data. We identified common inoculation-induced changes in cell subpopulations across studies of the three viruses with time kinetics. We observed a consistent elevation of myeloid cells and their subtypes post-inoculation across various viral inoculations. Lymphocytes and their subpopulations were reduced in symptomatic and infected (Sx/Inf) participants compared to asymptomatic and uninfected (Asx/Uninf) participants. H3N2 evoked the earliest transcriptional immune responses, followed by H1N1, RSV infection elicited a delayed transcriptional response compared to both influenza viruses likely due to slower replication kinetics. Our analysis also revealed unique immune cell composition changes caused by specific viruses. We found that pre-existing baseline memory T cells were associated with resistance to influenza viral infection and that the key cell type is effector memory (Tem) CD8 T cells. Conclusion These findings identify specific target cell subpopulations which respond to respiratory virus inoculation over time, shedding light on mechanisms for eliciting a robust baseline level of immune memory against multiple viral strains. These studies highlight potential immune cell responses that can be utilized to enhance vaccine design.">

        <tr id="Severe viral pneumonia can induce rapid expansion of KRT5+ basal-like cells in small airways and alveoli; this forms a scar-like structure that persists in the injured alveoli and impedes normal alveolar epithelium regeneration. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which viral infection induced this remodeling response. Through comparing different lung-injury models, we demonstrated that infection induced strong IFN-γ signal–stimulated dysplastic KRT5+ cell formation. Inactivation of interferon receptor 1 (Ifngr1) reduced dysplastic cell formation, ameliorated lung fibrosis, and improved lung-function recovery. Mechanistically, IFN-γ regulated dysplastic cell formation via the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) pathway. Inhibiting FAK/Src diminished IFN-γ–induced YAP nuclear translocation and dysplastic cell formation. Inhibiting YAP during viral infection prevented dysplastic cell formation, whereas inhibiting YAP in persistent KRT5+ cells led to their conversion into distal club cells. Importantly, human dysplastic cells exhibited elevated FAK and YAP activity, and IFN-γ treatment promoted the transformation of human alveolar progenitor cells into dysplastic cells. These findings uncover the role of infection-induced inflammatory response in alveolar remodeling and may provide potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of alveolar remodeling in patients with severe viral pneumonia.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism and mechanisms implicated in cardiac damage in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was completely restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible. Author Summary Mosquito-borne viruses, such as those within the alphavirus genus, are an ongoing concern to human health globally. While we have recently begun to explore the mechanisms of CHIKV-induced pathology in the heart, little is known about other arboviruses and alphaviruses related to CHIKV. Here, we identified that multiple cardiac cell types are susceptible to infection by several arboviruses important to public health. Specifically, we noted differences in how two related viruses, CHIKV and MAYV, infect endothelial cells from multiple origins. This work highlights the potential for other emerging arboviruses, in addition to CHIKV, to directly infect cardiac tissue. Moreover, it emphasizes the ability for MAYV, an emerging virus that is less studied, to infect various endothelial cell types to high titers, suggesting the need for further research on MAYV pathogenesis. Finally, this research identifies differences in infection between individual strains of CHIKV, suggesting a finely tuned mechanism of restriction in endothelial cells that can be further explored, as well as the need to study use different viral strains for future alphavirus research.">

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has been a global health concern since 2007. It primarily causes fetal microcephaly and neuronal defects through maternal transmission and induces neurological complications in adults. Recent studies report elevated proinflammatory cytokines and persistent neurological alterations post recovery, but the in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. In our study, viral RNA loads in the brains of mice infected with ZIKV peaked at 7 days post infection and returned to baseline by day 21, indicating recovery. RNA sequencing of the cerebral cortex at 7 and 21 days revealed upregulated genes related to neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Histological analyses indicated neuronal cell death and altered neurite morphology owing to severe neuroinflammation. Additionally, sustained microglial activation was associated with increased phospho-Tau levels, constituting a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings highlight how persistent microglial activation leads to neuronal dysfunction post ZIKV recovery, providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced brain abnormalities.">

        <tr id="Long COVID is a complex condition where symptoms persist for more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and affects an estimated 5-30% of individuals. While the pathobiology of long COVID is still evolving, persistent inflammation has emerged as an important feature of this condition. However, it is unclear if immune responses from COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 re-infection exacerbate or mirror the initial inflammatory responses. To address this question, we quantified 182 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins in plasma using multiplexed affinity proteomics. Plasma samples were collected 6-9 months after first infection, but before COVID-19 vaccination from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (n=21) or from individuals with long COVID (n=12). This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure.">

 Premature vascular aging and endothelial cell senescence are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and atherothrombotic disturbances, which are main complications of both acute and long COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which forms the crown of the coronavirus, can induce endothelial cells inflammation and has been found as an isolated element in both the circulation and human tissues reservoirs months after infection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether S protein is able to directly induce endothelial cell senescence and endothelial dysfunction and to decipher some of the mechanisms involved in such deleterious effect.



 Using primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cellular senescence was assessed by senescence-associated-β galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and the quantification of DNA damage response markers (γH2AX) and growth-arrest effectors (p53, p21, p16) by Western blot. Cytoprotective proteins were equally determined by Western blot. In isolated murine mesenteric microvessel, myography was used to assess defective vascular relaxation, as a key marker of endothelial dysfunction.



 In primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), SARS-CoV-2 S protein enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner from a threshold of 35 nmol/L the cellular content of senescence and DNA damage response markers, as well as growth-arrest effectors. In parallel, the S protein reduced the availability of cytoprotective proteins, such as the anti-aging protein klotho, Nrf2 or heme oxygenase-1, and caused functional harm by impairing ex vivo endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in murine microvessels. These effects were prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950. Furthermore, the supplementation with either recombinant klotho or angiotensin-(1-7), equally protected against the pro-senescence, pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant action of the S protein.



 Globally, this study proposes novel mechanisms of disease in the context of COVID-19 and its vascular sequelae and provides pharmacological clues in order to prevent such complications.

        <tr id="In the past decades, pneumonia has been plaguing countries around the world, with great implications for medical and public health. Systems pose a serious challenge. Many pneumonia outbreaks have occurred in local areas and even in the world. Since the end of 2019, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has once again attracted the world's attention to viral pneumonia. At present, a large number of basic research, drug development and clinical trials are being carried out for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. However, patients are generally given symptomatic and supportive treatment, antiviral therapy, immunotherapy, glucocorticoid therapy and respiratory support. Therefore, finding new and effective treatment methods based on the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still the current practical demand and research focus. This review focuses on the occurrence and development of CS and the immunopathological damage caused by CS in viral pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, and summarizes the potential means of treating CS through IL-related pathways. Research found that different viruses cause CS, cytokines involved in the type and severity of differences, therefore, should also be targeted in the treatment strategy. In addition, in addition to focusing on the treatment of CS, in order to better study the pathophysiological mechanism of virus-induced CS and screen intervention drugs efficiently, how to safely and effectively establish cell and animal models of CS and improve the scientific evaluation system are also key issues worthy of attention.">

        <tr id="Immune responses of the epithelia of the upper respiratory tract are likely crucial in early inhibition of the viral replication and finally clearance of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to compare the expression profiles of antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) and related cytokines observed in the nasopharynx of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and non-infected controls and to assess the associations between these parameters and COVID-19 patients’ outcomes. We included 45 subjects who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 22 control subjects who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Biomaterial for SARS-CoV-2 detection, as well as gene and protein expression studies, was obtained from all subjects using nasopharyngeal swabs which were performed a maximum of 7 days before inclusion in the study. Univariable and multivariable statistics were performed. When compared to the controls, the mRNA expression levels of human β-defensin 1 (hBD-1), LL-37, and trappin-2 were significantly higher in specimens of nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients. Protein expression of hBD-1 was also increased in the COVID-19 group. mRNA expression levels of interferon-ɣ (IFN-ɣ), tumor necrosis factor- ɑ (TNF-ɑ), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) measured in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were significantly higher than those observed in the controls, which could also be confirmed in the protein levels of IFN-ɣ and IL-6. A significant correlation between mRNA and protein levels could be observed only for IL-6. Univariable analysis revealed that low IFN-ɣ mRNA levels were associated with severe/fatal outcomes. The occurrence of COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly associated with lower expression levels of IL-6 mRNA, IFN-ɣ mRNA, and TNF-ɑ mRNA. Concerning the severe/fatal outcomes, the multivariable logistic regression model revealed that none of the aforementioned parameters remained significant in the model. However, the logistic regression model revealed that higher TNF-ɑ mRNA expression was a significant independent predictor of absence of pneumonia [odds ratio: 0.35 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.88, p = 0.024)]. In conclusion, nasopharyngeal expression of AMPs (hBD-1, LL-37, and trappin-2) and cytokines (IL-6, IFN-ɣ, and TNF-ɑ) is upregulated in response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that these AMPs and cytokines play a role in the local host defense against the virus. Upregulated nasopharyngeal TNF-ɑ mRNA expression during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection was a significant independent predictor of the absence of COVID-19 pneumonia. Hence, high TNF-ɑ mRNA expression in the nasopharynx appears to be a protective factor for lung complications in COVID-19 patients.">

 Introduction:
 COVID19-associated immunopathology is associated with increased production of interferon (IFN)-alpha (IFNα) and lambda3 (IFNL3). Effects of IFNs are mediated by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and influence expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for S-protein (S1P) of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that S1P-induced immune/inflammatory responses in endothelial cells (EC) are mediated via IFNs and may be important in vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension.


 Methods:
 Human microvascular ECs (MEC) were stimulated with S1P (1µg/mL), IFNα (100ng/mL) or IFNL3 (100IU/mL). Because ACE2, metalloproteinase domain-17 (ADAM17) and type-II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used inhibitors of ADAM17 (marimastat), ACE2 (MLN4760), and TMPRSS2 (camostat). Gene and protein expression was investigated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Vascular function was assessed in mesenteric arteries from wild-type (WT) normotensive and hypertensive mice and in ISG15KO mice.


 Results:
 MEC stimulated with S1P increased expression of IFNα (3-fold), IFNL3 (4-fold) and ISGs (2-fold) (p<0.05). IFNα and IFNλ3 increased protein expression of TMPRSS2 and ADAM17, but not ACE2. MEC exhibited higher responses to IFNα (ISG15: 16-fold) than to IFNL3 (ISG15: 1.7-fold) (p<0.05). ISG15 was also increased by S1P, effects that were enhanced by MLN4760 (2-fold) and reduced by marimastat (50%). S1P increased IL-6 mRNA (1.3-fold), TNFα (6.2-fold) and IL-1β (3.3-fold). These responses were increased by by IFNs. IL-6 was increased by IFNα (1,230pg/mL) and IFNL3 (1,124pg/mL) vs control (591pg/mL). This was associated with increased phosphorylation of Stat1 (134%), Stat2 (102%), ERK1/2 (42%). Nitric oxide production and eNOS phosphorylation (Ser1177) were reduced by IFNα and (40%) and IFNL3 (40%). Reduced endothelium-relaxation maximal response (%Emax) was observed in vessels from WT-mice stimulated with IFNα (67%) and IFNL3 (71%) vs control (82%) (p<0.05) but not in vessels from ISG15KO mice. Increased contraction was observed only in vessels from hypertensive mice treated with IFNα (9.1±0.5mN vs control: 7.3±0.3mN, p<0.05).


 Conclusions:
 In ECs, S1P, IFNα and IFNL3 increased ISG15 and IL-6, processes that involve ADAM17 and are independent on ACE2. Inflammation induced by S1P was amplified by IFNs. IFNs induce vascular dysfunction through ISG15-dependent mechanisms, with augmented effects in hypertension.

        <tr id="Introduction Approximately 20-40% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experience neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), which often manifests as cognitive dysfunction and depression. Currently, there are no approved treatments for NPSLE because its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Identifying relevant mediators and understanding their contribution to pathogenesis are crucial for developing targeted treatment options. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is a multifunctional acute-phase protein that plays important roles in immune cell differentiation, migration, and function. LCN2 has been implicated in models of neuroinflammatory disease. Methods We generated an LCN2-deficient MRL/lpr mouse to evaluate the effects of LCN2 on this classic NPSLE model. To evaluate the effects of LCN2 deficiency on behavior, the mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests evaluating depression, memory, and anxiety. Flow cytometry was used to quantify immune cell populations in the brain, blood, and secondary lymphoid organs. Cutaneous disease was quantified by scoring lesional skin, and skin infiltrates were quantified through immunofluorescent staining. Systemic disease was evaluated through measuring anti-nuclear antibodies by ELISA. Results In this study, we found that LCN2 deficiency significantly attenuates neuropsychiatric and cutaneous disease in MRL/lpr lupus prone mice, likely by decreasing local infiltration of immune cells into the brain and skin and reducing astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. Anti-nuclear antibodies and kidney disease were not affected by LCN2. Discussion As there was no effect on systemic disease, our results suggest that the inflammatory effects of LCN2 were localized to the skin and brain in this model. This study further establishes LCN2 as a potential target to ameliorate organ injury in SLE, including neuropsychiatric and cutaneous disease.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals’ daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes CLEC4A, FDFT1, CTNNB1, GPI, PMM2, PTPRD, IL7, ALDH3B1, AASS, AOC3, SEPINE1, PFKFB1, FTCD, TIMP1 and GATM were finally selected. In order to validate the model’s accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="The identification of specific markers for microglia has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, markers such as P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls have been proposed as microglia-specific and widely used to explore microglial functions within various central nervous system (CNS) contexts. The specificity of these markers was based on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures even after infiltrating the CNS. However, recent findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes can adopt microglia-like characteristics while maintaining a pro-inflammatory profile upon permanent engraftment in the CNS.In this study, we utilize bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that engrafted monocytes acquire expression of established microglia markers—P2ry12, TMEM119, Fcrls—and the pan-myeloid marker Iba1, which has been commonly mischaracterized as microglia-specific. These changes are accompanied by alterations in chromatin accessibility and shifts in chromatin binding motifs that are indicative of microglial identity. Moreover, we show that engrafted monocytes dynamically regulate the expression of CX3CR1, CCR2, Ly6C, and transcription factors PU.1, CTCF, RUNX, AP-1, CEBP, and IRF2, all of which are crucial for shaping microglial identity. This study is the first to illustrate that engrafted monocytes in the retina undergo both epigenetic and transcriptional changes, enabling them to express microglia-like signatures. These findings highlight the need for future research to account for these changes when assessing the roles of monocytes and microglia in CNS pathology. Significance Statement Monocytes can express putative microglia markers P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls upon engraftment into the retina. Given their involvement in neuroinflammation, it is crucial to consider this overlap when utilizing these markers for experimental analysis.">

        <tr id="With circulation of SARS-CoV-2, fears about coinfection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV were significant, but the opposite was observed. Distancing/barriers played a major role in reducing other viral co-infections, however, some infrequent co-infections still occurred. We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV during coinfection to understand how they might compete or synergize. We found only RSV’s replication was significantly reduced when coinfected with SARS-CoV-2. Investigation of the mechanism revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp1 disrupts the RSV M2-2 protein but not the upstream M2-1 protein on the same biscistronic mRNA transcript. The impact of Nsp1 on M2-2 was not dependent on M2-2 being the second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA transcript, but likely from prevention of ribosomal termination-reinitiation necessary for M2-2 production. Additional viral ORFs from influenza A, influenza B, or Sendai virus dependent on the same or other ribosomal initiation mechanisms were tested and we found only influenza B M/M2 which likely uses a similar method as M2-2 was disrupted. Various M2-2 constructs, with/without the proposed site of ribosomal termination-reinitiating, co-transfected with Nsp1 and were in agreement that disruption to M2-2 expression occurs if the site of re-initiation was present upstream. These data not only suggest Sars-CoV-2 can outcompete RSV through suppression of M2, but may also point to potential ways to interfere with RSV by targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, particularly causes severe inflammatory disease in elderly, obese, and male patients. Since both aging and obesity are associated with decreased testosterone and estradiol expression, we hypothesized that decreased hormone levels contribute to excessive inflammation in the context of COVID-19. Previously, we and others have shown that hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 patients is induced by the production of pathogenic anti-spike IgG antibodies that activate alveolar macrophages. Therefore, we developed an in vitro assay in which we stimulated human macrophages with viral stimuli, anti-spike IgG immune complexes, and different sex hormones. Treatment with levels of testosterone reflecting young adults led to a significant reduction in TNF and IFN-γ production by human macrophages. In addition, estradiol significantly attenuated the production of a very broad panel of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ. Both testosterone and estradiol reduced the expression of Fc gamma receptors IIa and III, the two main receptors responsible for anti-spike IgG-induced inflammation. Combined, these findings indicate that sex hormones reduce the inflammatory response of human alveolar macrophages to specific COVID-19-associated stimuli, thereby providing a potential immunological mechanism for the development of severe COVID-19 in both older male and female patients.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: The study aims to explore the potential for transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on its pathophysiology, placental defense mechanisms, and the clinical implications for maternal and neonatal health. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive review of the current literature was conducted, analyzing studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, the expression of key viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in placental cells, and the immune responses involved in placental defense. The review also examined the clinical outcomes related to maternal and neonatal health, including adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta supports the biological plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 transplacental transmission. Histopathological findings from the infected placentas reveal inflammation, vascular changes, and the evidence of viral particles in placental tissues. Clinical reports indicate an increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and neonatal infection in pregnancies affected by COVID-19. However, the frequency and mechanisms of vertical transmission remain variable across studies, highlighting the need for standardized research protocols. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can potentially infect placental cells, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. While evidence of transplacental transmission has been documented, the risk and mechanisms are not fully understood. Ongoing research is essential to clarify these aspects and inform obstetric care practices to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective COVID-19 induces the development of autoimmune diseases, including SLE, which are characterised by inflammation, autoantibodies and thrombosis. However, the effects of COVID-19 on SLE remain unclear. Methods We investigated the effects of COVID-19 on SLE development and progression in three animal models. Plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 receptor were injected into R848-induced BALB/C lupus mice, R848-induced IL-1 receptor antagonist knockout (KO) lupus mice and MRL/lpr mice. Serum levels of albumin and autoantibodies, lymphocyte phenotypes and tissue histology were evaluated. Results In R848-induced BALB/C lupus mice, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increased autoantibody and albumin levels compared with vehicle and mock treatments. These mice also exhibited splenomegaly, which was further exacerbated by the spike protein. Flow cytometric analysis revealed elevated T helper 1 cell counts, and histological analysis indicated increased levels of the fibrosis marker protein α-smooth muscle actin. In KO mice, the spike protein induced splenomegaly, severe kidney damage and pronounced lung fibrosis. In the MRL/lpr group, spike protein increased the serum levels of autoantibodies, albumin and the thrombosis marker chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 4. Conclusion COVID-19 accelerated the development and progression of lupus by inducing autoantibody production, fibrosis and thrombosis.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced vascular damage causes ischemia and hypoxia at the injury site, which, in turn, leads to profound metabolic disruptions. The effects of these metabolic alterations on neural tissue remodeling and functional recovery have yet to be elucidated. The current study aimed to investigate the consequences of the SCI-induced hypoxic environment at the epicenter of the injury. Methods: This study employed metabolomics to assess changes in energy metabolism after SCI. The use of a lactate sensor identified lactate shuttle between endothelial cells (ECs) and neurons. Reanalysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated reduced MCT1 expression in ECs after SCI. Additionally, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) overexpressing MCT1 was utilized to elucidate its role in endothelial-neuronal interactions, tissue repair, and functional recovery. Results: The findings revealed markedly decreased monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expression that facilitates lactate delivery to neurons to support their energy metabolism in ECs post-SCI. This decreased expression of MCT1 disrupts lactate transport to neurons, resulting in a metabolic imbalance that impedes axonal regeneration. Strikingly, our results suggested that administering adeno-associated virus specifically to ECs to restore MCT1 expression enhances axonal regeneration and improves functional recovery in SCI mice. These findings indicate a novel link between lactate shuttling from endothelial cells to neurons following SCI and subsequent neural functional recovery. Conclusion: In summary, the current study highlights a novel metabolic pathway for therapeutic interventions in the treatment of SCI. Additionally, our findings indicate the potential benefits of targeting lactate transport mechanisms in recovery from SCI.">

Mtb infected and multiplied in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. The permeability of the BBB increased resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects included increased markers of cellular stress, ROS release, the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes, and increased secretion of neuroexcitotoxic glutamate. Distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators were observed. These data indicate Mtb can translocate the BBB directly to initiate meningitis.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the brain’s immune cells, are highly responsive to their local environment. Given that circulatory proteins can enter the brain, we asked whether microglia are responsive to such proteins. Here, we identify a stable population of microglia specialized to take up circulatory proteins in a region-specific manner under physiological conditions; human hematopoietic stem cell-derived microglia replacing endogenous microglia in chimeric mice show similar regional specialization. Plasma-positive microglia are characterized by prominent expression of genes related to innate immunity and antigen presentation and exhibit high metabolic and phagocytic activity. This activity is dependent, in part, on microglial uptake and accumulation of circulatory Apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I). Our findings thus identify a new model of communication between brain and periphery through specialized microglia.">

        <tr id="Background: Studies have reported that 5hmC features in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could serve as early warning biomarkers for the occurrence and progression of COVID-19, as well as myocardial injury. However, its roles in the occurrence and progression of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) following COVID-19 infection has not been fully studied. Methods: Firstly, we used the 5hmC-Seal technique to obtain genome-wide 5hmC profiles from plasma cfDNA of 24 ACS2N patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset within 2 months after COVID-19 infection), 28 ACS2W patients (individuals experiencing ACS onset beyond 2 months after COVID-19 infection), and 16 ACS patients (patients with ACS without COVID-19 infection). Secondly, we performed GO, KEGG analysis on the differentially expressed genes and identified a series of immune and inflammation related genes. Thirdly, the distribution of immune cells in different groups of patients was studied by immune infiltration analysis. Finally, we performed PPI network analysis on these genes to identify potential key target genes. Results: In this study, we firstly found that there was a significant difference in 5hmC levels between ACS2N patients and ACS patients, while the difference between ACS2W and ACS was not significant. Secondly, it was found that neutrophils were abnormally activated in the ACS2N group. Finally, a target gene phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) was found to be highly expressed in the ACS2N group by PPI network analysis of the differential genes and validated with external datasets. Conclusions: Our study suggested that 5hmC markers extracted from plasma cfDNA could differentiate between ACS2N and ACS patients. In addition, we observed that neutrophils exhibited abnormal activation in ACS2N patients. Further analysis showed that COVID-19 infection may affect the occurrence and development of ACS by abnormally up-regulating PDE4D gene expression.">

Particularly in the lung, GM-CSF plays an important homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of alveolar macrophages, and is therefore considered to play a role in respiratory virus infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, although the benefits of GM-CSF treatment in clinical studies remain inconclusive. To address this, we tested inhaled GM-CSF treatment in the Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) mouse model. Our findings show that local GM-CSF therapy during PVM disease increased local neutrophilia and monocyte-derived cell influx, but diminished CD8+ T cells responses. Despite this, the observed effects on T cells and myeloid cells did not result in an altered clinical outcome during PVM infection. We conclude that inhaled GM-CSF therapy cannot be considered as a universal protective therapy in respiratory virus infections.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence points to the microbial exposome as a critical factor in maturing and shaping the host immune system, thereby influencing responses to immune challenges such as infections or vaccines. To investigate the effect of early-life viral exposures on immune development and vaccine responses, we inoculated mice with six distinct viral pathogens in sequence beginning in the neonatal period, and then evaluated their immune signatures before and after intramuscular or intranasal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Sequential viral infection drove profound changes in all aspects of the immune system, including increasing circulating leukocytes, altering innate and adaptive immune cell lineages in tissues, and markedly influencing serum cytokine and total antibody levels. Beyond changes in the immune responses, these exposures also modulated the composition of the endogenous intestinal microbiota. Although sequentially-infected mice exhibited increased systemic immune activation and T cell responses after intramuscular and intranasal SARS-CoV-2 immunization, we observed decreased vaccine-induced antibody responses in these animals. These results suggest that early-life viral exposures are sufficient to diminish antibody responses to vaccination in mice, and highlight the potential importance of considering prior microbial exposures when investigating vaccine responses.">

        <tr id="Background Limited data are available describing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections on the plasma proteome. Methods PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients, enrolled in a natural history study, underwent analysis of the plasma proteome. A prospective cohort of 66 unvaccinated and 24 vaccinated persons with different degrees of infection severity were evaluated acutely (within 40 days of symptom onset), and at three and ten months. Comparisons based on vaccination status alone and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were performed. A second cohort of vaccinated Omicron patients were evaluated acutely and at ten months. Results Acutely, unvaccinated patients manifested overexpression of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while vaccinated patients exhibited adaptive immune responses without significant inflammation. At three and ten months, only unvaccinated patients had diminished but sustained inflammatory (C3b, CCL15, IL17RE) and immune responses (DEFA5,TREM1). Both groups had underexpression of pathways essential for cellular function, signaling, and angiogenesis (AKT1, MAPK14, HSPB1) across phases. Unsupervised clustering, based on protein expression, identified four groups of patients with variable vaccination rates demonstrating that additional clinical factors influence the plasma proteome. The proteome of vaccinated Omicron patients did not differ from vaccinated pre-Omicron patients. Conclusions Vaccination attenuates the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection across phases. However, at ten months after symptom onset, changes in the plasma proteome persist in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, which may be relevant to post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections associated with post-acute infection syndromes.">

        <tr id="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm birth. Supplemental oxygen administration, while lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to develop BPD. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that the innate immune response activated in the lungs of mice sensitive to hyperoxia that develop BPD-like lung injury differs from mice resilient to disease. Specifically, we identified a selective upregulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on lung macrophages and monocytes in the hyperoxia-sensitive C57BL/6J mouse strain. We show that loss of function of TREM2 signaling in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatically improved phenotype after neonatal hyperoxia exposure characterized by a dampened immune response, preserved alveolar structure, and preserved cell proliferative potential supporting normal lung development. At the molecular level, inhibition of TREM2 signaling dampened the magnitude of p53 activation and resulted in cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. These findings show that TREM2 is a critical regulator of the pathogenic innate immune response to hyperoxia and highlight its importance as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating injury in the hyperoxia-exposed developing lung.">

In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner.

Acute infectious diseases are some of the most common reasons for receiving medical care, and analysis of the host immune response is an attractive approach for their diagnosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential usefulness of CD169 expression on peripheral monocytes (mCD169) as a marker of viral-associated host immune response.


METHODS
In a large mono-institutional cohort of 4,025 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) and other viral infections, mCD169 analysis was performed by rapid flow cytometry assay.


RESULTS
Increased mCD169 values (median, 17.50; IQR, 8.40-25.72) were found in 1,631 patients with CoV2+ acute infection compared to 2,394 in CoV2- patients (median, 2.35; IQR, 2.0-3.25) (odds ratio [OR], 21.84; 95% CI ,17.53-27.21; P < .001). Among CoV2- patients, 1,484 (62.0%) were assessed for other viral infections, and viral etiology was laboratory confirmed in 428 patients (CoV2- Vir+), with RNA viruses most frequently detected (94.6%). Higher levels of mCD169 were also confirmed in CoV2- Vir+ compared to CoV2- Vir- patients (OR, 10.05; 95% CI, 7.35-13.74; P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
mCD169 analysis by rapid flow cytometry assay may be a sensitive broad marker useful for the rapid triage of patients with suspected acute viral infections and could potentially be directly applied to eventual new emergent viral outbreaks.">

        <tr id="The nasal, oropharyngeal, and bronchial mucosa are primary contact points for airborne pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), SARS-CoV-2, and influenza virus. While mucosal surfaces can function as both entry points and barriers to infection, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) facilitate early immune responses to mucosal antigens. MALT contains a variety of specialized epithelial cells, including a rare cell type called a microfold cell (M cell) that functions to transport apical antigens to basolateral antigen-presenting cells, a crucial step in the initiation of mucosal immunity. M cells have been extensively characterized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in murine and human models. However, the precise development and functions of human airway M cells is unknown. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we generated an atlas of cells from the human adenoid and identified 16 unique cell types representing basal, club, hillock, and hematopoietic lineages, defined their developmental trajectories, and determined cell-cell relationships. Using trajectory analysis, we found that human airway M cells develop from progenitor club cells and express a gene signature distinct from intestinal M cells. Surprisingly, we also identified a heretofore unknown epithelial cell type demonstrating a robust interferon-stimulated gene signature. Our analysis of human adenoid cells enhances our understanding of mucosal immune responses and the role of M cells in airway immunity. This work also provides a resource for understanding early interactions of pathogens with airway mucosa and a platform for development of mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="Background In Parkinson's disease (PD) brains, microglia are activated to release inflammatory factors to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuron, and vice versa. Moreover, neuroinflammation and its synergistic interaction with oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Methods In this study, we investigated whether in-house synthetic coumarin-chalcone derivatives protect human microglia HMC3 and neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 cells against 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP+)-induced neuroinflammation and associated neuronal damage. Results Treatment with MPP+ decreased cell viability as well as increased the release of inflammatory mediators including cytokines and nitric oxide in culture medium, and enhanced expression of microglial activation markers CD68 and MHCII in HMC3 cells. The protein levels of NLRP3, CASP1, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were also increased in MPP+-stimulated HMC3 cells. Among the four tested compounds, LM-016, LM-021, and LM-036 at 10 μM counteracted the inflammatory action of MPP+ in HMC3 cells. In addition, LM-021 and LM-036 increased cell viability, reduced lactate dehydrogenase release, ameliorated cellular ROS production, decreased caspase-1, caspase-3 and caspase-6 activities, and promoted neurite outgrowth in MPP+-treated BE(2)-M17 cells. These protective effects were mediated by down-regulating inflammatory NLRP1, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, as well as up-regulating antioxidative NRF2, NQO1, GCLC, and PGC-1α, and neuroprotective CREB, BDNF, and BCL2. Conclusion The study results strengthen the involvement of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in PD pathogenic mechanisms, and indicate the potential use of LM-021 and LM-036 as dual inflammasome inhibitors in treating both NLRP1- and NLRP3-associated PD.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory demyelination occurring in the central nervous system (CNS). Inulin is a common prebiotic that can improve metabolic disorders by modulating the gut microbiota. However, its capacity to affect CNS autoimmunity is poorly recognized. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a classical mouse model of MS. Herein, we found that oral administration of inulin ameliorated the severity EAE in mice, accompanied by reductions in inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination in the CNS. These reductions were associated with decreased proportion and numbers of Th17 cells in brain and spleen. Consistent with the findings, the serum concentrations of IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-α were reduced in inulin treated EAE mice. Moreover, the proliferation of auto-reactive lymphocytes, against MOG35-55 antigen, was attenuated ex vivo. Mechanistically, inulin treatment altered the composition of gut microbiota. It increased Lactobacillus and Dubosiella whereas decreased g_Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group at the genus level, alongside with elevated concentration of butyric acid in fecal content and serum. In vitro, butyrate, but not inulin, could inhibit the activation of MOG35-55 stimulated lymphocytes. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation assay confirmed that fecal contents of inulin-treated normal mice had an ameliorative effect on EAE mice. In contrast, antibiotic cocktail (ABX) treatment diminished the therapeutic effect of inulin in EAE mice as well as the reduction of Th17 cells, while supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri restored the amelioration effect. These results confirmed that the attenuation of inulin on Th17 cells and inflammatory demyelination in EAE mice was dependent on its modulation on gut microbiota and metabolites. Our findings provide a potential therapeutic regimen for prebiotic inulin supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="Age-related susceptibility to sepsis and endotoxemia is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system and the expansion of the visceral adipose as an immunological reservoir are underlying features. Macrophages from older organisms exhibit substantial changes, including chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, genomic remodeling and a dysfunctional, amplified inflammatory response upon new exposure to pathogen. However, the mechanisms by which old macrophages maintain their inflammatory phenotype during endotoxemia remains elusive. We previously identified Gdf3, a TGFβ superfamily cytokine, as a top-regulated gene by age and the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we demonstrate that endotoxemia increases inflammatory (CD11c+) ATMs in a Gdf3- dependent manner in old mice. Lifelong systemic or myeloid-specific deletion of Gdf3 leads to reduced endotoxemia- induced inflammation, with decreased CD11c+ ATMs and inflammatory cytokines, and protection from hypothermia. Moreover, acute blockade of Gdf3 using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, phenocopies old mice with lifelong Gdf3-deficiency. We show that GDF3 promotes the inflammatory phenotype in ATMs by phosphorylating SMAD2/3. Mechanistically, the differential chromatin landscape of ATMs from old mice with or without myeloid-driven Gdf3 indicates that GDF3- SMAD2/3 signaling axis shifts the chromatin accessibility of ATMs towards an inflammatory state during aging. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of SMAD3 with a specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3) mimics Gdf3 deletion. SIS3 reduces endotoxemia-mediated inflammation with fewer CD11c+ ATMs and less severe hypothermia in old, but not young mice, as well as reduced mortality. In human adipose tissue, age positively correlates with GDF3 level, while inflammation correlates with pSMAD2/3 level. Overall, these results highlight the importance of GDF3-SMAD2/3 axis in driving inflammation in older organisms and identify this signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating endotoxemia-related inflammation in the aged.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated severity have been linked to uncontrolled inflammation and may be associated with changes in the microbiome of mucosal sites including the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. These sites play an important role in host-microbe homeostasis, and disruption of epithelial barrier integrity during COVID-19 may potentially lead to exacerbated inflammation and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in COVID-19 are highly disparate, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal, and the impact of microbial dysbiosis on disease severity is unclear. Here, we obtained plasma, rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasal swabs from 86 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 12 healthy volunteers. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial communities in the mucosal swabs and measured concentrations of circulating cytokines, markers of gut barrier integrity, and fatty acids in the plasma samples. We compared these plasma concentrations and microbiomes between healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients, some of whom had unfortunately died by the end of the study enrollment, and performed a correlation analysis between plasma variables and bacterial abundances. Rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients had reduced abundances of several commensal bacteria including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increased abundance of the opportunistic pathogens Eggerthella lenta and Hungatella hathewayi. Furthermore, the oral pathogen Scardovia wiggsiae was more abundant in the oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients who died. The abundance of both H. hathewayi and S. wiggsiae correlated with circulating inflammatory markers including IL-6, highlighting the possible role of the microbiome in COVID-19 severity and providing potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19.IMPORTANCEOutcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly disparate and are associated with uncontrolled inflammation; however, the individual factors that lead to this uncontrolled inflammation are not fully understood. Here, we report that severe COVID-19 is associated with systemic inflammation, microbial translocation, and microbial dysbiosis. The rectal and oropharyngeal microbiomes of COVID-19 patients were characterized by a decreased abundance of commensal bacteria and an increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens, which positively correlated with markers of inflammation and microbial translocation. These microbial perturbations may, therefore, contribute to disease severity in COVID-19 and highlight the potential for microbiome-based interventions in improving COVID-19 outcomes.">

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often causes coagulation disorders that affect highly vascularized organs, such as the lungs and kidneys.

Objective
The objective of this study was to report the histopathological findings of variations in the fibrin pattern of pulmonary and renal microthrombi in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Minimally invasive autopsies were performed on 40 patients to collect lung (n=40) and kidney (n=16) tissue samples. Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques were used for histopathological analyses. Premortem laboratory data were obtained from the patients' electronic medical records.

Results
The lung tissue showed a patchy pattern, characterized by areas of both minimal and severe damage. The most significant histopathological finding was the detection of thrombi with fibrin structures organized into discrete star-shaped units, which were more frequently observed in areas with severe lung injury than in those with minimal lung injury (p = 0.012). Star-shaped fibrin structures were also observed in the renal glomerular capillaries. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of platelets and the procoagulant proteins von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Factor VIII within the star-shaped fibrin thrombi. Patients with star-shaped fibrin thrombi had higher levels of the systemic inflammatory indicators C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

Conclusion
Our observations suggest that the inflammatory microenvironment resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the formation of star-shaped fibrin units in the pulmonary and renal microthrombi.">

        <tr id="Astroviruses are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and have been recognized to cause fatal cases of encephalitis. A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model, as previous attempts failed to identify a suitable host that supports viral replication.

VA1 RNA levels peak in heart tissue at day 7 post-inoculation. The cardiotropism was observed in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds evidenced by high VA1 RNA loads in heart tissue of A/J, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, Balb/c, and J:ARC mice. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Intracellular viral capsid was present in tissue sections based on immunofluorescent staining and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA co-localizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by > 10-fold in heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we also tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in human cardiac microvascular and coronary artery endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of viral pathogenesis and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses. Author Summary Astroviruses typically cause viral diarrhea in humans but can also cause serious infections of the brain. Previously, the methods available to study how these viruses lead to invasive infections were limited. Here, we describe the first system to study human-infecting astroviruses using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infected heart tissue and was associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of virus in their hearts and blood. Linking back to human health, we also found that VA1 can infect cells derived from human blood vessels of the heart. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans. In the future, we can develop interventions that will prevent and treat astrovirus infections in humans.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Neurocognitive impairment is a prevalent and important co-morbidity in virologically suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH), yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and treatments lacking. Here, we explored for the first time, use of participant-derived directly induced neurons (iNs) to model neuronal biology and injury in PLWH. iNs retain age-and disease-related features of the donors, providing unique opportunities to reveal novel aspects of neurological disorders. We obtained primary dermal fibroblasts from six virologically suppressed PLWH (range: 27 – 64 years, median: 53); 83% Male; 50% White) and seven matched people without HIV (PWOH) (range: 27 – 66, median: 55); 71% Male; 57% White). iNs were generated using transcription factors NGN2 and ASCL1, and validated by immunocytochemistry and single-cell-RNAseq. Transcriptomic analysis using bulk-RNAseq identified 29 significantly differentially expressed genes between iNs from PLWH and PWOH. Of these, 16 genes were downregulated and 13 upregulated in PLWH iNs. Protein-protein interaction network mapping indicates that iNs from PLWH exhibit differences in extracellular matrix organization and synaptic transmission. IFI27 was upregulated in iNs from PLWH, which complements independent post-mortem studies demonstrating elevated IFI27 expression in PLWH-derived brain tissue, indicating that iN generation reconstitutes this pathway. Finally, we observed that expression of the FOXL2NB-FOXL2-LINC01391 genome locus is reduced in iNs from PLWH and negatively correlates with neurocognitive impairment. Thus, we have identified an iN gene signature of HIV through direct reprogramming of skin fibroblasts into neurons revealing novel mechanisms of neurocognitive impairment in PLWH.

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19). Several mechanisms contribute to the reduction in serotonin levels, such as the impaired absorption of dietary tryptophan, hindered serotonin transport via platelets, and increased activity of an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin. Individuals seeking treatment for long COVID-19 had lower serotonin levels in their blood than those who had fully recovered from the infection. Furthermore, patients with long COVID-19 also had reduced tryptophan levels. The potential benefits of dietary supplementation with tryptophan or the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to improve cognitive impairments and depressive and anxiety disorders in long-term COVID-19 patients. The findings support the immune response’s pivotal role in modulating serotonin levels and further highlight the intricate connection between the immune system and neurotransmitter regulation.">

        <tr id="Lung tumor-promoting environmental exposures and γherpesvirus infections are associated with Type 17 inflammation. To test the effect of γherpesvirus infection in promoting lung tumorigenesis, we infected mutant K-Ras-expressing (K-RasLA1) mice with the murine γherpesvirus MHV68 via oropharyngeal aspiration. After 7 weeks, the infected mice displayed a more than 2-fold increase in lung tumors relative to their K-RasLA1 uninfected littermates. Assessment of cytokines in the lung revealed that expression of Type 17 cytokines (Il-6, Cxcl1, Csf3) peaked at day 7 post-infection. These observations correlated with the post-infection appearance of known immune mediators of tumor promotion via IL-17A in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, Cd84, an immune cell marker mRNA, did not increase in MHV68-infected wild-type mice lacking lung tumors. Csf3 and Cxcl1 protein levels increased more in the lungs of infected K-RasLA1 mice relative to infected wild-type littermates. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the infected K-RasLA1 mice had increased Ly6Gdim/Ly6Chi immune cells in the lung relative to levels seen in uninfected control K-RasLA1 mice. Selective methylation of adenosines (m6A modification) in immune-cell-enriched mRNAs appeared to correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. These observations implicate γherpesvirus infection in lung tumor promotion and selective accumulation of immune cells in the lung that appears to be associated with m6A modification of mRNAs in those cells.">

        <tr id="IL-23 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the cellular targets and signaling pathways affected by this cytokine remain poorly understood. We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome in COVID-19, leads to complex immune reactions, hyperactivation of immunocompetent cells, including increased degranulation activity of mast cells and the release of their secretome products. The SARS-CoV-2 virus and the subsequent strong immune and inflammatory response, as well as a violation of the regulation of coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways, cause massive activation of latent TGF-β in the lungs, as well as the latent pool of TGF-β in the blood of patients with COVID-19. 
AIMS: To assume the participation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in lung damage in patients with COVID-19 by determining its quantitative level in autopsy lung samples in patients with COVID-19 and to conduct a correlation analysis with clinical and laboratory parameters. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included samples of lung autopsy material obtained from patients who died from severe COVID-19. A correlation analysis of TGF-β-positive cells and clinical and laboratory parameters was also performed. 
RESULTS: Extensive representation of TGF-β-positive cells was found in lung tissues of patients who died from COVID-19.A negative correlation was revealed: between TGF-β and the content of nucleated neutrophils in the blood (r = - 0,617; p = 0,033); between TGF-β and the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) according to the results of blood biochemistry (r = - 0,491; p = 0,013). A positive correlation was revealed between TGF-β and the content of blood platelets (r = 0,384; p =0,012);TGF-β with the level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = 0,409; p = 0,025). A positive correlation was also found between TGF-β and the presence of cough in the patient at the beginning of hospitalization (r = 0,367; p = 0,046). 
CONCLUSIONS: Activation of TGF-β in the lungs of patients who died from severe COVID-19 correlates with the level of neutrophils, platelets, ESR, CRP and the presence of cough in the patient. Further research is needed on the activation, release of TGF-β and its interactions in larger cohorts of patients. These correlations suggest the negative involvement of the transforming growth factor and consider the therapeutic possibilities of regulatory influence on its activation.">

        <tr id="Background: The difference in the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with mild versus severe disease remains poorly understood. Recent scientific advances have recognised the vital role of both B cells and T cells; however, many questions remain unanswered, particularly for T cell responses. T cells are essential for helping the generation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses but have also been recognised in their own right as a major factor influencing COVID-19 disease outcomes. The examination of T cell receptor (TCR) family differences over a 12-month period in patients with varying COVID-19 disease severity is crucial for understanding T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We applied a machine learning approach to analyse TCR vb family responses in COVID-19 patients (n = 151) across multiple timepoints and disease severities alongside SARS-CoV-2 infection-naïve (healthy control) individ-uals (n = 62). Results: Blood samples from hospital in-patients with moderate, severe, or critical disease could be classified with an accuracy of 94%. Furthermore, we identified significant variances in TCR vb family specificities between disease and control subgroups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest advantageous and disadvantageous TCR repertoire patterns in relation to disease severity. Following validation in larger cohorts, our methodology may be useful in detecting protective immunity and the assessment of long-term outcomes, particularly as we begin to unravel the immunological mechanisms leading to post-COVID complications.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are the leading cause of disease exacerbations in individuals with chronic pulmonary diseases, primarily due to impaired macrophage functions, resulting in defective bacterial elimination. We previously demonstrated that HRV16 impairs macrophages’ functions in an ARL5b-dependent manner. In permissive cells, ARL5b acted as an HRV16 restriction factor and was repressed. Here, we delve into the dual regulation of ARL5b by HRV16 in both cell types. We analyzed the effect of HRV16 on primary human macrophages using neutralizing antibodies, specific inhibitors, siRNA, and chromatin immune precipitation. Our study reveals that, while the virus does not replicate in macrophages, it induces interferon and pro-inflammatory responses. We identify the ICAM-1-PKR-ATF2 signaling axis as crucial for ARL5b induction in macrophages, whereas only ICAM-1 plays a role in ARL5b repression in permissive cells. Furthermore, HRV16 triggers epigenetic reprogramming in both cell types at the ARL5b promoter. In macrophages, epigenetic changes are ATF2 dependent. In conclusion, our findings highlight previously unknown signaling pathways activated by HRV16 in macrophages. Targeting these pathways could offer novel strategies to improve outcomes for individuals with respiratory conditions. IMPORTANCE Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are the leading cause of disease exacerbations in individuals with chronic pulmonary conditions and are frequently associated with bacterial superinfections due to defective bacterial elimination by macrophages. We previously identified ARL5b-induction by HRV16 to be responsible for the impairment of bacteria elimination. In contrast, in permissive cells, ARL5b is repressed and acts as a restriction factor for HRV16. Here, we investigated the dual regulation of ARL5b by HRV16 in these cells. Our study reveals that the ICAM-1-PKR-ATF2 signaling axis is crucial for ARL5b induction in macrophages. In permissive cells, only ICAM-1 plays a role in ARL5b repression. Moreover, HRV16 triggered epigenetic reprogramming in macrophages. ARL5b promoter was repressed in an ATF2-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings reveal previously unknown signaling pathways activated by HRV16 in macrophages. Targeting these pathways provides novel strategies to target ARL5b expression specifically in macrophages and improve outcomes for individuals with respiratory pathologies.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident immune cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS), play crucial roles in homeostasis, immune responses, and the modulation of neuronal functions. In brain tumors, microglia are difficult to distinguish from infiltrating macrophages and are collectively called Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs). While these cells exhibit plasticity, support tumor growth, and suppress antitumor immune responses, their identity and function remain largely unknown. Cellular senescence, a state of growth arrest associated with the upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A (Cdkn2a), can both suppress and promote tumor progression via the secretion of inflammatory and tissue remodeling factors, collectively known as Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). By leveraging existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of murine brain tumors, we identified a population of Cdkn2a-positive TAMs involved in immune regulation and neurogenesis, characterized by high expression of Emb and Cd93, which we named MECC (Microglia-like, and Emb-, CD93- and Cdkn2a-positive) cells. In humans, these cells were more prevalent in recurrent glioblastoma and associated with poorer prognosis. Comparative analysis of brain samples from patients with neurodegeneration and healthy older individuals revealed the specificity of MECCs for brain tumors. These findings suggest that MECCs are a unique and distinct cell population associated with aggressive brain tumors, which could potentially serve as targets for novel treatments.">

        <tr id="Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders. One sentence summary Type I interferon sensing neutrophils accumulate in meninges of psychosocially stressed mice via skull bone marrow channels and are associated with the negative behavioral sequelae of stress; blockade of this pathway inhibits neutrophil trafficking and improves behavioral outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune profiling of Nipah virus (NiV) infection survivors is essential for advancing our understanding of NiV pathogenesis, improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and guiding public health efforts to prevent future outbreaks. There is currently limited data available on the immune response to NiV infection. We aimed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms involved in protection against NiV infection by analyzing the immune profiles of survivors of the Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India 2023. Immune cell populations were quantified and compared between survivors (up to 4 months post onset day of illness) and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore associations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes. Immune signatures common to all three cases were: a heretofore undescribed persistent lymphopenia including the CD4+ Treg compartment with the relative expansion of memory Tregs; trends indicative of global leukopenic modulation were observed in monocytes and granulocytes including an expansion of putatively immunosuppressive low-density granulocytes described recently in the context of severe COVID-19; altered mucosal homing with respect to integrin beta-7 (ITGB7) expressing subsets; increased mobilization of activated T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and plasmablasts in the early phase of infection. Comparative analysis based on clinical presentation and outcome yielded lower initial viremia, increased activated T-cell responses, expanded plasmablasts, and restoration of ITGB7 expressing CD8+ T-cells as possible protective signatures. This longitudinal study delineates putative protective signatures associated with milder NiV disease. It emphasizes the need for the development of immunotherapeutic interventions such as monoclonal antibodies to blunt early viremia and ameliorate pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are frequently observed to present persistent symptoms constituting what has been called “post-acute COVID-19 syndrome” (PACS) or “long COVID-19”. Some clinical risk factors have been identified to be associated with PACS development; however, specific mechanisms responsible for PACS pathology remain unknown. This study investigates clinical, immunological, and metabolomic risk factors associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) in 51 patients, assessed 7–19 months after acute infection. Among the participants, 62.7% were male and 37.2% were female, with an average age of 47.8 years. At the follow-up, 37.2% met the criteria for PACS, revealing significant differences in immunological and metabolomic profiles at the time of acute infection. Patients with PACS were characterized by elevated levels of mature low-density granulocytes (LDGs), interleukin-8 (IL-8), pyruvate, pseudouridine, and cystine. Baseline multivariate analysis showed increased pyruvate and decreased alpha tocopherol levels. At follow-up, there was a decrease in absolute B lymphocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid levels. These findings suggest that specific immunological and metabolomic markers during acute infection can help identify patients at higher risk of developing persistent PACS.">

Here, we used blood samples from a human influenza H3N2 challenge study to perform comprehensive multi-omic analyses. We detected remodeling of immune programs in innate immune cells after resolution of the infection that was proportional in magnitude to the level of prior viral load. We found changes associated with suppressed inflammation including decreased cytokine and AP-1 gene expression as well as decreased accessibility at AP-1 targets and interleukin-related gene promoter regions. We also found decreased histone deacetylase gene expression, increased MAP kinase gene expression, and increased accessibility at interferon-related gene promoter regions. Genes involved in inflammation and epigenetic-remodeling showed modulation of gene-chromatin site regulatory circuit activity. These results reveal a coordinated rewiring of the epigenetic landscape in innate immune cells induced by mild influenza virus infection.">

        <tr id="The increased incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, occurring in patients infected with severe influenza or SARS-CoV-2, suggests that antiviral immune responses create an environment permissive to fungal infection. Our recent evidence suggests that absence of the type I IFN receptor 2 subunit (IFNAR2) of the heterodimeric IFNAR1/2 receptor is allowing for this permissive immune environment of the lung through regulation of damage responses. Because damage is associated with poor outcome to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, this suggested that IFNAR2 may be involved in A. fumigatus susceptibility. In this study, we determined that absence of IFNAR2 resulted in increased inflammation, morbidity, and damage in the lungs in response to A. fumigatus challenge, whereas absence of IFNAR1 did not. Although the Ifnar2-/- mice had increased morbidity, we found that the Ifnar2-/- mice cleared more conidia compared with both wild-type and Ifnar1-/- mice. However, this early clearance did not prevent invasive disease from developing in the Ifnar2-/- mice as infection progressed. Importantly, by altering the inflamed environment of the Ifnar2-/- mice early during A. fumigatus infection, by neutralizing TNF-α, we were able to reduce the morbidity and fungal clearance in these mice back to wild-type levels. Together, our results establish a distinct role for IFNAR2 in regulating host damage responses to A. fumigatus and contributing to an A. fumigatus-permissive environment through regulation of inflammation. Specifically, our data reveal a role for IFNAR2 in regulating TNF-α-mediated damage and morbidity during A. fumigatus infection.">

Postmortem examination of the lung is a useful tool for understanding the immunopathogenesis of this virus. Lung autopsy samples from seven dead SARS-CoV-2 patients were obtained and evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stain to analyze the histopathological changes in those samples, on the other hand, Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used for detection of CD21, CD1a, CR1 (CD35), CD68, Myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD15, CD56, CD3, CD20, CD4, and CD8 cells markers. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse alveolar damage with extensive parenchymal architecture distortion, intravascular fibrin clot, deposition of collagen fibers, vascular congestions and blood vessels containing thrombi, pneumocyte type II with inflammatory cell infiltration. The IHC staining for the innate immune cells such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, Macrophages, and neutrophils showed a strong positive staining, while CD56 Natural killer (NK) cells showed negative staining. On the other hand, the specific immune cells including; CD20 B cells, CD3 T cells, and CD4 helper T cells, showed positive staining while CD8 Cytotoxic T cells showed negative staining. The lung autopsy samples from patients with COVID-19 confirmed the presence of APCs through the positive staining of CD21, CD1a, CD35, CD68, MPO, and CD15 expressed the virus recognition, proinflammatory cytokine production, and adaptive immune cells activation through CD3, CD4, and CD20 positive staining and the role of APCs in the severity of pulmonary infection and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection however the absence of the CD56 NK and CD8 cytotoxic T explains the worse infection status for the patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and is widespread over the world. This disease shows a 5.1% mortality. The understanding of the disease has expanded rapidly in many areas, including virological, epidemiological, clinical, and management dimensions. To better understand the inflammatory and immune profiles that impact the pathogenesis and development of severe COVID-19 symptoms, further studies are essential. This research aims to explore the inflammatory and adaptive immune responses associated with COVID-19, considering factors such as genetic diversity and environmental exposure among Saudi patients. The goal is to determine if patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit different disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: This case-control study includes 115 participants (healthy and with COVID-19 infection), 55 of which had confirmed cases of COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICUs) at different hospitals in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia. Whole blood samples were collected from June to September 2021 for cellular analyses, and inflammation marker data were collected from hospital records. The expression of activation markers on B (CD27 and CD38) and T cells (CD27 and HLA-DR) was obtained using the flow cytometry technique. Also, serum was collected for cytokine measurements, including IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF- α. Results: The results indicated that lymphopenia and excessive T cell activation were more prevalent in severe cases than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the results revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had an increased frequency of CD19+ B cells, with changes in B cell subsets. The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers with pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers in severe COVID-19 cases, which could be targeted for therapeutic interventions. This might be a valuable approach for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Microglial cells are the phagocytic cells of the brain that under physiological conditions participate in brain homeostasis and surveillance. Under pathogenic states, microglia undergoes strong morphological and transcriptional changes potentially leading to sustained neuroinflammation, brain damage, and cognitive disorders. Postnatal and adult Zika virus (ZIKV) brain infection is characterized by the induction of reactive microglia associated with brain inflammation, synapse loss and neuropathogenesis. Contrary to neurons, microglial cells are not infected by ZIKV thus raising the question of the mechanism governing ZIKV-induced microglia's reactivity. In this work, we have questioned the role of exogenous, neuronal type I interferons (IFNs-I) in regulating ZIKV-induced microglia's reactivity. Primary cultured microglial cells were either treated with conditioned media from ZIKV-infected mature neurons or co-cultured with ZIKV-infected neurons. Using either an antibody directed against the IFNAR receptor that neutralizes the IFNs-I response or Ifnar-/-microglial cells, we demonstrate that IFNs-I produced by ZIKV-infected neurons are the main regulators of the phagocytic capacity and the pro-inflammatory gene expression profile of reactive, non-infected microglial cells. We identify protein kinase R (PKR), whose expression is activated by IFNs-I, as a major regulator of the phagocytic capacity, pro-inflammatory response, and morphological changes of microglia induced by IFNs-I while up-regulating STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression. Results obtained herein in vitro with primary cultured cells and in vivo in ZIKV-infected adult immunocompetent mice, unravel a role for IFNs-I and PKR in directly regulating microglia's reactivity that could be at work in other infectious and non-infectious brain pathologies.">

        <tr id="This study aimed to investigate the impact of different types of nasal inflammation on the regulation of entry-associated genes of respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and influenza virus, in the nasal epithelium. Subjects were classified into three groups: control, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), and noneosinophilic CRS (NECRS) groups. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2), alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1), and beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3GAL4) were selected as key entry-associated genes for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, MERS-CoV, and influenza, respectively, and were evaluated. Brushing samples obtained from each group and human nasal epithelial cells cultured using an air-liquid interface system were treated for 7 days with typical inflammatory cytokines and analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy were performed. The entry-associated genes showed distinct regulation patterns in response to each interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-13 (IL-13), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Specifically, ACE2 significantly decreased in type 2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), while TMPRSS2 significantly decreased in type 1 cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ). ANPEP significantly decreased in both types of cytokines. Remarkably, DPP4 significantly increased in type 2 cytokines and decreased in type 1 cytokines. Moreover, ST6GAL1 and ST3GAL4 significantly increased in type 2 cytokines and decreased in type 1 cytokines, particularly IFN-γ. These findings were supported by western blot analysis and confocal imaging results, especially for ACE2 and DPP4. The findings regarding differential regulation suggest that patients with ECRS, primarily mediated by type 2 inflammation, may have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infections but higher susceptibility to MERS-CoV and influenza infections.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a significant global health concern due to its association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This study aimed to compare the replication kinetics, viral persistence, cytopathogenic effects, and immune gene expression in human microglia cells (CHME-3) infected with an Asian lineage ZIKV (PRVABC59, referred to as ZIKV-PRV) and an African lineage ZIKV (IBH30656, referred to as ZIKV-IBH). We found that ZIKV-PRV replicated more efficiently and persisted longer while inducing lower levels of cell death and inflammatory gene activation compared with ZIKV-IBH. These findings suggest that the enhanced replication and persistence of ZIKV-PRV, along with its ability to evade innate immune responses, may underlie its increased neuropathogenic potential, especially in the context of CZS. In contrast, ZIKV-IBH, with its stronger immune gene activation and higher cytopathogenicity, may lead to more acute infections with faster viral clearance, thereby reducing the likelihood of chronic central nervous system (CNS) infection. This study provides crucial insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving the differential pathogenicity of ZIKV lineages and highlights the need for further research to pinpoint the viral factors responsible for these distinct clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Mitochondria are vital for most cells' functions. Viruses hijack mitochondria machinery for misappropriation of energy supply or to bypass defense mechanisms. Many of these mitochondrial dysfunctions persist after recovery from treated or untreated viral infections, particularly when mitochondrial DNA is permanently damaged. Quantitative defects and structural rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA accumulate in post-mitotic tissues as recently reported long after SARS-CoV-2 or HIV infection, or following antiviral therapy. These observations are consistent with the "hit-and-run" concept proposed decades ago to explain viro-induced cell transformation and it could apply to delayed post-viral onsets of symptoms and advocate for complementary supportive care. Thus, according to this concept, following exposure to viruses or antiviral agents, mitochondrial damage could evolve into an autonomous clinical condition. It also establishes a pathogenic link between communicable and non-communicable chronic diseases.">

        <tr id="Microglia are innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). They extend their processes towards and migrate towards injuries in vivo. However, whether the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) influences microglial migration remains unknown. Label-free proteomic profiling predicted changes in RHO-signaling activity that hint at dysregulated cytoskeleton signaling in Cx3cr1-deficient murine cortex tissue. To further investigate microglial migration, we carried out 4-hour interval two-photon in vivo imaging for 72 hours after a laser lesion in the cortex. Cx3cr1-deficient microglia showed enhanced migration towards the lesion. Additionally, length and velocity of microglial fine processes extending towards the lesion were increased in Cx3cr1-deficient microglia. Migration remained unchanged in Ccr2-deficient mice, indicating that monocyte-derived macrophages/microglia did not contribute to microglia accumulation around the lesion. These results demonstrate microglia migration towards CNS injury and suggest CX3CR1 as a modulator of this. Manipulating microglia migration via CX3CR1 therefore is a potential target for treatment of CNS-injury.">

This has elicited an immediate need for accelerated research into its mechanisms of disease, criteria for diagnosis, methods for forecasting outcomes, and treatment approaches. microRNAs (miRNAs), are diminutive RNA molecules, that are non-coding and participate in gene expression regulation post-transcriptionally, having an important participation in regulating immune processes. miRNAs have granted substantial interest in their impact on viral replication, cell proliferation, and modulation of how the host’s immune system responds. This narrative review delves into host miRNAs’ multifaceted roles within the COVID-19 context, highlighting their involvement in disease progression, diagnostics, and prognostics aspects, given their stability in biological fluids and varied expression profiles when responding to an infection. Additionally, we discuss complicated interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and host cellular machinery facilitated by host miRNAs revealing how dysregulation of host miRNA expression profiles advances viral replication, immune evasion, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, it investigates the potential of host miRNAs as therapeutic agents, whether synthetic or naturally occurring, which could be harnessed to either mitigate harmful inflammation or enhance antiviral responses. However, searching more deeply is needed to clarify how host’s miRNAs are involved in pathogenesis of COVID-19, its diagnosis processes, prognostic assessments, and treatment approaches for patients.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the residential immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) exhibited in multiple states from resting to activated, play a significant role in neurogenesis, myelination, synaptic transmission, immune surveillance, and neuroinflammation. The aggravated inflammatory response by microglia triggers the generation of superoxide, which often causes the degeneration of neurons, leading to the development of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. The oxidative stress is key to many neurological disorders, often regulated by many genes. The terminal neutralization of oxidative stress is mediated by NADPH and glutathione. The cytosolic NADPH level is majorly contributed by a key enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The deficiency of G6PD is associated with hemolytic anemia, diabetes, cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurological disorders. Our recent study indicated that G6PD deficiency decreases cytosolic NADPH levels and alters redox homeostasis and lysosomal function in microglia. Therefore, replenishment of NADPH is crucial for targeting G6PD deficiency-mediated microglial dysfunctions. This research promotes alternate metabolic pathways by targeting the expression and activity of enzymes such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and malic enzyme 1 (ME1), which are responsible for cytoplasmic NADPH production. Metabolites like citric and malic acid supplementation promote NADPH production and reduce microglial oxidative stress. Additionally, using another group of small-molecule metabolites, such as dieckol and resveratrol, enhances the expression of IDH1 and ME1 enzymes to resolve potential tissue heterogeneity. Finally, combining these metabolites supplementation increased NADPH production and restored redox homeostasis and lysosomal function in G6PD deficient microglia, indicating their further use as potential therapeutics against G6PD deficiency disorders.

        <tr id="Background: Long COVID-19 is an emerging chronic illness of significant public health concern due to a myriad of neuropsychiatric sequelae, including increased suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB). Methods: This review provides a concise synthesis of clinical evidence that points toward the dysfunction of astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the central nervous system, as a potential shared pathology between SI/SB and COVID-19. Results: Depression, a suicide risk factor, and SI/SB were both associated with reduced frequencies of various astrocyte subsets and complex proteomic/transcriptional changes of astrocyte-related markers in a brain-region-specific manner. Astrocyte-related circulating markers were increased in depressed subjects and, to a less consistent extent, in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, reactive astrocytosis was observed in subjects with SI/SB and those with COVID-19. Conclusions: Astrocyte dysfunctions occurred in depression, SI/SB, and COVID-19. Reactive-astrocyte-mediated loss of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity and subsequent neuroinflammation—a factor previously linked to SI/SB development—might contribute to increased suicide in individuals with long COVID-19. As such, the formulation of new therapeutic strategies to restore astrocyte homeostasis, enhance BBB integrity, and mitigate neuroinflammation may reduce SI/SB-associated neuropsychiatric manifestations among long COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

Variations in HLA genotypes across individuals lead to differences in susceptibility to viral infection and severity of illness. This study uses observations from the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how specific HLA class I molecules affect clinical responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By analyzing paired high-resolution HLA types and viral genomic sequences from 60 patients, we assess the relationship between predicted HLA class I peptide binding repertoires and infection severity as measured by the sequential organ failure assessment score. This approach leverages functional convergence across HLA-C alleles to identify relationships that may otherwise be inaccessible due to allelic diversity and limitations in sample size. Surprisingly, our findings show that severely symptomatic infection in this cohort is associated with disproportionately abundant binding of SARS-CoV-2 structural and non-structural protein epitopes by patient HLA-C molecules. In addition, the extent of overlap between a given patient’s predicted HLA-C and HLA-A peptide binding repertoires correlates with worse prognoses in this cohort. The findings highlight immunologic mechanisms linking HLA-C molecules with the human response to viral pathogens that warrant further investigation.">

Understanding the compendium of proteins defining cellular permissiveness is key to many questions in fundamental virology. Here, we apply a multiomic approach to determine the proteins that are associated with highly permissive, intermediate, and hostile cellular states. We observed two groups of differentially regulated genes: i) with robust changes in mRNA and protein levels, and ii) with protein/RNA discordances. Many of the latter are classified as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) but have no reported antiviral activity. This suggests that IFN-dependent changes in mRNA levels do not imply antiviral function. Phosphoproteomics revealed an additional regulatory layer involving non-signalling proteins with altered phosphorylation. Indeed, we confirmed that several permissiveness-associated proteins with changes in abundance or phosphorylation regulate infection fitness. Altogether, our study provides a comprehensive and systematic map of the cellular alterations driving virus susceptibility.">

We further conclude that a significant fraction of the T cell epitopes is conserved at a level associated with cross-reactivity between avian and seasonal sequences, and we further experimentally demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity in the most dominant T cell epitopes curated in the IEDB. Based on these observations, and the overall similarity of the neuraminidase (NA) N1 subtype encoded in both HPAI and seasonal H1N1 influenza virus as well as cross-reactive group 1 HA stalk-reactive antibodies, we expect that a degree of pre-existing immunity is present in the general human population that could blunt the severity of human H5N1 infections.">

        <tr id="Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) cause many skin diseases, particularly in immunocompromised patients. HSV-1 infection of murine skin recapitulates many aspects of human pathology. However, many protocols rely on mechanical or enzymatic skin disruption to induce lesions, although this can alter skin homeostasis and prime antiviral inflammation before inoculation. To investigate the initial events following HSV-1 primary skin infection before the onset of symptoms, we developed a novel murine ex vivo explant model using gentle depilation but no further scarification and infected keratinocytes from the outside with minimal tissue damage. Two-photon microscopy studies showed that HSV-1 spread exclusively in the epidermis. The infection centers increased in number and size over time and contained hundreds of infected keratinocytes. We investigated the HSV-1 spread at the cellular level, using reporter strains with fluorescently-tagged capsid protein VP26, and monitored the formation of nuclear capsid assembly sites, nuclear capsid egress, and the recruitment of the inner tegument protein pUL37GFP, the outer tegument protein VP11/12GFP, and the envelope protein gDGFP to cytoplasmic capsids. By electron microscopy, the skin appeared intact, and keratinocytes contained many nuclear capsids, primary virions in the nuclear envelope, cytosolic membrane-associated capsids, and enveloped virions. Our protocol provides a robust and reproducible approach to investigate the very early events of HSV-1 spread in the skin, to characterize the phenotypes of HSV-1 mutants in terminally differentiated skin tissues, and to evaluate potentially antiviral small molecules in a preclinical ex vivo infection model. IMPORTANCE This study describes a novel murine ex vivo skin explant model to investigate early events in HSV-1 infection without causing significant tissue damage. To infect from the outside, via the apical keratinocytes, this method relies on gentle depilation, which maintains skin integrity. HSV-1 spread exclusively within the epidermis, with infection centers growing over time and involving hundreds of keratinocytes. Using advanced microscopy techniques, we tracked HSV-1 spread at the cellular level and intracellular assembly of all intermediate virus structures. This model offers a valuable tool for studying the initial stages of HSV-1 infection, assessing viral mutant phenotypes, and testing antiviral compounds in a more physiological context to provide critical insights into HSV-1 pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused COVID-19 devastated families, social structures, and economies worldwide. This pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems, increased deaths and disabilities, and triggered a global socio-economic crisis. Although the COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, their effectiveness significantly decreased by the end of 2021 due to mutated viruses evading the immune system. As a result, despite high vaccination rates in industrialized countries, significant outbreaks occurred due to immune evasion associated with viral mutations. Over 300 clinical studies have shown that vitamin D (and ivermectin) are widely available and economical agents that promote immune system function. Proper doses of vitamin D effectively prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2, reducing complications, hospitalizations, and deaths by approximately 50%. Those with vitamin D deficiency fare the worse. SARS-CoV-2 activates the renin-angiotensin system by increasing renin expression, leading to elevated levels of the inflammatogenic and vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin-II. SARS-CoV-2 viruses cause widespread inflammation, blood clots, and lung damage through multiple mechanisms, leading to impaired tissue oxygenation and death. In addition to enhancing the immune system, vitamin D increases ACE-2 enzyme levels, which breaks down angiotensin-II and reduces SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation. It also lowers blood pressure and mitigates abnormal clotting. While the virus enters human cells through ACE-2 receptors, excess ACE-2 spills into the bloodstream and neutralizes viruses.

        <tr id="Background IL-26 is a key mediator of pulmonary host defense given its abundant expression in human airways and its established antibacterial properties. Moreover, recent studies indicate that IL-26 can also inhibit viral replication. Along these lines, we have previously reported an increase in the plasma concentration of IL-26 among patients with acute COVID-19 that is linked to harmful hyperinflammation. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether this systemic increase in IL-26 relates to disease severity, sex, comorbidities, viral load, or the innate immune response in acute COVID-19. Methods IL-26 was quantified using ELISA in plasma samples from a large cohort of well-characterized patients with acute COVID-19 (n=178) and healthy controls (n=30). The plasma concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike protein, as well as those of IFN-α2a, IFN-β, and IFN-γ, were determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The concentration of double-stranded DNA was determined using fluorometry. Results The plasma concentration of IL-26 was increased in patients with severe/critical COVID-19, particularly among males and patients with comorbid obstructive lung disease. Moreover, the concentration of IL-26 displayed positive correlations with length of hospital stay, as well as with systemic markers of viral load, antiviral immunity, and extracellular DNA. Conclusions Systemic IL-26 is involved in severe COVID-19, especially in males and patients with comorbid obstructive lung disease. These findings argue that systemic IL-26 has pathogenic and antiviral relevance, as well as biomarker potential.">

        <tr id="Significance Uveitis is a common vision-threatening disease involving the iris, ciliary body, choroid, retina, and their blood vessels. The results from our previous Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) study suggest that early growth response 2 (EGR2) genes may modulate the risk of developing Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease and Behcet’s disease. In this study, we first identified the impact of ERG2 in retinal microglia in a murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) model. Then, microglia-specific, conditional ERG2 knockout (KO) mice were generated to validate the role of this gene. Next, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was identified as a target of ERG2 by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Finally, intravitreal injection of recombinant GDF15 protein has been shown to alleviate EAU progression in vivo, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for future clinical use.">

        <tr id="Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by protein rich edema due to alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction caused by inflammatory processes. Currently, our understanding of the inflammatory response in patients with ARDS is mainly based on assessment of the systemic compartment and preclinical studies. Investigations into the intricate network of immune cells and their critical functions in the alveolar compartment remain limited. However, with recent improvements in single cell analyses, our comprehensive understanding of the interactions between immune cells in the lungs has improved. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the cellular composition and interactions of different immune cell types within the alveolar space of patients with ARDS. Neutrophils and macrophages are the predominant immune cells in the alveolar space of ARDS patients. Yet, all immune cells present, including lymphocytes, participate in complex interactions, coordinate recruitment, modulate the lifespan and control apoptosis through various signaling pathways. Moreover, the cellular composition of alveolar immune cells is associated with clinical outcomes of ARDS patients. In conclusion, this synthesis advances our understanding of ARDS immunology, emphasizing the crucial role of immune cells within the alveolar space. Associations between cellular composition and clinical outcomes highlight the significance of exploring distinct alveolar immune cell subsets. Such exploration holds promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets in ARDS pathophysiology, presenting avenues for enhancing clinical management and treatment strategies for ARDS patients.

        <tr id="Mpox, the zoonotic disease caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), is currently a global health emergency. This review (Part I) aims to provide insights into the virus life cycle, epidemiology, host immune responses, and immune evasion mechanisms. Mpox symptoms is similar to smallpox but with lower mortality rates and lower transmissibility. In the past, the virus has been endemic in Central (Clade I) and West (Clade II) African countries. The first outbreak in outside Africa is reported in the United States in 2003. A multi-country outbreak across all continents occurred in 2022, predominantly driven by Clade II. Recently, the emergence of Clade Ib with sustained person-to-person transmission characteristic in the 2023-2024 outbreaks has raised significant public health concerns. Its apparent capacity for rapid spread and potential for causing severe disease highlight the need for enhanced surveillance, especially in regions not traditionally affected by Mpox. Immune responses induced by MPXV infection in humans and animal models provide the insights into the key step in which the host immune response recognizes and responds to the infection. The sophisticated immune evasion strategy by MPXV at both innate and adaptive arms also emerges that are useful for vaccine-based control measures. Taken together, understanding MPXV life cycle, epidemiology and immune response will facilitate better control, limit viral spread, and provide important insights for vaccine development.">

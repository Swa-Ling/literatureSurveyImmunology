        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The dynamics of the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) breakthrough infections remain unclear, particularly when compared to responses in naive individuals. In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, 13 participants were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected every other day until day 7 after symptom onset. Transcriptome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing, Olink proteomics, and antigen-antibody binding experiments were then performed. During the incubation periods of breakthrough infections, peripheral blood exhibited type 2 cytokine response, which shifted to type 1 cytokine response upon symptom onset. Plasma cytokine levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 show larger changes in breakthrough infections than naïve infections. The inflammatory response in breakthrough infections rapidly subsided, returning to homeostasis by day 5 after symptom onset. Notably, the levels of monocyte-derived S100A8/A9, previously considered a marker of severe disease, physiologically significantly increased in the early stages of mild cases and persisted until day 7, suggesting a specific biological function. Longitudinal tracking also revealed that antibodies anti-Receptor Binding Domain (anti-RBD) in breakthrough infections significantly increased by day 7 after symptom onset, whereas cytotoxic T lymphocytes appeared by day 5. This study presents a reference for interpreting the immunological response to breakthrough infectious disease in humans.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T-cells are essential for controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet their antigen-specific resolution in relation to disease severity, functional dynamics during acute infection, and long-term memory formation remain incompletely understood. Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is a heterogeneous clinical condition of uncertain etiology triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we used ultrasensitive approaches to profile the immune system and the plasma proteome in healthy convalescent individuals and individuals with long COVID, spanning geographically independent cohorts from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Symptomatic disease was not consistently associated with quantitative differences in immune cell lineage composition or antiviral T cell immunity. Healthy convalescent individuals nonetheless exhibited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than individuals with long COVID, and extensive phenotypic analyses revealed a subtle increase in the expression of some co-inhibitory receptors, most notably PD-1 and TIM-3, among SARS-CoV-2 nonspike-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with long COVID. We further identified a shared plasma biomarker signature of disease linking breathlessness with apoptotic inflammatory networks centered on various proteins, including CCL3, CD40, IKBKG, IL-18 and IRAK1, and dysregulated pathways associated with cell cycle progression, lung injury and platelet activation, which could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that plays a role in orchestrating innate immune responses, particularly in response to viral infections. Notably, IRF5 has been identified as a microglia risk gene linked to multiple sclerosis (MS), but its specific role in MS pathogenesis remains unclear. Through the use of Irf5-/- mice, our study uncovers a non-canonical function of IRF5 in MS recovery. Irf5-/- mice exhibited increased damage in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and demonstrated impaired oligodendrocyte recruitment into the lesion core following lysolecithin-induced demyelination. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed that IRF5 has a role in microglia-mediated myelin phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and cholesterol homeostasis. Indeed, Irf5-/- microglia phagocytose myelin, but myelin debris is not adequately degraded, leading to an accumulation of lipid droplets, cholesterol esters, and cholesterol crystals within demyelinating lesions. This abnormal buildup can hinder remyelination processes. Importantly, treatments that promote cholesterol transport were found to reduce lipid droplet accumulation and mitigate the exacerbated damage in Irf5-/- mice with EAE. Altogether, our study identified the antiviral transcription factor IRF5 as a key transcriptional regulator of lipid degradation and cholesterol homeostasis and suggest that loss of IRF5 function leads to pathogenic lipid accumulation in microglia, thereby obstructing remyelination. These data and the fact that Irf5 polymorphisms are significantly associated with MS, highlight IRF5 as a potential therapeutic target to promote regenerative responses.

        <tr id="Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was repurposed to treat COVID-19 based on its in vitro antiviral effects. However, it was abandoned after multiple clinical trials reported a lack of efficacy. Immunomodulatory effects have been proposed but remain unclear, yet they may be relevant given IVM use for other infections. We assessed the IVM immunomodulatory effect in 24 participants from a clinical trial evaluating its potential to reduce COVID-19 transmission in mild cases within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM-treated patients showed non-significant lower viral loads, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We measured IgG, IgA, and IgM against five SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and 30 cytokines by Luminex, alongside whole blood RNA sequencing, pan-leukocyte immunophenotyping, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell analysis by flow cytometry from day 1 to day 28 post-treatment. All antibody responses increased from day 4, while 13 cytokines significantly decreased over time (adjusted p<0.05). IVM-treated patients had only significantly higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels at day 4 (adjusted p=0.041) and 7 (adjusted p=0.045) compared to placebo. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased over time, with significantly higher effector memory CD4+ T cells at day 7 compared to day 1 (p=0.027) and the only difference between groups was lower frequencies of spike-specific naïve CD4+ T cells at day 7 in IVM-treated participants (0.006% vs 0.036% p=0.02). Transcriptomic data showed downregulation of innate and antiviral blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) over time, with an increase in adaptive immune related BTMs. While no differential gene expression was detected, the IVM-treated had upregulated innate and downregulated T cell and cell cycle BTMs compared to placebo. Overall, our comprehensive longitudinal analysis of early immune responses in mild COVID-19 revealed no robust immunological effects of IVM, consistent with clinical trials results and suggesting a lack of efficacy of IVM in COVID-19 treatment. AUTHOR SUMMARY Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was tested in clinical trials as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due to its in vitro antiviral properties and hypothetical immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory effects of IVM in a clinical trial involving 24 mild COVID-19 patients who received IVM within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM group showed a trend towards lower viral loads post-treatment, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We comprehensively analyzed immune responses by measuring antibody levels, cytokine profiles, immune cell subsets and whole blood gene expression over 28 days. The IVM group only had increased levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid compared to the control group. IVM did not affect the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 T cells, despite a slight decrease in naive CD4+ T cells. Additionally, gene expression analysis showed a decrease in innate and antiviral responses and an increase of adaptive responses over time that were slightly stronger in the placebo compared to the IVM group. In conclusion, despite some differences in IVM treated participants, our detailed analyses do not support significant immunomodulatory effects that could benefit disease progression.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

The FDA-approved coronavirus antiviral Paxlovid targets the essential SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro. Whilst effective in the acute phase of a COVID infection, Paxlovid cannot be used by all patients, can lead to viral recurrence, and does not protect against post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known as long COVID, an emerging significant health burden that remains poorly understood and untreated. Alternative antivirals that are addressing broader patient needs are urgently required. We here report our drug discovery efforts to target PLpro, a further essential coronaviral protease, for which we report a novel chemical scaffold that targets SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with low nanomolar activity, and which exhibits activity against PLpro of other pathogenic coronaviruses. Our lead compound shows excellent in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of severe acute disease. Importantly, our mouse model recapitulates long-term pathologies matching closely those seen in PASC patients. Our lead compound offers protection against a range of PASC symptoms in this model, prevents lung pathology and reduces brain dysfunction. This provides proof-of-principle that PLpro inhibition may have clinical relevance for PASC prevention and treatment going forward.">

        <tr id="Viral encephalitis, resulting from neurotropic viral infections, leads to severe neurological impairment, inflammation, and exhibits high mortality rates with poor prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of effective targeted treatments for this disease, which poses a significant public health concern. SARM1 has been identified as the pivotal mediator of axonal degeneration and inflammation across various neuropathies, activated by an elevation in the NMN/NAD+ ratio. However, comprehensive in vivo investigations into the role of SARM1-mediated pathogenesis in viral encephalitis are still lacking. In this study, we established mouse models of viral encephalitis using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and rabies virus (RABV) as representative pathogens. Our findings demonstrate that neurotropic virus infections elicit robust axonal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and profound neuropathological damage in cortical neurons via the activation of SARM1. In mouse models of viral encephalitis, deletion or inhibition of SARM1 effectively preserved axonal morphology and maintained mitochondrial homeostasis, while also attenuating the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes in the cortex. Consequently, these interventions ameliorated neuropathological damage and enhanced survival outcomes in mice. Our findings suggest that SARM1-mediated axonal degeneration and brain inflammation exacerbate the pathological progression of viral encephalitis. Therapies targeting SARM1 emerge as viable and promising strategies for protecting neuronal function in the context of neurotropic viral infections.

        <tr id="With the continuous emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, long-lasting and broadly reactive cellular and humoral immunity is critical for durable protection from COVID-19. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants. These findings suggest a functional role of CoV-cross-reactive T cells that extends beyond the initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, contributing to enhanced immunity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can cause neurological symptoms, but the underlying neurotropic mechanisms are unclear. Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics. In summary, human astrocytes, but not neurons, contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, highlighting the potential benefits of ketamine treatment in coronavirus infections.">

        <tr id="Given the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the historical emergence of other highly transmissible coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63, in vivo coronavirus research remains crucial even when the COVID-19 pandemic is receding. Due to restricted tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses for mouse cells, model systems of infection rely on transgenic expression of the entry receptor human ACE2 (hACE2). Available hACE2 transgenic models using the Krt18 promotor express the receptor across multiple cell types and organ systems, leading to multiple disease features including pneumonia, vascular compromise and neuro-inflammation, that reflect the multi-organ nature of COVID-19. To disentangle the role of cell tropism in driving the clinical manifestations of the disease, we generated two new transgenic mouse models, Sftpa1-hACE2 and Cdh5-hACE2 transgenic mice, with hACE2 restricted to lung epithelium or endothelial cells respectively. In Sftpa1-hACE2 mice, with high expression of the hACE2 receptor in lung alveolar type 2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection led to rapidly progressing disease, characterised by a strong neutrophilic innate immune response in the lung, followed by viral neuro-invasion and early death. Krt18-hACE2 mice additionally recruited various dendritic cell subsets and gradually developed adaptive immunity. In Cdh5-hACE2 Tg mice with exclusive endothelial tropism of the virus, viral inoculation via the lung or systemic circulation did not lead to viral propagation or disease manifestations, despite endothelial expression of hACE2 in the lung. These results suggest that tropism for alveolar epithelial cells increases disease severity, while endothelial cell tropism per se does not drive the vascular consequences often seen in COVID-19 patients. Our new transgenic mouse models will be helpful to dissect how cell tropism contributes to the clinical manifestations of coronavirus infection.">

        <tr id="Viral replication in endothelial cells is a hallmark of many viral diseases in humans and other animals, underscoring the importance of understanding cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication and the associated consequences for vascular health. Pathogenic variants of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV, Isavirus salaris) target endothelial cells of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), causing severe systemic disease and major losses during outbreaks in aquaculture. To better understand the endothelial response to ISAV, we used single nucleus RNA-sequencing at pre-clinical (12 days post infection, dpi) and clinical (16 dpi) stages of infection. Our approach enables an assessment of transcriptomic responses for different endothelial subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. ISAV RNA was predominantly detected in endothelial cells, which, along with mononuclear phagocytes, showed the highest number of differentially regulated genes at both time points. At 12 dpi, differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells were enriched for pathways related to NOD-like receptor signaling, antiviral responses, and regulation of programmed cell death. By 16 dpi, we observed a shift toward enrichment of pathways associated with cellular senescence, apelin signaling, and insulin signaling. We identified two distinct infection-related states at both time points: a virus-permissive state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, small GTPase signaling, and MAPK activity, and a bystander phenotype marked by activation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and translational regulation. This study is the first to capture the individual cell type responses to ISAV infection, and to characterize the in vivo endothelial response to active viral replication at single-cell resolution in any species.">

Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer-and region-specificity. In Parkinson’s disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The spike S1 subunit induces inflammatory cytokine production, but the immune cell subsets that respond to S1 stimulation and contribute to disease severity remain unclear. Methods We analyzed serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 (moderate: n = 7; severe: n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 38). Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement. The frequency of CD147hi cMono showed a stronger positive correlation with clinical severity markers in younger patients compared to older patients. Conclusions CD147hi cMono are the primary cellular source of S1-induced inflammatory cytokines and may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity and treatment response.

        <tr id="The appearance of diabetes-associated autoantibodies is the first detectable sign of the disease process leading to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Evidence suggests that T1D is a heterogenous disease, where the type of antibodies first formed imply subtypes. Here, we followed 49 children, who subsequently presented with T1D and 49 matched controls, profiling single-cell epigenomics at different time points of disease development. Quantitation of cell and nuclei populations as well as transcriptome and open-chromatin states indicated robust, early, replicable monocyte lineage differences between cases and controls, suggesting heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion early among cases. The order of autoantibody emergence in cases showed variation across lymphoid and myeloid cells, potentially indicating cellular immune response divergence. The strong monocytic lineage representation in peripheral blood immune cells before seroconversion and the weaker differential coordination of these gene networks close to clinical diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early life as a critical phase in T1D development.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, including prolonged viral shedding and emergence of mutations. To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT JC Polyomavirus is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often-fatal demyelinating disease. Unfortunately, a diagnosis of PML occurs only after patients have suffered irreversible neuropathologies. The first step in the initiation of PML is viral entry to the brain, but the route and mechanisms responsible for neuroinvasion have not been well established. To gain a better understanding of this, we asked whether purified virus or virus associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) could penetrate two different cell culture models of the blood-brain barrier. In one model, we used the hCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cell line, and in the other, we used pluripotent stem cells induced to a brain endothelial cell phenotype (iPSC-EC). We found that neither cell type was permissive to viral infection, but the virus bound and was internalized by both in a sialic acid-dependent manner. Despite virus internalization into these cells, very few virions or virus-associated extracellular vesicles (virus-EVs) penetrated the barriers. The small amount of virus or virus-EVs that did pass through either barrier was sufficient to establish infection in human glial cells. Our findings demonstrate that limited amounts of infectious virions and virus-associated EVs can traverse the brain microvascular endothelium and establish infection. IMPORTANCE The human polyomavirus, JC Polyomavirus (JCPyV), causes a rapidly progressing demyelinating disease in immunocompromised or immunomodulated patients. Demyelinating lesions are often seen surrounding blood vessels in the brain. In this paper, we used two models to recapitulate a minimal blood-brain barrier and found that both were highly restrictive of virus penetration. A small amount of virus succeeded in crossing both barriers and was sufficient to establish infection of human glia. These data have direct implications for mechanisms used by JCPyV to invade the CNS and cause neurological disease.">

        <tr id="Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a principal environmental risk factor contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and can be causally linked to ASD symptoms. In our study, we found that MIA triggered by poly (I: C) injection caused ventriculomegaly in offspring due to the dysfunction of the choroid plexus (Chp) and ependyma. We subsequently identified a sustained enhancement of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling in the brain and serum of MIA offspring. Further study revealed that increased IFN-γ signaling could disrupt the barrier function of Chp epithelial cells by activating macrophages, and suppress the differentiation of primary ependymal cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 signaling. The effects of MIA on the offspring were mitigated by administration of IFNGR-blocking antibody in pregnant dams, while systemic maternal administration of IFN-γ was sufficient to mimic the effect of MIA. Overall, our findings revealed that ventriculomegaly caused by IFN-γ signaling could be a critical factor in compromising fetal brain development in MIA-induced ASD and provide a mechanistic framework for the association between maternal inflammation and abnormal development of ventricles in the offspring.

        <tr id="The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly heterogeneous, with interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression playing a dual role in antiviral defense and immune dysregulation. To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and resulting coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) cause placental dysfunction, which increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. While abnormal placental pathology resulting from COVID‐19 is common, direct infection of the placenta is rare. This suggests that pathophysiology associated with maternal COVID‐19, rather than direct placental infection, is responsible for placental dysfunction. We hypothesized that maternal circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), altered by COVID‐19 during pregnancy, contribute to placental dysfunction. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized circulating EVs from pregnancies complicated by COVID‐19 and tested their effects on trophoblast cell physiology in vitro. Trophoblast exposure to EVs isolated from patients with an active infection (AI), but not controls, altered key trophoblast functions including hormone production and invasion. Thus, circulating EVs from participants with an AI, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, can disrupt vital trophoblast functions. EV cargo differed between participants with COVID‐19, depending on the gestational timing of infection, and Controls, which may contribute to the disruption of the placental transcriptome and morphology. Our findings show that COVID‐19 can have effects throughout pregnancy on circulating EVs, and circulating EVs are likely to participate in placental dysfunction induced by COVID‐19.">

We identified skewing in NK cell subsets towards higher frequencies of CD56bright cells caused by a reduced number of CD56dim cells in the peripheral blood during pregnancy and provide evidence for a role of chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, in NK cell activation. In addition, we defined a new cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced decidual NK cell population in CMV+ pregnancies with tissue-residency markers.

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally; however, the characterization of molecular biomarkers of severe disease remains of great scientific importance. The aim of this study was to capture the transcriptional differences of the whole blood gene expression between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease, using Next Generation Sequencing technologies, on admission and after 7 days. The genes which were differentially expressed in severe compared to mild patients were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gene expression data were used to estimate the cell abundance of 22 immune cell types via digital cytometry. GO terms related to the response to molecules of bacterial origin, such as intestine-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were enriched, among other dysregulated pathways, which are well described as paramount mechanisms of severe manifestations of COVID-19. The neutrophil population increased in patients with severe disease, whereas the monocyte, CD8+ T cell, and activated Natural Killer (NK) cell populations were depleted. These cell population dynamics are also indicative of severe COVID-19 and intestinal bacterial translocation. This study elucidates the molecular basis of severe COVID-19 and highlights intestinal bacterial translocation as a potential driver of severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="Introduction Porcine Circovirus (PCV2) infection is prevalent in pig farming and causes significant economic losses. In recent years, the PCV2d subtype has become the most prevalent genotype worldwide, exhibiting higher virulence, leading to more severe viremia and organ damage. Therefore, studying the biological characteristics of the PCV2d subtype is of great significance. Methods We established a PCV2d infection model using BALB/c mice and employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically analyze the transcriptome of 10 cell types in the lung tissues of infected mice. We developed a comprehensive marker gene catalog for these cell types. Results Compared to uninfected mice, PCV2d infection induced extensive viral replication and immunosuppressive responses in most cell types. Monocyte macrophages with high levels of viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various cell population interactions occurring through CD40-CD40L and CXCL14-CXCR4 were identified. These cells predominantly mediate antigen presentation and processing pathways in vivo, contributing to PCV2d-driven inflammatory lung injury. Discussion Our data uncovered a complex unique immune response scenario in the lung tissue of mice after PCV2d infection, deciphering the potential mechanisms underlying PCV2d-driven inflammatory responses in mice. Furthermore, this study provides a rich database for the molecular basis of different cell types' responses to PCV2d infection.">

        <tr id="Background Despite the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in reducing mortality and severe cases of COVID-19, a proportion of survivors experience long-term symptoms, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This study investigates the long-term immunological and neurodegenerative effects associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods 13 Controls and 20 COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, were recruited. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in both plasma and EVs. A deep-immunophenotyping of monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) was performed, along with immunostainings of SARS-CoV-2 in the colon. Results Higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilaments were found in EVs but not in plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon. Conclusions COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC. The cargo of EVs can be a promising tool for early detection of virus-induced neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Effective control of viral infection requires rapid induction of the innate immune response, especially the type I and type III interferon (IFN) systems. Despite the critical role of IFN induction in host defense, numerous studies have established that most cells fail to produce IFNs in response to viral stimuli. The specific factors that govern cellular heterogeneity in IFN induction potential during infection are not understood. To identify specific host factors that license some cells but not others to mount an IFN response to viral infection, we developed an approach for analyzing temporal scRNA-seq data of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. This approach identified the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) within pre-infection cells as correlates of IFN induction potential of those cells, post-infection. Validation experiments confirmed that intrinsic expression of the ISG OASL is essential for robust IFNL induction during IAV infection. Altogether, our findings reveal an important role for IFN-independent, intrinsic expression of ISGs in promoting IFN induction and provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell heterogeneity in innate immune activation.">

        <tr id="Background The mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after non-severe COVID-19 remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells of patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and assess if distinct clinical subtypes with specific gene signatures could be identified. Methods The cohort included 111 PCC patients from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant era, with 57 recovered (Recov) and 54 having prolonged symptoms indicative of PCC. The results were compared to 63 healthy controls (Ctrl) without known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data included patient assessments, laboratory results, comorbidities, and questionnaires on quality of life and functioning. Transcriptomic analysis and cellular deconvolution methods were used on total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results PCC patients had more comorbidities (mean 1.3) and more frequently (59%) at least one comorbidity than recovered patients (31%) and controls (24%). Overall, past COVID-19 illness or current PCC symptoms caused minimal changes in the blood cell transcriptome, with only 3–6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across comparisons. However, a subset of male PCC patients exhibited an increased fraction of deconvoluted erythroblasts and significant genome-wide gene expression changes, with 399 DEGs compared to recovered and control males. These genes were enriched in pathways related to heme metabolism and gas exchange in erythrocytes. Conclusions Persistent symptoms in PCC are multifactorial and not directly linked to peripheral blood cell gene expression changes. However, a subgroup of male PCC patients shows distinct erythrocyte responses that may contribute to long-term symptoms.">

        <tr id="Background Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome predominantly affecting children, with a propensity to induce coronary artery lesions. Aberrant immune activation and cytokines cascade reactions are involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in immune cell communication during the course of KD and to identify potential biomarkers. Methods The study enrolled seven pediatric patients diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease (KD) between December 2019 and December 2021. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was utilized to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Bioinformatics methods including quality control, dimensionality reduction, cell annotation, differential expression analysis, cell communication analysis, and co-expression network analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. Results This study utilized single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the dynamics of immune cell communication during the course of KD, revealing a significant increase in the number of CD14+ monocytes in the early stages of vasculitis, which play a central role in cell-cell communication. SELPLG was identified as a particularly crucial gene in the signal transduction among immune cells. The study also observed various cellular communication patterns of vasculitis at different time points and identified co-expression modules related to ribosomal function, cell proliferation, and immune responses in CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ monocytes. Notably, the expression of the ITK gene in CD14+ monocytes stood out. Furthermore, MHC-I genes were the most active molecules involved in signal transduction, and the expression of CD40 genes increased with the prolongation of vasculitis duration. Conclusion CD14+ monocytes play a pivotal role in cellular communication during the activation process of KD vasculitis, with SELPLG and ITK as important communication signal genes. These findings provide a novel perspective for the discovery of biomarkers, prediction of disease progression, and the development of targeted treatment strategies for KD.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for immune evasion. While initial studies focused on the Wuhan variant and adaptive immunity, later emerging strains such as Omicron exhibit mutations that may alter their immune-modulatory properties. We performed a comprehensive review of immune evasion mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to focus on the evolutionary dynamics of immune modulation. We systematically analyzed and compared the impact of all currently known Wuhan and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 proteins on type I interferon (IFN) responses using a dual-luciferase reporter assay carrying an interferon-inducible promoter. Results revealed that Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp14, and ORF6 are potent type I IFN inhibitors conserved across Wuhan and Omicron strains. Notably, we identified strain-specific differences, with Nsp6 and Spike proteins exhibiting enhanced IFN suppression in Omicron, whereas the Envelope protein largely retained this function. To extend these findings, we investigated selected proteins in primary human endothelial cells and also observed strain-specific differences in immune response with higher type I IFN response in cells expressing the Wuhan strain variant, suggesting that Omicron’s adaptational mutations may contribute to a damped type I IFN response in the course of the pandemic’s trajectory.">

Clinical patient data were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. COVID-19 positive patients were divided in two groups according to disease severity. The mean day difference between COVID-19 diagnosis date and sampling date was +11 days. Concentrations of TARC were lower in COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative patients (unpaired t-test, p=0.002). In addition, CC16 serum levels were significantly elevated in sera taken from patients that were admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) (p=0.0082). In a matched cohort, sera taken prior to ICU admission (-3 days) contained higher CC16 levels (paired t-test, p=0.0072). Multivariable analyses adjusted for known risk factors (age, gender, blood counts, lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, underlying disease) showed that CC16 levels were independently associated to COVID-19 severity (interquartile-range, odds ratio 1.53, p=0.0102). In conclusion, our findings highlight CC16 as a promising biomarker for early identification of severe COVID19 cases, which could improve patient management and resource allocation.">

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection leads to viral encephalitis and neurological damage in mice, causing significant neurological symptoms and brain damage. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms of PRV-induced encephalopathy and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We found that PRV infection increased the number of astrocytes and induced a phenotypic shift from the A2 to the A1 subtype, which was associated with increased secretion of MMP-9. MMP-9 was identified as a critical mediator of PRV-induced BBB disruption, as it degrades collagen VI, leading to BBB damage. PRV was shown to penetrate the BBB via a paracellular pathway, and MMP-9 deletion reversed this damage, mitigating tight junction injury. Additionally, PRV infection caused an “inflammatory storm” in the central nervous system (CNS), with increased levels of the chemokines CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCL-5; the cytokines IL-6 and IL-18; and TNF-α. The expression of INF-γ was significantly decreased. In conclusion, PRV infection disrupts the BBB and induces an inflammatory response in the CNS, with MMP-9 playing a key role in mediating BBB damage. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of PRV-induced encephalopathy and potential therapeutic targets for viral encephalitis.">

        <tr id="Background Long-COVID immunopathogenesis involves diverse factors. We longitudinally characterize hospitalized COVID-19 patients, examining the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and inflammation in immune dysregulation. Methods Hospitalized patients are evaluated during acute infection (T0), 3 months post-symptom onset (T1), and 3 years if symptoms persisted (T2). Immune profile includes characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-specific T/B cells (flow cytometry) and antibodies (ELISA, neutralization, ADCC). RNAemia and cytokines are quantified (RT-PCR, cytometric beads array) and correlated. Statistics: non-parametric cross-sectional, longitudinal and correlation analyses. Results Here we show 48 hospitalized individuals during acute COVID-19, 38 exhibit early persistent symptoms (EPS+) 3 months post-symptoms onset, 10 do not (EPS−). Groups are comparable for age, sex, co-morbidities. The EPS+ shows fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia/dysgeusia, diarrhea, chronic pain, mnestic disorders. Over time, they show a reduction of neutralization ability and total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, with increased total CD4 TEMRA, and failure to increase RBD-specific B cells and IgA+ MBCs. EPS+ patients show higher levels of T0-IFN-γ + CD4 TEMRA, T1-IL-2 + CD4 TEM and T1-TNF-α + CD4 cTfh. In EPS+, baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positively correlates with CD4 TEMRA, follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with ADCC. Among 38 EPS+ individuals at T1, 33 are evaluated 3 years after infection, 5 are lost at follow-up. 10/33 EPS+ show long-term symptoms (late persistent symptoms, EPS + LPS+), whereas 23/33 fully recover (EPS + LPS−). Antibodies, RNAemia, and cytokines show no differences between/within groups at any time point. Conclusions Early persistent symptoms are associated with multi-layered SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune dysregulation. The shift towards non-Ag-specific TEMRA and ADCC trigger in EPS+ may relate to SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Early immune dysregulation does not associate with long-term persistent symptoms. Further research on SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and early immune dysregulation is needed.">

        <tr id="Significance Severe COVID-19 is associated with uncontrolled inflammation, leading to acute respiratory distress. We found that mice deficient in platelets’ 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) demonstrate exacerbated inflammation and worse outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. One mediator derived from platelet 12-LOX activity, 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), was found to negatively correlate with disease severity. Taken together our data unravel a possible role of platelets and possibly 12-HETrE, which is documented as promoting anti-inflammatory effects, in dampening the inflammatory burden of infected mice and pinpoints potential new therapeutic strategies (12-LOX inhibitors or 12-HETrE receptor agonists) to better combat severe COVID-19.">

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are important tools in preventing severe disease, yet their efficacy post-transplant remains unclear, especially in patients subjected to myeloablative chemotherapy and immunosuppression. We evaluated humoral and adaptive immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination series in 42 HSCT recipients and 5 healthy controls. Post-vaccination responses were assessed by anti-spike IgG and nucleocapsid levels, and antigen specific T cell activity. Immune profiling was performed using clinical flow and mass cytometry. Patients were selected based on humoral and cellular responses for single-cell RNA with TCR and BCR sequencing. Our studies revealed defects in memory T cells that correlated with an absence of cellular response despite nearly universal humoral response. Several patients with a robust antibody response developed COVID-19 infection, but none developed severe disease or died from the infection.">

We further demonstrate through a series of in vitro assays that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-antibody immune complexes can stimulate NETosis.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Hypercapnia, an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) complication after pulmonary sepsis, remains enigmatic in terms of its immunological mechanisms. Our study was designed to compare initial values and longitudinal changes in cellular composition and inflammatory biomarkers between pneumonia sepsis-induced ARDS patients without hypercapnia and hypercapnia patients. Methods Between Dec 2022-Apr 2023, we prospectively studied 61 severe pneumonia patients. Eleven non-sepsis pneumonia patients were controls; 50 patients with pulmonary sepsis met ARDS criteria, 26 among them developed hypercapnia. We collected clinical data, respiratory parameters, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at Day 1 and Day 7 post-intubation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-seq) was performed between selected hypercapnia and non-hypercapnia patients to characterize immune and cellular profiles. Specimens were analyzed via flow cytometry and cytokine panel. Results By compiling clinical data and specimens, we found that hypercapnia patients with ARDS had poorer outcomes and higher mortality. At day 1, ScRNA-seq and cytometric analysis revealed increase in monocytes and activation of cytokine storm genes with elevated interleukin (IL) −1β, IL-12p40, and IL-23 in peripheral blood. In hypercapnia patients, percentage of CD14+CD16- classical monocyte and concentrations of IL-12p40 and IL-23 increased from day 1 to day 7 in both circulation and airways. However, these alterations of cellular phenotype and cytokine decreased during seven-treatment period in non-hypercapnia patients. Conclusion We offer novel perspectives on monocyte-centered clusters and associated biomarkers, which play a pivotal role in driving hypercapnia after pulmonary sepsis-induced ARDS. Our study provides fresh insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying hypercapnia in ARDS, laying the foundation for useful therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Currently, the Omicron variant of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to circulate globally. In our multiplex respiratory pathogen detection, we identified numerous instances of co-infection with Echovirus (ECHO) among Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, which exacerbated the clinical symptoms of these patients. Such co-infections are likely to impact the subsequent medical treatment. To date, there are no reports on the pathogenic mechanisms related to COVID-19 co-infected with ECHO. Therefore, this study employed the TM Widely-Targeted metabolomics approach to analyze the serum metabolomes of COVID-19 patients with single SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), COVID-19 patients co-infected with ECHO (COVID-19  +  ECHO), and healthy individuals (Control) recruited from routine physical examinations during the same period. Concurrent clinical laboratory tests were performed on the patients to reveal the differences in metabolomic characteristics between the COVID-19 patients and the COVID-19  +  ECHO patients, as well as to explore potential metabolic pathways that may exacerbate disease progression. Our findings indicate that both clinical examination indicators and the pathways enriched by differential metabolites confirm that patients with dual infection exhibit higher inflammatory and immune responses compared to those with single COVID-19 infections. This difference is likely reflected through abnormalities in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, with the metabolite Sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine playing a crucial role in this process. Finally, we established a diagnostic model based on logistic regression using five differential metabolites, which accurately differentiates between the dual infection population and the single COVID-19 infection population (AUC = 0.828).">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a key contributor to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, driven by factors such as viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and peripheral inflammation. However, the mechanisms linking peripheral inflammation or viral infections to neuroinflammation remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective therapies. Proinflammatory cytokines are implicated in these processes but their effects on brain cells, including microglia, remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we demonstrate that IL-21, a proinflammatory cytokine elevated in autoimmune disorders, chronic viral infections, and Alzheimer’s disease, activates microglia and promotes lipid accumulation within these cells. Young, healthy mice injected with IL-21 to mimic chronic exposure exhibited increased proinflammatory cytokine levels and microglial activation in the brain. Notably, microglia in these mice displayed enhanced lipid accumulation, accompanied by upregulation of lipid uptake receptors such as CD36 and TREM-2. These findings were corroborated using the human microglial cell line HMC-3, where IL-21 exposure similarly induced lipid accumulation and increased expression of CD36 and ApoE. Mechanistic investigations revealed that IL-21 upregulates HIF-1α, a transcription factor critical for lipid metabolism and lipid droplet formation. Additionally, we observed elevated IL-21 levels in the circulation of elderly individuals compared to younger counterparts, with IL-21 increases associated with CMV seropositivity. Aged mouse brains mirrored the microglial lipid accumulation and activation patterns seen in IL-21-injected mice. In summary, we identify a novel IL-21-driven mechanism involving lipid accumulation in microglia that contributes to neuroinflammation.

        <tr id="Molecular changes underlying the persistent health effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. To discern the gene regulatory landscape in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, we performed enzymatic DNA methylome and single-cell RNA sequencing in nasal cells of COVID-19 patients (n = 19, scRNA-seq n = 14) and controls (n = 14, scRNA-seq n = 10). In addition, we resampled a subset of these patients for transcriptome analyses at 3 (n = 7) and 12 months (n = 5) post infection and followed the expression of differentially regulated genes over time. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 3112 differentially methylated regions between COVID-19 patients and controls. Hypomethylated regions affected immune regulatory genes, while hypermethylated regions were associated with genes governing ciliary function. These genes were not only downregulated in the acute phase of the disease but sustained repressed up to 12 months post infection in ciliated cells. Validation in an independent cohort collected 6 months post infection (n  = 15) indicated symptom-dependent transcriptional repression of ciliary genes. We therefore propose that hypermethylation observed in the acute phase may exert a long-term effect on gene expression, possibly contributing to post-acute COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT After the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, the postacute effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection have gradually attracted attention. To precisely evaluate the health status of convalescent patients with COVID‐19, we analyzed symptom and proteome data of 442 plasma samples from healthy controls, hospitalized patients, and convalescent patients 6 or 12 months after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Symptoms analysis revealed distinct relationships in convalescent patients. Results of plasma protein expression levels showed that C1QA, C1QB, C2, CFH, CFHR1, and F10, which regulate the complement system and coagulation, remained highly expressed even at the 12‐month follow‐up compared with their levels in healthy individuals. By combining symptom and proteome data, 442 plasma samples were categorized into three subtypes: S1 (metabolism‐healthy), S2 (COVID‐19 retention), and S3 (long COVID). We speculated that convalescent patients reporting hair loss could have a better health status than those experiencing headaches and dyspnea. Compared to other convalescent patients, those reporting sleep disorders, appetite decrease, and muscle weakness may need more attention because they were classified into the S2 subtype, which had the most samples from hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. Subtyping convalescent patients with COVID‐19 may enable personalized treatments tailored to individual needs. This study provides valuable plasma proteomic datasets for further studies associated with long COVID.">

However, their development is challenging, as no standardized in vitro methodologies that can fully replicate the in vivo environment have been established. In this work, we aimed to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect of three 2-deoxylated glucose analogues (2-DGA): 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2-fluoro-2-dexoy-D-glucose and 2-fluoro-2-dexoy-D-mannose (2-FDM), by utilizing advanced in vitro air-liquid interface (ALI) airway models. We demonstrated that commonly used ALI models have variable susceptibility to RV, IAV and HCoV infection. Further, we showed that 2-DGA have an anti-inflammatory effect and suppress respiratory viral replication in models mimicking the upper and lower respiratory airways. Moreover, we confirmed that 2-DGA can be delivered via nebulization in vitro, highlighting their potential to be used as broad-spectrum inhaled antivirals. Finally, our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating complex in vitro methodologies, such as primary cell ALI cultures and aerosol exposure, at an early stage of drug development.">

        <tr id="Identifying immune markers driving early and effective antibody response in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical due to the threat of future coronavirus pandemics, incomplete global vaccination, and suboptimal booster coverage. Patients with life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are characterized by dysregulated thromboinflammation and cytokine storm that could influence the isotype virus-specific antibody response and the subsequent clinical outcome. We investigated the association between COVID-19-related mortality with the dynamics, magnitude, and relative avidity of nucleoprotein (N), spike (S), and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM, IgA, and IgG in circulation. We also assessed the relationship between the virus-specific antibody responses and cytokine patterns, as well as systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation markers. This multicenter study included COVID-19 patients hospitalized early in the pandemic, classified as survivors (n=62) and non-survivors (n=17). We developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to evaluate each virus-specific isotype using well-characterized outpatient COVID-19 (n=180) and pre-pandemic cohorts (n=111). The pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as the regulatory IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNFRI) levels were evaluated. The ELISAs performed highly for all virus-specific isotypes, although modest for IgM-N. Non-survivors increased N-specific, but no S-specific, IgM and IgA responses throughout the disease course and, more notably, a delayed class switching to IgG-S and IgG-RBD compared to survivors. No differences were observed in the virus-specific IgG relative avidity. Survivors exhibited an antibody response proportional to the degree of systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation, whereas non-survivors showed those dissociated because of their uncontrolled severe thromboinflammation. Only the survivors showed a dominant regulatory cytokine pattern in the early phase of infection (<10 days after symptoms onset), which strongly correlated with developing IgG-S and IgG-RBD protective antibodies. We developed easy-to-use immune assays that enable patient monitoring and identify at-risk populations in low- to middle-income regions. Non-survivors displayed an ineffective N-mediated antibody response, marked by an inability to control inflammation and a compromised time-dependent class switching toward S and RBD-specific IgG. The regulatory cytokine axis, including TGF-β1, maybe a critical immune correlate of effective antibody-mediated immunity in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with ACE2, a key receptor within the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis, regulating blood pressure, and modulating inflammation. An observational study analyzed the gene expression profiles of RAAS receptors and associated miRNAs in 88 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 20 healthy controls, comparing the acute and post-acute phases to assess their impact on disease severity and recovery. Our findings revealed an association between reduced MAS1 expression in both advanced age (P = 0.03) and the need for oxygen supplementation (P = 0.04). Additionally, reduced ACE expression was associated with worse mortality outcomes (P = 0.01). Notably, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) in individuals requiring oxygen supplementation and in those with diabetes mellitus during both the acute and post-COVID-19 phases, further highlighting the impact of these conditions on RAAS. The miRNA analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-200c (P = 0.005), miR-let-7 (P = 0.01), and miR-122 (P = 0.03) in acute-phase COVID-19 patients. This dysregulation contributes to the inflammatory response and highlights the interaction between viral entry and immune regulation. These results underscore the significance of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MAS1 axis in inflammation regulation and suggest that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic potential. Our study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and identifies the modulation of RAAS receptors and miRNAs as promising biomarkers for disease severity and potential therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG = anti-N IgG > anti-S1 IgG > anti-S1A IgG > anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM > anti-S1 IgM > anti-N IgM > anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65 years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Processes related to how the intracranial microvasculature initiates brain‒peripheral crosstalk for subsequent blood‒brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction at an early stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) ictus are still unknown. This study elucidated the effect and potential mechanism of intracranial microvasculature-mediated T-cell infiltration on BBB function after SAH. Methods Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data related to SAH (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/omix; Accession No. OMIX006611) were retrieved and analyzed. The dataset was derived from the white matter region of adult male C57BL/6J mice at 1 and 7 days after experimental SAH. The SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation, and experiments were subsequently conducted at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after SAH to evaluate T-cell infiltration, BBB integrity, neuronal injury, and neurological function. Results After SAH, CXCL12 expression was increased in endothelial cells and pericytes, promoting CD8+ T-cell infiltration via the CXCR4 pathway. This immune infiltration appeared to exacerbate BBB disruption and contribute to worsened neurological function. Blocking CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling with a CXCL12 neutralizing antibody or the CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100 significantly reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration, attenuated BBB damage and improved the neurobehavioral outcomes of SAH mice. Conclusion This study suggests that, following SAH, both pericytes and endothelial cells may contribute to immune regulation by producing CXCL12, which promotes CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration into the brain. This mechanism may play a role in BBB disruption and neurological dysfunction. Targeting the CXCL12–CXCR4 axis could offer a potential approach for mitigating immune-mediated injury after SAH.

        <tr id="Abstract Patients with hematologic diseases have experienced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a prolonged, progressive course. Here, we present clinical, pathological, and virological analyses of three cases of prolonged COVID-19 among patients undergoing treatment for B-cell lymphoma. These patients had all been treated with anti-CD20 antibody and bendamustine. Despite various antiviral treatments, high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) levels persisted for >4 weeks, and two of them succumbed to COVID-19. The autopsy showed bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrosis. Overlapping cytomegalovirus, fungal and/or bacterial infections were also confirmed. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed accumulation of mutations and changes in variant allele frequencies over time. NSP12 mutations V792I and M794I appeared independently in two cases as COVID-19 progressed. In vitro drug susceptibility analysis and an animal experiment using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that each mutation, V792 and M794I, was independently responsible for remdesivir resistance and attenuated pathogenicity. E340A, E340D, and F342INS mutations in the spike protein were found in one case, which may account for the sotrovimab resistance. Analysis of autopsy specimens indicated heterogeneous distribution of these mutations. In summary, we demonstrated temporal and spatial diversity in SARS-CoV-2 that evolved resistance to various antiviral agents in malignant lymphoma patients under immunodeficient conditions caused by certain types of immunochemotherapies. Strategies may be necessary to prevent the acquisition of drug resistance and improve outcomes, such as the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for lymphoma considering patients’ immune status and the institution of early intensive antiviral therapy.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the emergence of viral variants with distinct characteristics. Understanding the differential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for effective public health response and treatment development. We investigated the differential effects of the original Wuhan strain and the emergent Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 using a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between the variants, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality rates, severe lung pathology, and elevated viral loads compared to the Omicron variant. Microbiome analyses uncovered novel and distinct shifts in the lung and intestinal microbiota associated with each variant, providing evidence for variant-specific microbiome alterations. These changes suggest microbiome-related mechanisms that might modulate disease severity and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions This study highlights critical differences between the Wuhan strain and Omicron variant in terms of mortality, lung pathology, and microbiota changes, emphasizing the role of the microbiome in influencing disease outcomes. Novel findings include the identification of variant-specific microbiota shifts, which underscore potential microbiome-related mechanisms underlying differences in disease severity. These insights pave the way for future research exploring microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose significant health threats. As tissue-resident macrophages, alveolar macrophages (AM) are crucial for defending against respiratory viral infection by producing cytokines, engulfing virus-infected cells, and promoting wound healing. However, excessive inflammatory responses can lead to tissue injury. Growing evidence indicates that astragaloside IV (AST IV) regulates innate immune responses. Specifically, AST IV balances the inflammatory response to mitigate tissue damage and promote tissue repair. However, whether AST IV directly targets AM to alleviate lung damage induced by respiratory viral infection remains unclear. Our results demonstrate that AST IV treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in mice during IAV infection. AST IV markedly decreases proinflammatory cytokine levels, mitigates lung injury and promotes lung recovery through enhancing the repair capacity mediated by alveolar type II cells. Mechanistically, AST IV suppresses the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, which is critical for driving inflammatory responses in AM while maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Thus, our findings suggest that AST IV effectively targets AM to alleviate inflammation and lung damage caused by respiratory viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing viral pneumonia.

        <tr id="Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors that enable cells to adapt to low-oxygen environments. Viruses can exploit this pathway to enhance infection, making HIF modulation a potential antiviral strategy. In previous in vitro studies, we found that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) stabilizes HIFs under normoxic conditions with inhibition of HIF-1α reducing replication. Despite several HIF-modulating compounds being tested or approved in other non-infectious models, little is known about their efficacy against respiratory viruses in relevant animal models. This study aimed to characterize the disease-modulating properties and antiviral potential of HIF-1α (PX478) and HIF-2α PT2385 inhibitors in RSV-infected BALB/c mice. We found that the inhibition of HIF-1α worsened clinical disease parameters while simultaneously improving airway function. Blocking HIF-1α also significantly reduced peak RSV replication in the lung. In contrast, the inhibition of HIF-2α was associated with improved clinical parameters, no changes in airway function, and reduced viral replication following RSV infection. The analysis of lung cells found significant modification in the T-cell compartment that correlated with changes in lung pathology and viral titers for each HIF inhibitor. This study underscores the differential roles of HIF proteins in RSV infection and highlights the need for further characterization of compounds currently in use or under therapeutic consideration.">

        <tr id="Introduction Syphilis is a complex disease with variable clinical presentation where symptomatic and potentially infectious stages alternate with periods of latency, representing a fascinating model to study immune evasion and host immune responses. Methods Immunohistochemistry (IHC), bulk, and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin biopsies collected from subjects with secondary syphilis. Additionally, PBMCs from healthy individuals and either primary or MyD88 knock-out keratinocytes were exposed to live Treponema pallidum cells to define initial skin responses to the bacteria. Results Immunohistochemistry of secondary syphilis skin lesions showed a polymorphous immune infiltrate with colocalization of T cells, B cells and antigen–presenting cells. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct cellular contributions to the immune response, with prominent immune-stromal crosstalk accompanied by altered keratinocyte differentiation and decreased intraepidermal communication. Notably, prominent inflammatory signals were countered by concomitant regulatory responses, particularly in infiltrating myeloid cells. Exposure of PBMCs to live T. pallidum inhibited immune responses, while exposure to sonicated cells triggered CXCL1 and CXCL3 upregulation. Keratinocytes responded to both intact and sonicated T. pallidum with upregulation of type-I interferon responses that, however, were abolished in MYD88–deficient but not in STING–deficient keratinocytes. Discussion Our data provide novel insights into the contribution of epidermal TLR sensing through MYD88 to the host response to syphilis infection, highlighting mechanisms by which T. pallidum evades immune responses in skin that may facilitate transmission of this pathogen through the skin.">

        <tr id="Introduction Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to COVID19 disease and caused a worldwide pandemic in 2019. Since the first wave of infections, there has been significant antigenic shifts, leading to the emergence of new variants. Today, infections have shifted away from the severe, fatal infection seen in 2019. Objective This study aimed to assess how the plasma metabolomes from patients varied with infection with different strains and could reflect disease severity. Methods Patients with COVID19 not requiring intensive care were recruited between January 2021 and May 2022 from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; 33 patients with alpha, 13 delta and 14 omicron variants. These were compared to 26 age matched contemporaneously recruited controls. Plasma samples were extracted into chloroform/methanol/water (1:2.5/1 v/v) and assessed by flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Derived data were assessed using the R based MetaboAnalyst platform. Results Plasma metabolomes from COVID19 patients were clearly different from controls. Metabolite variation could be related to infection with different SARS-CoV2 variants. Variant showed different levels of some phospholipids, ganglioside GD1a and a dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative. Correlations of the plasma metabolomes indicated negative correlations between selected phospholipids and the levels of C-reactive protein, creatinine, neutrophil and D-dimer. Conclusion The plasma metabolomes of COVID19 patients show changes, particularly in phospholipids, which could reflect disease severity and SARS-CoV2 variant infection.

        <tr id="Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop mild respiratory symptoms but also Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, severe systemic inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, followed by cleavage by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is known for its immune-modulating effects by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing regulatory T-cells. Furthermore, it has been tested in SARS-CoV-2-related clinical trials. We set out to investigate its role in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Epithelial cells (CaCo-2) were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, treated with native VIP and analyzed to investigate the mRNA and surface expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the enzyme activity of TMPRSS2 and the infection rate by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. VIP downregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and surface expression. Beyond these direct effects, VIP mediates the shedding of surface-expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2 via upregulation of a sheddase protease (ADAM10). Functionally, these dual mechanisms of VIP-mediated downregulation of proteins involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry resulted in a reduced infection rate by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These data imply that VIP hampers viral entry mechanisms based on SARS-CoV-2 and the linkage to ADAM10 may stimulate research in other indications beyond SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Asthma, a chronic airway disease, is marked by allergic inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and tissue remodeling. Influenza infections in asthma patients can cause severe exacerbations, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated how pre-existing allergic inflammation affects immune responses to influenza infection in mice exposed to house dust mite (HDM). Mice were repeatedly exposed to HDM, followed by infection with the influenza A virus, and were sacrificed three days post-infection. Plasma was analyzed for HDM-specific immunoglobulins, while lung tissue was used for immune cell flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analysis. HDM exposure induced allergic inflammation, evidenced by more HDM-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2, eosinophils, neutrophils, Th1, and Th17 cells compared to controls. Upon influenza infection, the effects of HDM and influenza co-infection interacted, showing fewer Th1 cells and regulatory T cells and more Th2 cells compared to mice exposed to the influenza virus alone. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed less upregulation of Th1-related genes and antiviral pathways in co-exposed mice, suggesting impaired Th1 immunity and antiviral responses. Pre-existing allergic inflammation significantly altered immune responses in mice co-infected with influenza, revealing underdeveloped antiviral responses as early as three days post-infection. These findings may explain the increased susceptibility of patients with asthma to severe viral diseases.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Hypervirulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) has emerged as a significant poultry pathogen since 2015, exhibiting clinical multi-organ and multi-tissue tropism post-infection, resulting in substantial economic losses in the poultry industry. However, the molecular mechanism underlying kidney injury caused by FAdV-4 infection remains unclear. Our results indicated that FAdV-4 infection in chickens induces damage to kidney tissues, characterized by the degeneration and necrosis of kidney epithelial cells, glomerular injury, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the activation of a robust inflammatory response in the kidney cells. Notably, autophagosome-like vesicles enclosed clusters of viral particles that were transmitted between kidney cells post-infection. There might be a novel mechanism of vesicle-mediated cell-to-cell transmission of hypervirulent FAdV-4 that hijacks autophagosome-like vesicles. We also investigated cellular autophagy in kidney cells in vivo and in vitro during early FAdV-4 infection. The autophagy-related marker proteins LC3B, ATG5, and BECN1 were upregulated post-infection, whereas SQSTM1 was downregulated, indicating that FAdV-4 infection enhances autophagic flux and induces complete autophagy. The viral structural protein Fiber 2 was also observed to colocalize with the autophagy-related marker protein LC3B and the exosome-specific marker protein CD63 in the kidney cells at 24 hpi, suggesting that FAdV-4-induced cellular autophagy promotes viral replication in kidney cells and that autophagosome-like vesicles are involved in early FAdV-4 replication in vivo in chickens. Our results offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of hypervirulent FAdV-4 from the perspective of kidney injury post-infection. IMPORTANCE Hypervirulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) has become globally prevalent since 2015 as a predominant pathogen on poultry farms, leading to substantial economic losses for the poultry industry. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying kidney injury induced by FAdV-4 infection remain unclear. In this study, we primarily elucidated the mechanisms of kidney injury induced by FAdV-4 infection in chickens, utilizing both in vitro and in vivo models. Our results demonstrate that FAdV-4 infection in chickens causes degeneration and necrosis of kidney epithelial cells, glomerular injury, and expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum, while also triggering a robust inflammatory response in kidney cells. Notably, we observed the cell-to-cell transmission of virus particles delivered by autophagosome-like vesicles, and the viral infection-induced cellular autophagy facilitated viral replication in the kidney cells. These findings offer a novel perspective to understand the molecular mechanisms of FAdV-4-induced kidney injury and establish a basis for further investigation into the molecular pathogenesis of hypervirulent FAdV-4.">

        <tr id="Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) may trigger excessive inflammatory responses, leading to severe viral pneumonia and accelerating disease progression. Therefore, controlling these excessive inflammatory responses is crucial for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia caused by IAV. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, possesses extensive pharmacological activities. However, its immunoregulatory effects and molecular mechanisms in the context of IAV infection require further investigation. This study explored the impact of BBR on macrophage pyroptosis and inflammatory responses induced by IAV infection. Our findings revealed that BBR effectively inhibits the release of IL-1β and TNF-α induced by IAV infection and suppresses gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Further research indicates that BBR alleviates macrophage pyroptosis and inflammatory responses in IAV-infected cells by reducing the release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), inhibiting mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) expression and blocking the activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Experiments using siRNA to knockdown MAVS further confirmed the pivotal role of MAVS in BBR’s inhibition of IAV-induced macrophage pyroptosis. This study provides a scientific basis for the application of BBR as an anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of inflammatory diseases caused by IAV infection and directs future research endeavors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated a global pandemic resulting in an estimated 775 million infections with over 7 million deaths, it has become evident that COVID-19 is not solely a pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has shown that, in a subset of patients, certain symptoms − including chest pain, stroke, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and abdominal pain – all indicate a role of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in the disease process. Many of these disease processes persist long after the acute disease has been resolved, resulting in ‘long COVID’ or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and systemic conditions associated with COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Appropriate animal models provide a method of understanding underlying disease mechanisms at the system level through the study of disease progression, tissue pathology, immune system response to the pathogen and behavioral responses. However, very few studies have addressed PASC and whether existing models hold promise for studying this challenging problem. Here, we review the current literature on cardiovascular, neurological and GI pathobiology caused by COVID-19 in patients, along with established animal models of the acute disease manifestations and their prospects for use in PASC studies. Our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of appropriate models in order to recapitulate certain aspects of the disease to enhance the translatability of mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Aim COVID‐19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) as a pandemic infectious disease. So far, it has been known that this virus uses several receptors to enter the host cell, one of which is neuropilin‐1 (NRP1). Also, one of the main causes of clinical manifestations, severity of disease, and mortality of patients is cytokine storm syndrome, one of these cytokines being interleukin (IL)‐6. Our aim was to study the level of expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Materials and Methods Our study population included the test group (80 patients with COVID‐19) and the control group (30 healthy individuals). Venous blood was taken from all subjects. After isolating PBMCs from blood using Ficoll, RNA was extracted. Then, cDNA synthesis, the expression level of NRP1 and IL‐6 compared to GAPDH housekeeping gene was measured by real‐time PCR. Results The level of NRP1 gene expression was increased significantly in COVID‐19 different groups compared to the control group. Surprisingly, it was observed that the amount of NRP1 gene decreased in the vaccinated group compared to nonvaccinated groups. IL‐6 gene expression was also significantly increased in all groups except vaccinated patients compared to the control group. Also, the results indicated that there was a positive and statistically considerable relationship between IL‐6 expression level and NRP1 expression level (p = 0.03). Conclusion The significant increase in the expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients, especially in moderate and severe cases, indicates their potential involvement in the progression of the disease, which may serve as biomarkers of disease severity. Also, since these genes play an important role in causing severe inflammation, cytokine storm, and immunopathological complications of COVID‐19, further investigations maybe needed to achieve therapeutic goals to control COVID‐19 and similar diseases.">

        <tr id="A select group of pathogens infect neurons in the brain. Prior dogma held that neurons were “defenseless” against infecting microbes, but many studies suggest that neurons can mount anti-microbial defenses. However, a knowledge gap in understanding how neurons respond in vitro and in vivo to different classes of micro-organisms remains. To address this gap, we compared a transcriptional dataset derived from primary neuron cultures (PNCs) infected with the neurotropic intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii with a dataset derived from neurons injected with T. gondii protein in vivo. These curated responses were then compared to the transcriptional responses of PNCs infected with the single stranded RNA viruses West Nile Virus (WNV) or Zika Virus (ZKV). These analyses highlighted a conserved response to infection associated with chemokines (Cxcl10, Ccl2) and cytokines (interferon signaling). However, T. gondii had diminished IFN-α signaling in vitro compared to the viral datasets and was uniquely associated with a decrease in neuron-specific genes (Snap25, Slc17a7, Prkcg). These data underscore that neurons participate in infection-induced neuroinflammation and illustrate that neurons possess both pathogen-specific and pathogen-conserved responses. Importance Though neurons are commonly the target of pathogens that infect the CNS, few datasets assess the neuronal response to infection. This paucity of data is likely because neurons are perceived to have diminished immune capabilities. However, to understand the role of neurons in neuroinflammation and their immune capabilities, their responses must be investigated. Here we analyzed publicly accessible, neuron-specific datasets to compare neuron responses to a eukaryotic pathogen versus two Orthoflaviviruses. A better understanding of neuron responses to different infections will allow us to develop methods for inhibiting pathways that lead to neuron dysfunction, enhancing those that limit pathogen survival, and mitigating infection-induced damage to the CNS.">

        <tr id="The SAR-CoV-2 virus has evolved to co-exist with human hosts, albeit at a substantial energetic cost resulting in post-infection neurological manifestations [Neuro-post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)] that significantly impact public health and economic productivity on a global scale. One of the main molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of Neuro-PASC, in individuals of all ages, is the formation and inadequate proteolysis/clearance of phase-separated amyloid crystalline aggregates—a hallmark feature of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. Amyloidogenesis during viral infection and persistence is a natural, inevitable, protective defense response that is exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2. Acting as chemical catalyst, SARS-CoV-2 accelerates hydrophobic collapse and the heterogeneous nucleation of amorphous amyloids into stable β-sheet aggregates. The clearance of amyloid aggregates is most effective during slow wave sleep, when high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—a biphasic modulator of biomolecular condensates—and melatonin are available to solubilize amyloid aggregates for removal. The dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics by SARS-CoV-2, in particular fusion and fission homeostasis, impairs the proper formation of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations that can remedy challenges created by the diversion of substrates away from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis to support viral replication and maintenance. The subsequent reduction of ATP and inhibition of melatonin synthesis during slow wave sleep results in incomplete brain clearance of amyloid aggregates, leading to the development of neurological manifestations commonly associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Exogenous melatonin not only prevents mitochondrial dysfunction but also elevates ATP production, effectively augmenting the solubilizing effect of the adenosine moiety to ensure the timely, optimal disaggregation and clearance of pathogenic amyloid aggregates in the prevention and attenuation of Neuro-PASC.">

        <tr id="Although the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the emergence of the post-COVID-19 condition presents a new and complex public health challenge, characterized by persistent, multisystem symptoms that can endure for weeks or months after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, significantly affecting survivors’ quality of life. Among the most concerning sequelae are cardiovascular complications, which encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial damage, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This narrative review explores the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health by reviewing the latest and most relevant findings in the literature and highlighting different aspects of COVID-19’s cardiovascular involvement. This review investigates the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular involvement in the post-COVID-19 condition, with a focus on direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, immune-mediated cardiovascular injury, cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial injury. The interplay between pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19 is also explored, revealing that individuals with such conditions are at heightened risk for both severe acute illness and long-term complications. Long-term immune activation and the persistence of viral antigens are increasingly recognized as contributors to ongoing cardiovascular damage, even in individuals with mild or asymptomatic initial infections. As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a deeper understanding of these cardiovascular manifestations is essential. This knowledge will inform the development of targeted strategies for prevention, clinical management, and rehabilitation of affected patients. Furthermore, the insights gained from the intersection of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping responses to future viral epidemics, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches to patient care and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Early antibody therapy can prevent severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). However, the effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy in treating severe COVID-19 remains inconclusive. To test a hypothesis that some CCP units are associated with a coagulopathy hazard in severe disease that offsets its benefits, we tracked 304 CCP units administered to 414 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to assess their association with the onset of unfavorable post-transfusion D-dimer trends. CCP recipients with increasing or persistently elevated D-dimer trajectories after transfusion experienced higher mortality than those whose D-dimer levels were persistently low or decreasing after transfusion. Within the CCP donor-recipient network, recipients with increasing or persistently high D-dimer trajectories were skewed toward association with a minority of CCP units. In in vitro assays, CCP from “higher-risk” units had higher cross-reactivity with the spike protein of human seasonal betacoronavirus OC43. “Higher-risk” CCP units also mediated greater Fcγ receptor IIa signaling against cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike compared with “lower-risk” units. This study finds that post-transfusion activation of coagulation pathways during severe COVID-19 is associated with specific CCP antibody profiles and supports a potential mechanism of immune complex–activated coagulopathy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Following successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, those survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) often suffer from severe brain injury, and the latter can result in significant mortality and morbidity. Emerging evidence implicates that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of post‐resuscitation brain injury, and its regulatory mechanisms remain to be investigated. Recently, some studies manifested that long noncoding RNAs could be critical regulators of cell ferroptosis in diverse ischemia–reperfusion injuries of vital organs. This study was designed to explore the role and mechanism of a newly screened long noncoding RNA ENSSSCG00000035331 in alleviating post‐resuscitation hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and further investigate its potential regulation by a novel antioxidant sulforaphane. Methods and Results Healthy male pigs and mice were used to establish the models of CA and resuscitation in vivo. A hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model using primary porcine hippocampal neurons was constructed to replicate post‐resuscitation brain injury in vitro. We found that the expression of ENSSSCG00000035331 was significantly decreased in the post‐resuscitation impaired hippocampus using RNA sequencing analysis and verification. Subsequently, ENSSSCG00000035331 overexpression significantly reduced ferroptosis‐related ferrous iron and reactive oxygen species production while markedly increased glutathione and further alleviated post‐resuscitation brain injury. Mechanistically, ENSSSCG00000035331 interacted with miR‐let7a, then inhibited its binding with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA and finally promoted the recovery of the latter's translation after H/R stimulation. In addition, sulforaphane treatment significantly increased ENSSSCG00000035331 and GPX4 expression while markedly decreased miR‐let7a expression and hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and finally alleviated post‐resuscitation brain injury. Conclusions Our findings highlighted that ENSSSCG00000035331 was a critical regulator of hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis after CA and resuscitation by targeting the miR‐let7a/GPX4 axis, and additionally, sulforaphane might be a promising therapeutic agent for alleviating post‐resuscitation brain injury by regulating the signaling axis mentioned above.">

        <tr id="Approximately four months after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, around 25% of individuals developed visuoconstructive deficit (VCD), which was found to be correlated with an increase in peripheral immune markers and alterations in structural and metabolic brain imaging. Recently, it has been demonstrated that supplemental vitamin B12 regulates hyperinflammation during moderate and severe COVID-19 through methyl-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, whole peripheral blood cultures were produced using samples obtained from patients with confirmed persistent VCD, and controls without impairment, between 10 and 16 months after mild COVID-19. This experimental model was used to assess the leukocyte expression patterns of 11 biomarkers previously associated with VCD in long COVID and explore the potential of pharmacological B12 in regulating these genes. The results showed that patients with persistent VCD displayed continued upregulation of CCL11 and LIF compared to controls. It is worth noting that elevated serum levels of CCL11 have been previously linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the addition of 1 nM of vitamin B12 to blood cultures from individuals with VCD normalized the mRNA levels of CCL11, upregulated the neuroprotective HGF, and, to a lesser extent, downregulated CSF2 and CXCL10. There was an inverse correlation observed between CCL11 mRNA levels and methylation levels of specific cytosines in its promoter region. These findings underscore the significance of systemic inflammation in persistent VCD associated with long COVID. Moreover, the study provides evidence suggesting that B12, acting as an epidrug, shows promise as a therapeutic approach for addressing this cognitive impairment.

        <tr id="Background Defining the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is critical for informing the management of reinfections, vaccinations, and therapeutics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Using four antibody assays, we evaluated antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and receptor binding domain (RBD) in 98 convalescent participants with varying COVID-19 disease severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe) at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months post-SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR and in 17 non-vaccinated, non-infected controls. Results Increasing acute COVID-19 disease severity correlates with higher anti-N and anti-RBD titers throughout 12 months post-infection. Anti-N and anti-RBD titers decline over time in all participants, except for increased anti-RBD titers post-vaccination, with hospitalized participants exhibiting faster decay rates. Less than 50% of participants retain anti-N titers above controls at 12 months, with non-hospitalized participants falling below controls sooner. Nearly all participants maintain anti-RBD titers above controls for 12 months, suggesting long-term protection against severe reinfections. Nonetheless, by 6 months, few participants retain >50% of their initial 1-month anti-N or anti-RBD titers. Notably, vaccine-induced anti-RBD titers are higher in non-hospitalized participants. Lastly, early convalescent titers correlate with age but not with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) status or steroid use. Conclusion Hospitalized participants initially develop higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that decline faster relative to non-hospitalized participants. While anti-N titers fall below control levels in some participants, anti-RBD titers remain above controls over 12 months, demonstrating long-lived antibody responses known to protect against severe disease. These findings advance our understanding of COVID-19 antibody dynamics.">

        <tr id="Introduction SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) share similarities in their modes of transmission, pathophysiological symptoms, and clinical manifestations. An imbalance in the immune response characterised by elevated levels of some inflammatory cytokines caused by tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 may increase the risk of developing a severe disease-like condition. It has been reported that TB increases the expression levels of Ace2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) and Tmprss2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) proteins, which are essential for COVID-19 pathogenesis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) variants of ace2 and tmprss2 genes can impact virus and host-cell interactions and alter immune responses by modulating cytokine production. This may modify the susceptibility and/or severity in COVID-19-infected people. The role of SNPs in ace2 and tmprss2 in relation to Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection is relatively underexplored. Method In this study, genotype frequency of 10 SNPs of ace2 and 03 SNPs of tmprss2 genes in a Cameroonian cohort consisting of COVID-19-positive (n = 31), TB-positive (n = 43), TB-COVID-19 co-infected (n = 21), and a control group (n = 24) were studied. The immune response was estimated by quantitating inflammatory cytokine levels alongside self-reported and clinically diagnosed symptoms. The relationship between specific genetic mutations in these ace2 gene SNPs and their impact on cytokine expression levels in Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients was investigated. Results We identified wild-type, heterozygous, and double-mutant genotypes in seven SNPs (rs2285666, rs6632677, rs4646116, rs4646140, rs147311723, rs2074192 and rs4646142) in ace2 gene, which showed significant variations in distribution across the study groups. Our most significant findings include the association of double mutant alleles (AA) of rs4646140 and rs2074192 in the ace2 gene with decreased IL-6 and IL-2 expression levels respectively in TB-COVID-19 participants. Also, the double mutant alleles (AA) of rs4646116 were responsible for increased expression level of IL-2 in TB-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, elevated serum levels of AST, urea, and D-dimer, as well as increased plasma concentrations of IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, have been associated with co-infections involving Mtb and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion These biomarkers may reflect the complex interplay between the two pathogens and their impact on host immune responses and disease progression. This study highlights the critical role of genetic and immunological factors in shaping altered immune responses during co-infections involving Mtb and SARS-CoV-2. By elucidating these factors, the findings provide a foundation for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and their implications for disease progression and outcomes. Furthermore, this research has the potential to drive advancements in diagnostic approaches enabling more accurate detection and monitoring of co-infections.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) pathology involves complex immune responses within granulomatous lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cellular compositions of necrotizing granulomatous lesions that developed in the lungs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We identified 11 distinct major cell types, including phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, and T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among T cells, particularly, Pdcd1⁺ γδ T cells were detected in necrotizing granulomatous lesions, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Within the macrophage populations, we identified a cluster with significantly higher Plin2 expression compared to other clusters, whose transcriptomic profile was consistent with that of foamy macrophages. A subset of the Plin2-expressing macrophages was identified as a major source of Ifnb1 and Cxcl1, suggesting their involvement in type I interferon signaling and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, we identified Flrt2, Hyal1, and Mmp13 as novel molecular markers of Plin2-expressing macrophages, which were localized to the peripheral rim regions of necrotizing granulomas. In conclusion, our results provide the immune landscape of necrotizing granulomas and reveal novel functional states of macrophages contributing to TB pathogenesis.">

Clustering analysis using the K-prototypes method identified underlying biological patterns in patients with COVID-19. The penalized multinomial logistic regression analysis identified two comorbidities (hypertension, congestive heart failure) and thirteen analytes as potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression with 88.2% accuracy. Based on a patient’s age, high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and pentraxin 3 were important biomarkers for lethal COVID-19. Decreased concentrations of interferon gamma-induced protein-10, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I were found to be associated with mild COVID-19, while increasing concentrations of these analytes could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: An overwhelming burden to clinics, herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is a painful disease that occurs frequently among aged individuals with a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection history. The cause of shingles is the reactivation of dormant VZV in the dorsal root ganglia/cranial nerves of the human body. Patients with HZ experience sharp, intense, electric shock-like pain, which makes their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) extremely low. Methods: Various mRNA constructs were designed based on intracellular organelle-targeting strategies and AI algorithm-guided high-throughput automation platform screening and were then synthesized by in vitro transcription and encapsulated with four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Immunogenicity was evaluated on a naïve mouse model, long-term mouse model, and VZV-primed mouse model. Safety was evaluated by a modified “nestlet shredding” method for potential adverse effects induced by vaccines. Comparison between muscular and intradermal administrations was conducted using different inoculated approaches as well. Results: The best vaccine candidate, CVG206, showed robust humoral and cellular immune responses, durable immune protection, and the fewest adverse effects. The CVG206 administered intradermally revealed at least threefold higher humoral and cellular immune responses compared to intramuscular vaccination. The manufactured and lyophilized patch of CVG206 demonstrated good thermal stability at 2–8 °C during 9 months of storage. Conclusions: The lyophilized mRNA vaccine CVG206 possesses remarkable immunogenicity, long-term protection, safety, and thermal stability, and its effectiveness could even be further improved by intradermal administration, revealing that CVG206 is a promising vaccine candidate for HZ in future clinical studies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the virus’s unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish it from other respiratory pathogens. It is known that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) activates a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell survival, contributing to the wide range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of HIF-1α is a key driver of systemic inflammation, silent hypoxia, and pathological tissue remodeling in both the acute and post-acute phases of the disease. This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in INPLASY. It involved a literature search in Scopus and PubMed, supplemented by manual reference screening, with study selection facilitated by Rayyan software. Our analysis clarifies the dual role of HIF-1α, which may either worsen inflammatory responses and viral persistence or support adaptive mechanisms that reduce cellular damage. The potential for targeting HIF-1α therapeutically in COVID-19 is complex, requiring further investigation to clarify its precise role and translational applications. This review deepens the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue dysfunction in hypoxia, offering insights for improving clinical management strategies and addressing long-term sequelae.">

 Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ended, the enduring health impacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continue to garner global attention, as approximately 10% of patients develop long COVID (post COVID-19 condition). The epidemiological characteristics and symptoms of long COVID have been reported, and various pathogenic hypotheses have been proposed. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or fragments persist in some patients post-infection and that these are correlated with long COVID symptoms. This review focuses on clinical studies linking SARS-CoV-2 persistence to long COVID symptoms, and explores the relationship between viral persistence and other etiological hypotheses, such as immune dysregulation, vascular issues, coagulation dysfunction, microbiome dysbiosis, brainstem/vagus nerve signaling dysfunction, and latent virus reactivation. Futhermore, treatment strategies for long COVID are proposed based on current clinical trials of antiviral and immune modulation therapies. Understanding the role of viral persistence in long COVID pathogenesis is critical for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical management of this debilitating condition.

While previous evidences were obtained in mouse models, this study represents the first comprehensive assessment of FLAMOD delivered by nebulization in pigs. Our results demonstrate that a single nebulization of FLAMOD did not cause any adverse effects on clinical parameters. Histological analysis supported that FLAMOD treatment led to immune cell infiltration in the lung tissue, indicative of an active immune response. Flow cytometry confirmed granulocyte recruitment in conducting airways. RNA sequencing established immune activation across the respiratory tract, from the nose, trachea, bronchi to the lungs, highlighting innate immunity, bacterial defense, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and granulocyte chemotaxis as key biological pathways. These findings demonstrated the capacity of FLAMOD to induce a robust and common immune response throughout the porcine respiratory system as well as specific compartmentalized immune signatures. This study establishes FLAMOD as a potent activator of innate immunity, providing a proof-of-concept for inhalation-based therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial pneumonia in the clinical setting.">

        <tr id="Background SARS-CoV-2 infection has been responsible of COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemia and can cause a variety of symptoms including gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain and liver injury. The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is expressed in gut and SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce vascular damage and immune system dysregulation, creating an inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, as widely described at the lung level. Case presentation This work presents the case of a middle-aged Caucasian man admitted to the Hospital Emergency Department from the University Hospital of Ferrara (Italy), complaining of pain in the upper and middle region of the abdomen. The patient tested negative to the nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 four weeks after recovering from viral infection. The patient required resection of a segment of ileum and an ulcer of the bowel wall was recognized and sampled. Previous published results had confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, an increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) and an altered morphology of microvilli in the ulcerated ileum of the patient when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum. The present study sought to deepen the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, we evaluated the expression and co-expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Fibronectin by immunohistochemical techniques. VEGF immunohistochemical expression was higher in the ulcer than in the control ileum sample and the non-ulcerated ileum areas and co-expressed with the SPIKE protein. Fibronectin staining was lower in control sample than in non-ulcerated and ulcerated ileum. Electron microscopy analysis showed alterations of the integrity of the intestinal barrier in the ulcerated area when compared to the non-ulcerated ileum or to the control sample. Conclusions Although the patient was tested negative to nose-oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, the SPIKE protein was detected in his terminal ileum, especially in the ulcerated areas. The presence of the viral protein was also associated with an increase of VEGF and Fibronectin. In addition to vascular changes, the SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the junctional apparatus among epithelial cells, making the tissue even more fragile and thus susceptible to the entry of pathogens and the development of further infections.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 is characterized by the persistence of symptoms and immune alterations beyond the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the demographic, clinical, and immunological differences between individuals with and without long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This observational study included 206 participants, comprising 90 patients with long COVID-19 and 116 without. Data on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were collected, alongside immune cell profiles and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Statistical analyses compared these parameters between the two groups. Long COVID-19 patients were predominantly female (77.8%), older (47.78% aged 41–60, 20% >60 years), and had higher BMI, hypertension (31.1%), and autoimmune diseases (11.1%) compared to nonlong COVID-19 individuals (P < 0.001). Clinical symptoms unique to long COVID-19 included memory loss (40.0%), hair loss (37.8%), fatigue (35.6%), and myalgia/arthralgia (28.9%), all absent in the control group (P < 0.001). Immunologically, patients with long COVID-19 exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), reduced B cells, and higher CD4/CD8 ratios. Moreover, long COVID-19 patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, with 15.5% showing levels between 1000–2500 BAU/ml, compared to 6.9% in controls. These immunological biomarkers, including altered T cell subsets and antibody levels, highlight the complex immune dysregulation associated with long COVID-19. These findings could inform future clinical management and therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Understanding factors that predict progression to severe COVID-19 is critical. Antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein confer protection, while the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays roles in viral replication and immune dysfunction. This study explores the significance of N protein and anti-spike antibodies on disease severity, progression, and mortality. Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 N protein and anti-spike antibody levels with disease severity, clinical outcomes, and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Design: A secondary analysis of serologic data from participants in the ACTIV-1 randomized clinical trial, which evaluated immunomodulators for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A subanalysis of the ACTIV-1 immune modulator trial was conducted. Samples collected at randomization were tested for N protein levels and anti-spike antibodies. Logistic regression and linear models were employed to examine the association between serological measures and clinical outcomes, including 28-day mortality as well as progression to high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Results: Among the 496 participants with detectable serum N protein, the median was 1143 ng/dL, and levels decreased from 2559 ng/dL in participants randomized at 6 days of symptom onset to 477.6 ng/dL at 11 days. Higher anti-spike antibody levels were seen as the days from symptom onset progressed or disease severity increased. Greater disease severity at randomization was associated with 28-day mortality, prolonged days of oxygenation, ventilation, hospitalization, and risk of new non-invasive ventilation, HFNC, MV, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use. N protein levels were associated with a higher risk of new non-invasive ventilation or HFNC use, longer oxygenation duration, and extended hospitalization. Anti-spike antibody serologies were not associated with clinical outcomes. Conclusion: N protein levels could provide insights into COVID-19 disease progression and prognosis. Further research is needed to explore the clinical implications of these findings to optimize patient care and enhance outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Neuropathological and clinical studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the long-term risk of neurodegeneration. Methods We provide a narrative overview of pathological and clinical observations justifying the implementation of a surveillance program to monitor changes in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the years after COVID-19. Results Autopsy studies revealed diverse changes in the brain, including loss of vascular integrity, microthromboses, gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal- and glial injury and cell death, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals irrespective of the severity of COVID-19. Recent data suggest that microglia play an important role in sustained COVID-19-related inflammation, which contributes to the etiology initiating a neurodegenerative cascade, to the worsening of pre-existing neurodegenerative disease or to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Histopathological data have been supported by neuroimaging, and epidemiological studies also suggested a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases after COVID-19. Conclusions Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic, healthcare systems should be aware of, and be prepared for a potential increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the upcoming years. Strategies may include follow-up of well-described cohorts, analyses of outcomes in COVID-19-registries, nationwide surveillance programs using record-linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses, and comparing the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the post-pandemic periods to values of the pre-pandemic years. Awareness and active surveillance are particularly needed, because diverse clinical manifestations due to earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may no longer be quoted as post-COVID-19 symptoms, and hence, increasing incidence of neurodegenerative pathologies at the community level may remain unnoticed.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus’ ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.">

        <tr id="Background Contributions of leukocytes to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) defense have been reported extensively. However, it remains unclear whether there are different leukocyte responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Methods We analyzed peripheral blood leukocyte and subtype concentrations from 575 COVID-19 patients and 950 non-COVID-19 subjects registered at the University of Connecticut John Dempsey Hospital between 2020 and 2022, which covers the ancestral strain, Delta, and Omicron variants. Results We found that neutrophils, immature granulocytes, and monocytes were elevated, and lymphocytes were reduced after infection. These hyperactive neutrophils/immature granulocytes and suppressed lymphocytes/monocytes were associated with poorer prognosis in ancestral strain infection. Different from the ancestral strain, hyperactive immature granulocytes were not shown in the decedents of Delta infection, and immature granulocyte concentration was not observed to be associated with mortality. In Omicron infection, suppressed lymphocytes and monocytes were not shown in the decedents, and lymphocyte/monocyte concentrations were not associated with mortality.

        <tr id="The type I interferons (IFNs) are a group of key cytokines of the vertebrate innate immune system that induce an antiviral state in uninfected cells. Experimental in-vitro and in-vivo data have proven the fundamental role these cytokines possess in the protective response to a wide variety of pathogens, including herpesviruses. In a clinical setting, IFNs have been an important treatment in humans for several decades and increasing evidence demonstrates their potential in controlling viral haemorrhagic fevers when administered early in disease. In juvenile Asian elephants, elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus haemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD) often proves fatal when an effective adaptive immune response cannot be mounted in time, suggesting that an enhancement of the innate immune response could provide protection. This study sequenced six members of the Asian elephant type I IFNs, most closely related to sequences from the African elephant and Florida manatee. Subsequently, recombinant Asian elephant IFNα and IFNβ proteins were expressed and assessed for bioactivity in-vitro, relative to recombinant human IFNs, using a novel infection model incorporating primary Asian elephant fibroblasts and bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) as a surrogate for EEHV. In a dose-dependent manner, both Asian elephant IFNs and human IFNα2a protected cells from BoHV-1 infection in this proof-of-concept study, even if applied up to 24 hours post-infection in-vitro.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a devastating autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) with limited treatment options. Several studies have shown attenuation of the well-characterized GBS preclinical experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) model with systemically administered therapeutic compounds via anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory mechanisms. Despite this, clinical advancement of these findings is limited by dosing that is not translatable to humans or is associated with off-target and toxic effects. This is due, in part, to the blood-nerve barrier (BNB), which restricts access of the circulation to peripheral nerves. However, during acute neuroinflammation, the normally restrictive BNB exhibits increased vascular permeability and enables immune cell infiltration. This may offer a unique window to access the otherwise restricted peripheral nerve microenvironment for therapeutic delivery. Here, we assessed the degree to which BNB permeability and immune cell infiltration over the course of EAN enables accumulation of circulating nanoparticles. We found that at disease stages defined by distinct clinical scores and pathology (onset, effector phase, and peak of EAN severity), intravenously administered small molecules and nanoparticles ranging from 50 to 150 nm can permeate into the endoneurium from the endoneurial vasculature in a size- and stage-dependent manner. This permeation occurs uniformly in both sciatic nerves and in proximal and distal regions of the nerves. We propose that this nerve targeting enabled by pathology serves as a platform by which potential therapies for GBS can be reevaluated and investigated preclinically in nanoparticle delivery systems.">

        <tr id="Little is known about the regulation of B cell subpopulations in association with programmed cell death during dengue virus (DENV) infection. Therefore, blood samples from dengue-infected patients and healthy donors were obtained for B cell subset characterization and the analysis of pro-apoptotic CD95 expression in these cell subsets. The results showed that the activated memory (AM) subset in the patients remained unchanged compared to the healthy donors. In contrast, tissue memory (TM) and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were notably increased, whereas naïve cells and resting memory (RM) cells were considerably decreased. Although the ASCs maintained comparably high levels of CD95 expression in both groups, significantly increased percentages of CD95-expressing cells in the other B cell subsets were found in the patients. When B cells from the healthy donors were treated with DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), the results showed that the NS1 protein at 2 µg/mL could induce CD95 expression and the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane in most B cell subsets, except for the RM. This study demonstrates that DENV infection could induce CD95 expression in both activated and resting B cell subsets in all patients. The results also suggest a potential mechanism of apoptotic regulation in B cell subsets through the increased CD95 expression caused by the interaction between the B cells and the NS1 protein.">

        <tr id="Respiratory infections with RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Using a natural rodent pathogen, Sendai virus (SeV), which is similar to RSV, mice made atopic with house dust mite survived a normally lethal SeV infection. One protein that we found markedly elevated in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of atopic mice was neuregulin-1 (NRG1). Administration of NRG1 protected naïve (non-atopic) mice from death with both SeV and mouse adapted influenza A virus (IAV). Survival was associated with reduced alveolar epithelium permeability and reduced phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein indicating inhibition of necroptosis. In vitro, treatment of mouse lung epithelial cells with NRG1 inhibited SeV induced necroptosis, and NRG1 administration to differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells infected with RSV reduced transepithelial fluid leak and expression of necroptosis associated genes RIPK3 and MLKL, while regulating genes associated with homeostatic maintenance, suggesting stabilized epithelial integrity. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a unique function of NRG1 in respiratory viral infections by reducing alveolar leak, inhibiting epithelial necroptosis, and promoting homeostatic regulation of airway epithelium, all of which associate with markedly reduced mortality to the respiratory viral insult.">

        <tr id="Lassa fever is a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. In the absence of efficient prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures, it poses a substantial threat to public health in this region. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the severity of the disease are poorly known because Lassa virus (LASV), its causative agent, has to be handled in BSL-4 laboratories and access to clinical samples is difficult. The control of Lassa fever is associated with a rapid and well-balanced immune response and viral clearance. However, severe disease is characterized by uncontrolled innate immune activation and symptoms reminiscent of sepsis and a cytokine storm. In a model of cynomolgus monkeys infected with two different strains of the virus, one causing moderate disease and the other a lethal outcome, we show that the control of LASV infection is characterized by the induction of a LASV-specific T-cell response, whereas severity is associated with the expansion of suppressive myeloid cells, alterations of the stromal network of secondary lymphoid organs, and the anergy of specific T cells. These results suggest that T cells are crucial for the control of LASV and that immunomodulatory therapeutics, such as checkpoint inhibitors, could contribute to new therapeutic strategies to treat Lassa fever. They also highlight how immunosuppressive mechanisms described in sepsis and cancer patients may play a role in the pathogenicity of Lassa fever, as well as in other similar hemorrhagic fevers.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most patients recover fully after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2. Some, however, may develop pulmonary sequelae (PS) and/or long COVID (LC). However, whether these two clinical conditions have similar or different pathogenic mechanisms is unknown. Methods The levels of autoantibodies and 184 inflammatory and organ damage associated proteins in plasma were determined (by immunofluorescence and Olink panels, respectively) 1 year after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 51 patients with PS (DLCO < 80% ref), 31 patients with LC and 31 patients fully recovered (Rec). PS was defined by the presence of reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) lower than 80% ref. LC was defined by the presence of chronic symptoms in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Results We found that patients with PS or LC both showed increased levels than Rec of anti-microbial, immune cell activation and recruitment related proteins. Patients with PS showed higher levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies, whereas LC patients had increased levels of organ-damage associated proteins. In patients with PS most of the elevated proteins correlate with the impairment of lung function (DLCO). Finally, in PS we additionally performed the determinations at an earlier time point (6 months) and showed that the expression of CCL20 and IFN-ɣ was already higher at 6 months, while CCL3 and CCL19 increase from 6 to 12 months, suggesting a pathogenic role in PS persistence. Conclusions Patients with PS or LC have abnormal but different persistent circulatory immune and organ damage biomarkers, suggesting different underlying biology of both post-COVID conditions.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns. Studies focused on post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and DNAm have been mainly carried out among severe COVID-19 cases or without distinguishing the severity of cases. However, investigations into mild and asymptomatic cases after SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited. In this study, we analyzed DNAm patterns of mild and asymptomatic cases seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a household setting by conducting epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Results We identified DNAm changes at 42 CpG sites associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. We additionally report EWAS between COVID-19 cases and controls, with the case status being confirmed by either an antibody test or a PCR test. The EWAS with an antibody test case definition identified 172 CpG sites to be differentially methylated, while the EWAS with a PCR test case definition identified 502 CpG sites. Two common sites, namely cg17126990 (annotated to AFAP1L2) and cg25483596 (annotated to PC), were identified to be hypermethylated across the three EWAS. Both CpG sites have been reported to be involved in molecular pathways after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While AFAP1L2 has been found to be upregulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pyruvate carboxylase (PC) activity seems to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in changes to the host cell metabolism. Additionally, an EWAS to assess persistent health restrictions among PCR-confirmed cases showed 40 CpG sites to be differentially methylated. Conclusions We detected associations between DNAm in individuals who had asymptomatic and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections as compared to their household controls. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed months after infection.

        <tr id="Background: Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aims to evaluate immune system markers, including antigen-specific antibodies, B cell subsets, and Th2-related cytokines, in individuals with long COVID and to investigate their potential impact on the development of this condition. Methods: We analyzed blood plasma from 63 individuals diagnosed with long COVID based on clinical presentation and 47 healthy individuals with COVID-19 history but no clinical symptoms. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies were measured using commercial ELISA kits. Lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed via flow cytometry and a gating strategy based on CD27 and CD38. Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) were quantified using the xMAP multiplex assay. Results: We noted no significant differences in IgG levels between groups. Notably, individuals with long COVID demonstrated a higher percentage of naive mature B cells (CD27−CD38+), while transitional (CD27−CD38+++) and double-negative (DN, CD27−CD38-) cells were significantly reduced. Elevated levels of IL-5 and IL-13 were observed in long COVID patients. Classification analysis revealed that the percentage of transitional B cells (CD27−CD38+++) was a strong predictor of long COVID. Conclusions: Our findings highlight alterations in B cell dynamics among individuals with long COVID, which may contribute to autoimmune processes.">

        <tr id="Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that utilizes its type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to inject virulence factors into host cells and colonize the host. In turn, a subset of cytosolic immune receptors respond to T3SS ligands by forming multimeric signaling complexes called inflammasomes, which activate caspases that induce interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokine release and an inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis. Human macrophages mount a multifaceted inflammasome response to Salmonella infection that ultimately restricts intracellular bacterial replication. However, how inflammasomes restrict Salmonella replication remains unknown. We find that caspase-1 is essential for mediating inflammasome responses to Salmonella and restricting bacterial replication within human macrophages, with caspase-4 contributing as well. We also demonstrate that the downstream pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) and Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1), a mediator of terminal cell lysis, play a role in controlling Salmonella replication in human macrophages. Notably, in the absence of inflammasome responses, we observed hyperreplication of Salmonella within the cytosol of infected cells as well as increased bacterial replication within vacuoles, suggesting that inflammasomes control Salmonella replication primarily within the cytosol and also within vacuoles. These findings reveal that inflammatory caspases and pyroptotic factors mediate inflammasome responses that restrict the subcellular localization of intracellular Salmonella replication within human macrophages.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia globally and is characterised by reduced mitochondrial respiration and cortical deposition of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyper-phosphorylated tau. Despite its characterisation more than 110 years ago, the mechanisms by which AD develops are still unclear. Dysregulation of microglial phagocytosis of amyloid-β may play a key role. Microglia are the major innate immune cell of the central nervous system and are critical responders to pro-inflammatory states. Typically, microglia react with a short-lived inflammatory response. However, a dysregulation in the resolution of this microglial response results in the chronic release of inflammatory mediators. This prolongs the state of neuroinflammation, likely contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, the microglial specialised pro-resolving mediator (SPM) contribution to phagocytosis of amyloid-β is dysregulated in AD. SPMs are derivatives of dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and potentially represent a strategic target for protection against AD progression. However, there is little understanding of how mitochondrial respiration in microglia may be sustained long term by n-3-derived SPMs, and how this affects their clearance of amyloid-β. Here, we re-evaluate the current literature on SPMs in AD and propose that SPMs may improve phagocytosis of amyloid-β by microglia as a result of sustained mitochondrial respiration and allowing a pro-resolution response.">

        <tr id="Introduction Severe COVID-19 is characterized by hyperimmune host responses contributing to airway damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Type III interferons (IFN), including IFN lambda 4 (IFNλ4), expressed in individuals harboring the rs368234815-ΔG allele, are implicated in host immune responses to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Methods We investigated associations between IFNλ4 expression through genotyping and COVID-19 disease severity in 853 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases enrolled in the All-Ireland Infectious Diseases Cohort. Additionally, we measured plasma levels of Type I, II and III IFN using quantitative immunoassays along with IFNλ4 expression and COVID-19 disease severity in a sub-group [n=321 (37.6%)] with samples available within 10 days of symptom onset. IFNλ4 was expressed in 382 (44.8%) but expression was not significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Results Within the sub-group, we found no consistent associations between IFNλ4 expression and circulating IFNs. However, we observed significantly increased expression of IFNλ1 and IFNλ2 in severe COVID-19 (P<0.01), with IFNλ2 remaining significantly associated after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, including obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) (P<0.001). Interestingly, although IFNλ2 levels were significantly higher in subjects with obesity, the association between higher IFNλ2 and COVID-19 disease severity was only observed in individuals without obesity (P<0.01). Conclusion These data reveal an important role for IFNλ2 as an immune correlate that predicts COVID-19 disease severity, which may be masked in those with obesity.">

        <tr id="Background Acute lung injury (ALI), including its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a common cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Although its clinical characteristics have been well characterized, the relevant mechanism remains unclear. An imbalance in autophagy leads to alveolar remodeling and triggers the pathogenesis of ARDS. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine (Fluda) in ALI. C57BL6 mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their lung tissues were analyzed via next-generation transcriptome sequencing. Results Western blotting revealed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was highly expressed and STAT1 was phosphorylated following LPS exposure. Fluda significantly decreased the protein expression of STAT1/IRF1 and inhibited the alveolar infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. Nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release was decreased in the lungs of mice and RAW264.7 macrophages following Fluda treatment. In LPS-induced GFP-LC3 transgenic mice treated with Fluda, the counts of LC3-expressing neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid were significantly decreased. Furthermore, Fluda decreased LC3 and p62 protein expression, thereby inhibiting the release of NO, IL-6, and TNF-α in BAL. In RAW264.7 cells, the inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda decreased LPS-induced ERK and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Conclusions The inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda plays a pivotal role in modulating dysregulated autophagy by suppressing the MAPK and NF-κB p65 pathways in ALI.

        <tr id="γδ T cells are a unique subset of unconventional T cells and an important component of the innate immune system. Unlike conventional αβ T cells, γδ T cells can respond rapidly during the early stages of infection, and their antigen recognition is not restricted by MHC molecules. These distinctive features underscore the important role of γδ T cells in viral clearance and infection control. Therefore, γδ T cell-based immunotherapies have been extensively explored for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Several therapeutic strategies based on γδ T cells have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising safety and efficacy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for flavivirus infections, which are typically characterized by acute onset. Research has shown that γδ T cells can rapidly expand during the early phases of flavivirus infections and effectively suppress viral replication, making them an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for flavivirus infections. This review aims to highlight the immunological roles of γδ T cells in flavivirus infections and to explore the potential of γδ T cell-based therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging coronavirus causing economic losses to swine industries worldwide. PDCoV can infect chickens under laboratory conditions, usually with no symptoms or mild symptoms, and may cause outbreaks in backyard poultry and wildfowl, posing a potential risk of significant economic loss to the commercial poultry industry. However, the reasons for such a subdued reaction after infection are not known. Here, using chicken intestinal organoid monolayers, we found that although PDCoV infects them nearly as well as porcine intestinal organoid monolayers, infection did not result in detectable amounts of progeny virus. In ex vivo and in vivo experiments using chickens, PDCoV infection failed to initiate interferon and inflammatory responses. Additionally, infection did not result in a disrupted intestinal barrier nor a reduced number of goblet cells and mucus secretion, as in pigs. In fact, the number of goblet cells increased as did the secreted mucus, thereby providing an enhanced protective barrier. Ex vivo PDCoV infection in chicken triggered activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway with the upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway genes (Wnt3a, Lrp5, β-catenin, and TCF4) and Wnt target genes (Lgr5, cyclin D1, and C-myc). This activation stimulates the self-renewal of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), accelerating ISC-mediated epithelial regeneration by significant up-regulation of PCNA (transiently amplifying cells), BMI1 (ISCs), and Lyz (Paneth cells). Our data demonstrate that abortive infection of PDCoV in chicken cells activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which facilitates the self-renewal and proliferation of ISCs, contributing to chickens’ resistance to PDCoV infection. IMPORTANCE The intestinal epithelium is the main target of PDCoV infection and serves as a physical barrier against pathogens. Additionally, ISCs are charged with tissue repair after injury, and promoting rapid self-renewal of intestinal epithelium will help to re-establish the physical barrier and maintain intestinal health. We found that PDCoV infection in chicken intestinal organoid monolayers resulted in abortive infection and failed to produce infectious virions, disrupt the intestinal barrier, reduce the number of goblet cells and mucus secretion, and induce innate immunity, but rather increased goblet cell numbers and mucus secretion. Abortive PDCoV infection activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, enhancing ISC renewal and accelerating the renewal and replenishment of shed PDCoV-infected intestinal epithelial cells, thereby enhancing chicken resistance to PDCoV infection. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the mild or asymptomatic response to PDCoV infection in chickens, which is critical for understanding the virus’s potential risks to the poultry industry.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence indicate that individual host immune response to pathogens may be as important as virulence factors in determining the severity of infection. However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology®™ software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NFκ-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response. Author Summery Infections often cause personal suffering, but also high economic costs. Brain infections such as bacterial or viral meningitis are particularly serious and carry a high risk of death or permanent disability. At the same time, resistance to anti-infective drugs is increasing and fewer new antibiotics are being developed. As a result, there is a great need for translational research to develop new treatments beyond conventional anti-infectives. Due to its strict compartmentalisation, the brain is well suited to identify specific pathogen-dependent, but also host (patient) dependent inflammatory patterns in infections. Using a cohort of patients with a defined group of pathogen-specific meningitis, we investigated the inflammatory patterns in the cerebrospinal fluid and were able to describe new specific pathogen-dependent and new host-dependent immune responses and identify associated signalling pathways. We were also able to show how and at what cellular and molecular level the blood-brain barrier is disrupted by infection. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier is an important aspect and has major implications for the course and prognosis of brain infections. Once the pathogen- and host-specific aspects of the immune response are understood, new personalised therapeutic approaches can be developed that directly target the regulation of the individual immune response.">

        <tr id="Immunocompromised patients are disproportionately impacted by severe disease, hospitalization, and mortality associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To optimize the management of these patients in clinical practice, we convened an expert panel to review current evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine responses and severe COVID-19 in immunocompromised populations. We identified four main immunocompromised groups—solid organ transplant recipients, patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, patients treated for hematologic malignancies, and patients treated for inflammatory diseases—who mount suboptimal humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and are at increased risk of severe COVID-19-related outcomes. A wide range of risk factors were associated with reduced vaccine responses and/or poor outcomes, most commonly older age, comorbidities, and the type and number of immunosuppressive therapies. We believe that early identification and close monitoring of these at-risk patients, plus regular booster vaccinations, prophylactic monoclonal antibody therapy, non-pharmacologic prevention measures, prompt antiviral treatment, and other risk mitigation strategies, are critical to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="Severe infections such as malaria are on the rise worldwide, driven by both climate change and increasing drug resistance. It is therefore paramount that we better understand how the host responds to severe infection. Hematopoiesis is particularly of interest in this context because hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the turnover of all blood cells, including all immune cells. Severe infections have been widely acknowledged to affect HSPCs; however, this disruption has been mainly studied during the acute phase, and the process and level of HSPC recovery remain understudied. Using a self-resolving model of natural rodent malaria, infection by Plasmodium chabaudi, here we systematically assess phenotypically defined HSPCs’ acute response and recovery upon pathogen clearance. We demonstrate that during the acute phase of infection the most quiescent and functional stem cells are depleted, multipotent progenitor compartments are drastically enlarged, and oligopotent progenitors virtually disappear, underpinned by dramatic, population-specific and sometimes unexpected changes in proliferation rates. HSPC populations return to homeostatic size and proliferation rate again through specific patterns of recovery. Overall, our data demonstrate that HSPC populations adopt different responses to cope with severe infection and suggest that the ability to adjust proliferative capacity becomes more restricted as differentiation progresses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective To elucidate crucial immune cell subsets and associated immunological pathways by stratifying patients with immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) using immunophenotyping and transcriptomic approaches. Methods We conducted flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses in 23 immune cell subsets derived from 235 patients with six IMDs, using our database, utilizing our database, ImmuNexUT. Patients were stratified based on immunophenotyping data. Subsequently, we examined clinical and transcriptomic differences among these stratified clusters. Results Patients with IMDs were stratified into two clusters based on their immunophenotypes. Cluster 1 was enriched with differentiated B cells, including unswitched memory B cells (USM B), switched memory B cells, double-negative B cells and plasmablasts, while cluster 2 was enriched with naïve B cells. Higher disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and decreased respiratory functions in systemic sclerosis were observed in cluster 1, whereas the disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus was higher in cluster 2. Numerous differentially expressed genes were detected in USM B. Cluster 1 was associated with glycosylation processes in USM B and elevated B cell-activating factor signalling from myeloid cells in B cells, while cluster 2 exhibited higher B-cell receptor signalling in USM B. Patients in cluster 2, which had an elevated age-associated B-cell signature, exhibited more frequent flares, suggesting that an increased proportion of naïve B cells with this signature is associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion Immunophenotyping-based clusters and transcriptome-based states revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in B cells. To predict IMD prognosis, assessing both the quantity and quality of naïve B cells may be crucial.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 is characterized by immune dysregulation and coagulation abnormalities, leading to complications such as thromboembolism and multi-organ failure. This study explores the relationship between autoantibodies targeting coagulation-related factors and gene expression in severe COVID-19. Whole-blood transcriptomics revealed upregulation of coagulation-related genes, including VWF and Factor V, in severe patients compared to mild cases and healthy controls. Autoantibody profiling against seven coagulation-related proteins (ADAMTS13, Factor V, Protein S, SERPINC1, Apo-H, PROC1, and Prothrombin) showed reactivities below established positivity thresholds, but mean-fluorescent intensities were elevated numerically in severe (Protein S) and convalescent (SERPINC1) patients. Correlation analysis revealed trends of negative associations between autoantibody reactivities and coagulation gene expression in severe cases, suggesting a potential role for autoantibodies in modulating immune-coagulation interactions warranting further orthogonal validation. Furthermore, age-dependent increases in subthreshold autoantibody reactivities were observed in severe cases, highlighting the potential impact of immunosenescence on disease severity. These findings do not exclude the possibility that subthreshold autoantibodies may contribute indirectly to immune-coagulation dynamics in severe COVID-19 through mechanisms beyond direct transcriptional regulation. This study highlights the complexity of immune-coagulation interactions and provides foundation for future research into their biological and clinical relevance, particularly for identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets in thromboinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="The soluble variant of the ectopeptidase CD13 (sCD13), released from the cell surface by matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), is a potent pro-inflammatory mediator, displaying chemotactic, angiogenic, and arthritogenic properties through bradykinin receptor B1 (B1R). We reveal a link between sCD13 and amplified neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. sCD13 was markedly elevated in COVID-19 patients and correlated with disease severity, variants, ethnicity, inflammation markers, and NETosis. Neutrophils treated with sCD13 showed heightened NETosis and chemotaxis which were inhibited by sCD13 receptor blockade. Meanwhile sCD13 did not induce platelet aggregation. Single-cell analysis of COVID-19 lungs revealed co-expression of CD13 and MMP14 by various cell types, and higher CD13 expression compared to controls. Neutrophils with high CD13 mRNA were enriched for genes associated with immaturity, though CD13 protein expression was lower. Histological examination of COVID-19 lungs revealed CD13-positive leukocytes trapped in vessels with fibrin thrombi. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of B1R and a second sCD13 receptor, protease-activated receptor 4, on monocytes and neutrophils. These findings identify sCD13 as a potential instigator of COVID-19-associated NETosis, potentiating vascular stress and thromboembolic complications. The potent pro-inflammatory effects of sCD13 may contribute to severe COVID-19, suggesting that sCD13 and its receptors might be therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="The outcome of COVID-19 disease is strongly related to the interaction between the virus and the host immune response, which may become dysregulated in critically ill patients. This dysregulated response is characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory mediators, an overactivation of the innate immune system, 1 lymphopenia, 2 delayed antibody and interferon responses, 3 and a massive dissemination of viral components into the blood, 4 all of which contribute to severity and increased mortality. 5–7 These immune and non-immune parameters can be integrated into so-called combitypes 8 to identify subgroups of patients with different immune profiles and outcomes, helping to guide clinical strategies. In a previous study we used viral RNA levels in plasma to categorize a multicentre cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients into three subgroups with different mortality rate. 4 In this study, we combined virological data (SARS-CoV-2 N1 RNA plasma load and N-antigenemia) and 32 host response biomarkers to improve classification of critically ill COVID-19 patients, with the objective to identify biological clues explaining survival. We conducted a prospective cohort study in 785 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a plasma EDTA sample collected at intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health challenge. Severe cases often respond poorly to standard treatments, highlighting the necessity for novel therapeutic targets and early predictive biomarkers.We utilized flow cytometry to analyze peripheral immune cells from healthy, bacterial pneumonia patients, and COVID-19 patients. The expansion of activated T cells (CD38+HLA-DR+), monocytes, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were detected and correlated with clinical outcomes to evaluate prognostic potential. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to characterize the critical cell subset associated with prognosis and elucidate its phenotype in COVID-19.We revealed a significant increase in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells in non-survivor COVID-19 patients, establishing them as an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality. The scRNA-seq analysis identified the CD38+HLA-DR+ T cell as a terminally differentiated, Treg-like subset exhibiting both activation and exhaustion characteristics. This subset presented the highest IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels among all T-cell subsets. Further functional analysis demonstrated its enhanced major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) cross-signaling and correspondingly enriched cytoskeletal rearrangement processes. In addition, there was dysregulated NAD+ metabolism in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells via scRNA-seq, accompanied by elevated adenosine and decreased NAD+ levels in serums from COVID-19 patients.We identified the selective expansion of CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells as a novel prognostic indicator for COVID-19 outcomes. These cells’ unique activated-exhausted phenotype, along with their impact on NAD+ metabolism, provides new insights into COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The immune response to virus infection in the respiratory tract must be carefully balanced to achieve pathogen clearance without excessive immunopathology. For chronic respiratory diseases where there is ongoing inflammation, such as in asthma and COPD, airway immune balance is perturbed, and viral infection frequently worsens (exacerbates) these conditions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical to the induction and propagation of inflammation, and when appropriately regulated, ROS are vital cell signalling molecules and contribute to innate immunity. However, extended periods of high ROS concentration can cause excessive cellular damage that dysregulates antiviral immunity and promotes inflammation. Traditional antioxidant therapeutics have had limited success treating inflammatory diseases such as viral exacerbations of asthma or COPD, owing to nonspecific pharmacology and poorly understood pharmacokinetic properties. These drawbacks could be addressed with novel drug delivery technologies and pharmacological agents. This review summarises current research on ROS imbalances during virus infection, discusses the commercially available mitochondrial antioxidant drugs that have progressed to clinical trial and assesses novel drug delivery approaches for antioxidant delivery to the airways. Additionally, it provides a perspective on future research into pharmacological targeting of ROS for the treatment of respiratory virus infection and disease.">

        <tr id="After peripheral infections, the initial accumulation of prions within secondary lymphoid tissues is essential for the transmission of disease to the brain. Macrophages are considered to sequester or destroy prions, but little was known of their impact on disease susceptibility after a peripheral infection. Inflammation in the peritoneal cavity can trigger the macrophage disappearance reaction, whereby the macrophages are temporarily contained within cellular aggregates on the mesothelium. We studied the impact of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated macrophage disappearance reaction on susceptibility to an intraperitoneal prion infection. Intraperitoneal LPS injection significantly enhanced prion disease susceptibility approximately 100X when given 24–3 h before infection. The effects on disease susceptibility coincided with the reduced abundance of macrophages within the peritoneal cavity at the time of infection and the enhanced early accumulation of prions in the spleen. This suggests that the reduced recoverable abundance of macrophages in the peritoneal cavity following acute LPS-treatment, increased disease susceptibility by enhancing the initial propagation of the prions from site of exposure (peritoneal cavity) to the spleen from where they subsequently spread to the brain. Further studies may help identify novel macrophage-targeted treatments that can reduce susceptibility to peripherally acquired prion infections.">

        <tr id="The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in late 2019 initiated a global health crisis marked by widespread infection, significant mortality, and long-term health implications. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, recent findings indicate that it also significantly disrupts the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, contributing to disease severity, systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections and chronic conditions. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, exacerbates the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and has been linked to long-COVID, a condition affecting a significant proportion of survivors and manifesting with over 200 symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the growing recognition of microbiome alterations in COVID-19, the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the microbiome and influences disease progression remain poorly understood. This narrative review investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-microbiota dynamics and evaluates its implications in disease severity and for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Furthermore, it highlights the dual role of the microbiome in modulating disease progression, and as a promising target for advancing diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches in managing COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) encompasses a heterogeneous group of lysosomal storage diseases resulting from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes responsible for the degradation of mucopolysaccharides, also known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Current therapeutic strategies for MPS include hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), and symptomatic therapy. This study investigated dynamic changes in MPS type II (MPS-II) through genomic and single-cell sequencing in a patient undergoing ERT. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from one MPS-II patient of 10 year old at different disease stages through scRNA-seq identified various immune cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, NKT cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, CD14 + and CD16 + monocytes, and B cells. Monocytes and macrophages were significantly reduced during the severe stage of MPS-II but increased during the recovery stage following ERT. Notably, monocyte subtype mono3 was exclusively expressed in the severe stage, while mono1_2, a subtype of mono1, was absent during the severe stage and exhibited distinct biological functions. These findings suggest that monocytes and macrophages play critical roles in the pathogenesis of MPS-II and in the response to ERT. Pseudotime, Gene Ontology, and cell-communication analyses revealed unique functions for the different cellular subtypes. Notably, key molecules mediating cellular interactions during ERT in MPS-II included CXCR3, PF4, APP, and C5AR1 in macrophages, RPS19 in T cells, HLA-DPB1 in B cells, ADRB2 in NK cells, and IL1B, C5AR1, RPS19, and TNFSF13B in monocytes. Overall, integrative analysis delineated the expression dynamics of various cell types and identified mutations in MPS-II, providing a comprehensive atlas of transcriptional programs, cellular characterizations, and genomic variation profiles in MPS-II. This dataset, along with advanced integrative analysis, represents a valuable resource for the discovery of drug targets and the improvement of therapeutic strategies for MPS-II.

        <tr id="Dengue is an important tropical disease with considerable global impact. Despite this, there remains an urgent need for reliable biomarkers to predict disease severity, as well as effective antiviral drugs and targeted treatments. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of 41 plasma mediators in patients with asymptomatic dengue (AD) and symptomatic dengue (SD), which includes mild dengue fever (DF) and severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Our findings revealed that the levels of nearly all measured mediators were consistently lower in AD compared to SD patients, suggesting a potential protective cytokine response signature. Time-course cytokine analysis in SD shown significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammation and viral clearance upon the acute phase, while various growth factors were elevated during the convalescence. Notably, we identified elevated IL-15 levels in DHF patients three days before fever subsidence, highlighting its potential as an early prognostic biomarker for severe disease outcomes. Furthermore, prolonged high levels of IL-8 and IP-10 in DHF during the critical period may contribute to dengue immunopathogenesis. This study advances the understanding of cytokine dynamics in the natural course of human dengue infection, providing valuable insights for the development of targeted treatments and prognostic biomarkers.

        <tr id="Data of low-density neutrophils (LDN), the neutrophils in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) fraction, in sepsis is still less. As such, LDN (CD66b-positive cells in PBMC) was highest in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis (n=24) compared with non-sepsis (n=10) and healthy control (n=20), with a negative correlation with lymphocyte count and could predict secondary infection and mortality with the area under the curve (AUC) at 0.79 and 0.84, respectively. Compared with sepsis normal-density neutrophils (NDN), sepsis-LDN demonstrated higher expression of CD66b, CD63, CD11b, and CD184, but lower expression of CD62L and CD182 and defects of effector functions, including phagocytosis and apoptosis. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNEs) demonstrated high program cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in sepsis-LDN. In sepsis samples, the T cell proliferation in PBMC (T cells with LDNs) was lower than that in the isolated T cells (T cells alone) and incubation of anti-PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, but not a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger (N-acetyl cysteine), improved the T cell suppression. Additionally, 30 min lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation altered healthy control NDN into LPS-LDN (reduced density) and LPS-NDN (maintain density) with similarly elevated CD66b, CD11B, and CD62L. However, LPS-LDN (in vitro LDN) showed lower expression of CD63, CD184, and PD-L1 compared with LDN from patients (sepsis-LDN), suggesting a partial LPS impact on LDN generation. From the microscopic-based method (Wright’s staining in PBMC), sepsis-LDN demonstrated a mixed population of mature and immature cells with a good correlation with the flow-based analysis (Bland–Altman analysis and AUC). In conclusion, LDN in sepsis, partly generated by LPS activation, was associated with secondary infection and T cell suppression, mainly through the expression of PD-L1, which might be an immune suppression biomarker, especially with a less expensive microscopic-based method.">

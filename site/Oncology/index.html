        <tr id="Introduction Over the past four years, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious global health challenges. The severe form of disease and death resulted from the failure of immune regulatory mechanisms, closely highlighted by the dual proinflammatory cytokine and soluble immune checkpoint (sICP) storm. Identifying the individual factors impacting on disease severity, evolution and outcome, as well as any additional interconnections, have become of high scientific interest. Methods In this study, we evaluated a novel panel composed of ten sICPs for the predictive values of COVID-19 disease severity, mortality and Delta vs. Omicron variant infections in relation to hyperinflammatory biomarkers. The serum levels of sICPs from confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital admission were determined by Luminex, and artificial neural network analysis was applied for defining the distinct patterns of molecular associations with each form of disease: mild, moderate, and severe. Results Notably, distinct sICP profiles characterized various stages of disease and Delta infections: while sCD40 played a central role in all defined diagrams, the differences emerged from the distribution levels of four molecules recently found and relatively less investigated (sCD30, s4-1BB, sTIM-1, sB7-H3), and their associations with various hematological and biochemical inflammatory biomarkers. The artificial neural network analysis revealed the prominent role of serum sTIM-1 and Galectin-9 levels at hospital admission in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors, as well as the role of specific anti-interleukin therapy (Tocilizumab, Anakinra) in improving survival for patients with initially high sTIM-1 levels. Furthermore, strong associations between sCD40 and Galectin-9 with suPAR defined the Omicron variant infections, while the positive match of sCD40 with sTREM-1 serum levels characterized the Delta-infected patients. Conclusions Of importance, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulatory immune factors governing the COVID-19 pathology, and identifies key roles of sCD40, sTIM-1, and Galectin-9 in predicting mortality.">

        <tr id="Tissue-specific immune responses are critical determinants of health-maintaining homeostasis and disease-related dysbiosis. In the context of COVID-19, oral immune responses reflect local host-pathogen dynamics near the site of infection and serve as important "windows to the body," reflecting systemic responses to the invading SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study leveraged multiplex technology to characterize the salivary SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological landscape (37 cytokines/chemokines and 11 antibodies) during early infection. Cytokine/immune profiling was performed on unstimulated cleared whole saliva collected from 227 adult SARS-CoV-2+ participants and 37 controls. Statistical analysis and modeling revealed significant differential abundance of 25 cytokines (16 downregulated, 9 upregulated). Pathway analysis demonstrated early SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with local suppression of oral type I/III interferon and blunted natural killer-/T-cell responses, reflecting a potential novel immune-evasion strategy enabling infection. This virus-associated immune suppression occurred concomitantly with significant upregulation of proinflammatory pathways including marked increases in the acute phase proteins pentraxin-3 and chitinase-3-like-1. Irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior vaccination was associated with increased total α-SARS-CoV-2-spike (trimer), -S1 protein, -RBD, and -nucleocapsid salivary antibodies, highlighting the importance of COVID-19 vaccination in eliciting mucosal responses. Altogether, our findings highlight saliva as a stable and accessible biofluid for monitoring host responses to SARS-CoV-2 over time and suggest that oral-mucosal immune dysregulation is a hallmark of early SARS-CoV-2 infection, with possible implications for viral evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, iron toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) are widely held to drive tissue damage, yet the specific roles of central nervous system (CNS)- resident versus CNS-invading MPs remain unclear. Here, by combining single-cell profiling with conditional gene targeting, we systematically dissected and interfered with ROS production across CNS MPs in a preclinical model for neuroinflammation. We show that CNS-invading monocyte derived cells (MdCs) exhibit a higher oxidative stress gene signature and produce more ROS compared to CNS-resident microglia. While NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a phagocytic source of ROS, proved redundant, our findings underscore the critical role of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in driving oxidative tissue damage. Quenching mtROS through mitocatalase overexpression in MdCs, but not microglia, significantly alleviated neuroinflammation in mice. Thus, our study resolves a longstanding controversy, identifying MdCs as the primary driver of ROS-mediated neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory immune response. Monocytes and macrophages play a central role in this hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been observed in monocytes of patients with COVID-19, but the mechanism and consequences of inflammasome activation require further investigation. In this study, we inoculated a macrophage-like THP-1 cell line, primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, and primary monocytes with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages does not rely on viral replication, receptor-mediated entry, or actin-dependent entry. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected hNEC cultures without triggering the production of inflammasome cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β. Importantly, these cytokines did not inhibit viral replication in hNEC cultures. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of primary monocytes led to inflammasome activation and induced a macrophage phenotype in these cells. Monocytic cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, but not from peripheral blood, of patients with COVID-19, showed evidence of inflammasome activation, expressed the proinflammatory marker CD11b, and displayed oxidative burst. These findings highlight the central role of activated macrophages, as a result of direct viral sensing, in COVID-19 and support the inhibition of IL-1β and IL-18 as potential therapeutic strategies to reduce immunopathology without increasing viral replication. IMPORTANCE Inflammasome activation is associated with severe COVID-19. The impact of inflammasome activation on viral replication and mechanistic details of this activation are not clarified. This study advances our understanding of the role of inflammasome activation in macrophages by identifying TLR2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 as dependent factors in this activation. Further, it highlights that SARS-CoV-2 inflammasome activation is not a feature of nasal epithelial cells but rather activation of bystander macrophages in the airway. Finally, we demonstrate that two pro inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammasome activation, IL-18 and IL-1β, do not restrict viral replication and are potential targets to ameliorate pathological inflammation in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neurological complications, including encephalopathy and stroke, occur in a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases but viral protein is seldom detected in the brain parenchyma. To model this situation, we developed a novel low-inoculum K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection during which active viral replication was consistently seen in mouse lungs but not in the brain. We found that several mediators previously associated with encephalopathy in clinical samples were upregulated in the lung, including CCL2, and IL-6. In addition, several inflammatory mediations, including CCL4, IFNγ, IL-17A, were upregulated in the brain, associated with microglial reactivity. Parallel in vitro experiments demonstrated that the filtered supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 virion exposed brain endothelial cells induced activation of uninfected microglia. This model successfully recreates SARS-CoV-2 virus-associated para-infectious brain inflammation which can be used to study the pathophysiology of the neurological complications and the identification of potential immune targets for treatment.">

        <tr id="The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a devastating impact. Although many survived the acute effects of the pandemic, a significant number of survivors, including those with only mild symptoms, are now experiencing a prolonged and debilitating post-viral syndrome known as LC/PASC (long COVID/post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2). Typical symptoms of LC/PASC include fatigue, breathlessness, chest pain, impaired cognition, difficulty sleeping, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Anxiety and depression can also last for weeks to months and range from mild to disabling. The association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection raises questions about the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry to the central nervous system (CNS) and long-term effects of the virus on the CNS, their molecular basis, and the potential risk of neuronal damage associated with the subsequent development of neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include myocardial injury, heart failure, and myocarditis and are associated with long-term disability and mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and antigens are found in the myocardium of COVID-19 patients, and human cardiomyocytes are susceptible to infection in cell or organoid cultures. While these observations raise the possibility that cardiomyocyte infection may contribute to the cardiac sequelae of COVID-19, a causal relationship between cardiomyocyte infection and myocardial dysfunction and pathology has not been established. Here, we generated a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-restricted infection by selectively expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in cardiomyocytes. Inoculation of Myh6-Cre Rosa26loxP-STOP-loxP-hACE2 mice with an ancestral, non-mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in viral replication within the heart, accumulation of macrophages, and moderate left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Cardiac pathology in this model was transient and resolved with viral clearance. Blockade of monocyte trafficking reduced macrophage accumulation, suppressed the development of LV systolic dysfunction, and promoted viral clearance in the heart. These findings establish a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 cardiomyocyte infection that recapitulates features of cardiac dysfunctions of COVID-19 and suggests that both viral replication and resultant innate immune responses contribute to cardiac pathology.IMPORTANCEHeart involvement after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurs in multiple ways and is associated with worse outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. It remains unclear if cardiac disease is driven by primary infection of the heart or immune response to the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of entering contractile cells of the heart in a culture dish. However, it remains unclear how such infection affects the function of the heart in the body. Here, we designed a mouse in which only heart muscle cells can be infected with a SARS-CoV-2 strain to study cardiac infection in isolation from other organ systems. In our model, infected mice show viral infection, worse function, and accumulation of immune cells in the heart. A subset of immune cells facilitates such worsening heart function. As this model shows features similar to those observed in patients, it may be useful for understanding the heart disease that occurs as a part of COVID-19.">

 The immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are still under investigation. While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is usually mild in the pediatric population, some children develop severe clinical manifestations or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) after infection. MIS-C, typically emerging 2-6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is characterized by a hyperinflammatory response affecting multiple organs. This review aims to explore the complex landscape of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, focusing on innate, T cell-, and B cell-mediated immunity, and discusses the role of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a superantigen in MIS-C pathophysiology. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for improving the management and outcomes for affected children.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is linked to high mortality, primarily through an intense inflammatory response. Diacerein has emerged as a potential therapy for COVID-19 due to its potential impact in decreasing the inflammasome activation and coronavirus replication. This study aims to explore diacerein’s influence in inhibiting both viral replication and the inflammatory response after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy volunteers and infected in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we carried out a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 14 participants allocated to diacerein (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) therapies every 12 h for 10 days. The primary endpoint was change in plasma markers of inflammasome activation (NLRP3, caspase-1, and gasdermin-D).In vitro protocols have shown that rhein, diacerein’s primary metabolite, decreased IL-1β secretion caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in human PBMCs (p < 0.05), and suppressed viral replication when administered either before or after the virus incubation (p < 0.05). This later effect was, at least partially, attributed to its inhibitory effect on 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro) and papain-like protease in the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) virus and in the phosphorylation of proteins related cytoskeleton network (p < 0.05). Diacerein-treated COVID-19 patients presented a smaller area under the curve for NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDM-D measured on days 2, 5, and 10 after hospitalization compared to those receiving a placebo (p < 0.05).The indicated mechanisms of action of diacerein/rhein can reduce viral replication and mitigate the inflammatory response related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings are preliminary and require confirmation in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the impact of viral infections on individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Initial observations suggested lower COVID-19 rates among CF populations; however, subsequent clinical data have presented a more complex scenario. This study aimed to investigate how bronchial epithelial cells from CF and non-CF individuals, including various CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, respond to in vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV. Comparisons with the Influenza A virus (IAV) were included based on evidence that CF patients experience heightened morbidity from IAV infection. Our findings showed that CF epithelial cells exhibited reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of the type of CFTR mutation or SARS-CoV-2 variant, as well as the original 2003 SARS-Cove. In contrast, these cells displayed more efficient IAV replication compared to non-CF cells. Interestingly, the reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in CF was not linked to the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor nor to CFTR dysfunction, as pharmacological treatments to restore CFTR function did not normalize the viral response. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and CFTR function influenced the levels of certain cytokines and chemokines, although these effects were not correlated. Overall, this study reveals a unique viral response in CF epithelial cells, characterized by reduced replication for some viruses like SARS-CoV-2, while showing increased susceptibility to others such as IAV. This research offers a new perspective on CF and viral interactions, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these differences.

Both the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2003 and the MERS-CoV outbreak of 2013 resulted in overall low fatalities in part due to inefficient human-to-human spread of each virus. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in 2019, was highly efficient at human-to-human spread and caused a global pandemic resulting in millions of casualties. Zoonotic transmission of viruses, including the three coronaviruses, poses an ongoing threat that cannot be ignored. In this review, we have focused on the diagnostics and therapeutics fronts using SARS-CoV-2 as a model. Specifically, we have selected proteins associated with the virus particles as targets and discussed various platform technologies.

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is characterized by its high transmissibility, which has caused a worldwide epidemiological event. Yet, it turns ominous once the disease progression degenerates into severe pneumonia and sepsis, presenting a horrendous lethality. To elucidate the alveolar immune or inflammatory landscapes of Omicron critical-ill patients, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the patients with critical pneumonia caused by Omicron infection, and analyzed the correlation between the clinical severity scores and different immune cell subpopulations. In the BALF of Omicron critical patients, the alveolar violent myeloid inflammatory environment was determined. ISG15+ neutrophils and CXCL10+ macrophages, both expressed the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), were negatively correlated with clinical pulmonary infection score, while septic CST7+ neutrophils and inflammatory VCAN+ macrophages were positively correlated with sequential organ failure assessment. The percentages of ISG15+ neutrophils were associated with more protective alveolar epithelial cells, and may reshape CD4+ T cells to the exhaustive phenotype, thus preventing immune injuries. The CXCL10+ macrophages may promote plasmablast/plasma cell survival and activation as well as the production of specific antibodies. As compared to the previous BALF scRNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 wild-type/Alpha critical patients, the subsets of neutrophils and macrophages with pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory features presented obvious distinctions, suggesting an immune disparity in Omicron variants. Overall, this study provides a BALF single-cell atlas of Omicron critical patients, and suggests that alveolar interferon-responsive neutrophils and macrophages may extricate SARS-CoV-2 Omicron critical patients from the nasty fate of sepsis.">

        <tr id="Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) impacts multiple anatomical sites. Whether this is due to the virus itself or is a secondary effect caused by the influx and activation of immune cells is not known. Positron emission tomography (PET) with immunoglobulins can provide insights into which sites and cells are activated in a living animal. Our aim is to use two nanobodies as tools to monitor (1) the distribution of antigen presenting cells (APC) by virtue of their Mafa-DR expression profile, (2) virus-infected cells and viral particles using a nanobody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Two [89Zr]-labeled nanobodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II antigens (Mafa-DR), respectively, are used to monitor their distribution during an experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in a nonhuman primate model. Scans are obtained before infection and on Day 3 and 10 post infection (pi) in two macaques each. The [89Zr]anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike nanobody localized to SARS-CoV-2-associated lung lesions and the nasal mucosa, while the [89Zr]anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR nanobody was predominantly found in non-affected lung tissue after infection. We also detected, pi, upregulation of the Mafa-DR signal, indicative of recruitment of professional APCs, in the superior sagittal sinus. [89Zr]-labeled nanobodies show recruitment of macrophages/monocytes in non-lesional lung tissue in cynomolgus macaques after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as accumulation of the spike protein in both lung lesions and the nasal mucosa during infection. These results show the possibility of in vivo monitoring the quality and quantity of immune responses during the initial stages of an infection.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has confirmed that the ability to rapidly mutate may be extremely beneficial for a virus. Not long after the first wave, new variants emerged with altered infectivity, disease severity, and mortality. These new strains most notably had numerous mutations of the spike (S) protein, a surface protein responsible for binding to and entering the host cell. The Delta and Omicron strains demonstrated increased immune evasion and improved binding affinity to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study examines the ability of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 IgG to bind Delta and Omicron antigens, as well as their functional binding capabilities to two different S-ACE2 complexes. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from patients who had recovered from infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of COVID-19 and 10 pre-pandemic control samples were studied. SARS-CoV-2 exposed patients showed significantly higher levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD (p < 0.001), N protein (p < 0.001), and Omicron spike variant (p = 0.01), but not to Delta spike variant (p = 0.966) when compared with controls. Furthermore, patient samples showed significantly greater inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 binding (p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Conversely, there was no correlation between the binding inhibition of S1/RBD and E484K spike to ACE2 receptor. This study shows there is considerable cross-reactivity of IgG generated by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection to the Delta and Omicron variants.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infects via the respiratory tract, but COVID-19 includes an array of non-respiratory symptoms, among them gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations such as vomiting and diarrhea. Here we investigated the GI pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in rhesus macaques and humans. Macaques experienced mild infection with USA-WA1/2020 and shed viral RNA in the respiratory tract and stool, including subgenomic RNA indicative of replication in the GI tract. Intestinal immune cell populations were disturbed, with significantly fewer proliferating (Ki67+) jejunal B cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques than uninfected ones. Modest translocation of bacteria/bacterial antigen was observed across the colonic epithelium, with a corresponding significant increase in plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14) that may be induced by LPS. Human plasma demonstrated significant decreases in interleukin (IL)-6 and sCD14 upon recovery from COVID-19, suggesting resolution of inflammation and response to translocated bacteria. sCD14 significantly positively correlated with zonulin, an indicator of gut barrier integrity, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that GI perturbations such as microbial translocation can occur in even mild SARS-CoV-2 infections and may contribute to the COVID-19 inflammatory state.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates gastrointestinal (GI) barrier disruption in SARS-CoV-2 infections and how it may contribute to disease. We observed bacteria or bacterial products crossing from the colon interior (the lumen) to the lamina propria during SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques. Bacteria/bacterial products are tolerated in the lumen but may induce immune responses if they translocate to the lamina propria. We also observed a significant increase in soluble CD14, which is associated with an immune response to bacterial products. In addition, we observed that humans recovering from COVID-19 experienced a significant decrease in soluble CD14, as well as the inflammatory marker interleukin (IL)-6. IL-6 and sCD14 correlated significantly across macaque and human samples. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in GI barrier disruption that permits microbial translocation and a corresponding immune response. These findings could aid in developing interventions to improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by multiorgan involvement and inflammation. Testing of cellular function ex vivo to understand the aberrant immune response in MIS-C is limited. Despite strong Ab production in MIS-C, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing can remain positive for 4-6 wk postinfection. Therefore, we hypothesized that dysfunctional cell-mediated Ab responses downstream of Ab production may be responsible for delayed clearance of viral products in MIS-C. In MIS-C, monocytes were hyperfunctional for phagocytosis and cytokine production, whereas NK cells were hypofunctional for both killing and cytokine production. The decreased NK cell cytotoxicity correlated with an NK exhaustion marker signature and systemic IL-6 levels. Potentially providing a therapeutic option, cellular engagers of CD16 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins were found to rescue NK cell function in vitro. Taken together, our results reveal dysregulation in Ab-mediated cellular responses of myeloid and NK cells that likely contribute to the immune pathology of this disease.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamic features of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binding to the cell membrane and entry cells is crucial for comprehending viral pathogenesis and transmission and facilitating the development of effective drugs against COVID-19. Herein, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to study the binding dynamics between the virus and cell membrane. Our findings revealed that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibited a slightly stronger affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor compared with the Delta variant and was significantly higher than the wild-type (WT). Using a real-time force-tracing technique, we quantified the dynamic parameters for a single SARS-CoV-2 VLP entry into cells, showing that approximately 200 ms and 60 pN are required. The parameters aligned with the analysis obtained from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations. Additionally, the Omicron variant invades cells at a higher entry cell speed, smaller force, and higher probability. Furthermore, single-particle fluorescence tracking visually demonstrated clathrin-dependent endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 entry into A549 cells. The dynamic features of endocytosis provide valuable insights into the SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and possible intervention strategies targeting the viral infection process.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal outbreaks of other respiratory viruses highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals to treat respiratory tract infections. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a key component of innate immune signaling and plays a critical role in protection of the host against viral infections. Previously the STING agonist diABZI-4, a diamidobenzimidazole-based compound, demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV-2 both in vitro and in vivo. However, its broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other respiratory viruses in human airway epithelial cells, which are the primary targets of these infections, is not well established. In this study, we demonstrated that diABZI-4 stimulated robust innate immune responses protecting lung cells against a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), common cold coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, human rhinovirus (HRV), and human parainfluenza virus. diABZI-4 was highly active in physiologically relevant human airway epithelial tissues grown at the air–liquid interface, blocking replication of IAV, SARS-CoV-2, and HRV in these tissues. Furthermore, treatment of macrophages with diABZI-4 resulted in the secretion of cytokines that protected the primary airway epithelial cells from IAV infection. Despite the promising in vitro pan-antiviral activity, intranasal administration of diABZI-4 in mice provided early, but not sustained, inhibition of IAV replication in the lungs. These data highlight the complexities of the relationship between timing of STING agonist-driven inflammatory responses and viral replication dynamics, emphasizing the development challenge posed by STING agonists as potential therapeutics against respiratory viruses.">

 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is still a global public health concern. During March 2022, a rapid and confined single-source outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in a community in Nanjing municipal city. Overall, 95 individuals had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The whole genomes of 61 viral samples were obtained, which were all members of the BA.2.2 lineage and clearly demonstrated the presence of one large clade, and all the infections could be traced back to the original index case. The most distant sequence from the index case presented a difference of 4 SNPs, and 118 intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) at 74 genomic sites were identified. Some minor iSNVs can be transmitted and subsequently rapidly fixed in the viral population. The minor iSNVs transmission resulted in at least 2 nucleotide substitutions among all 7 SNPs identified in the outbreak, generating genetically diverse populations. We estimated the overall transmission bottleneck size to be 3 using 11 convincing donor–recipient transmission pairs. Our study provides new insights into genomic epidemiology and viral transmission, revealing how iSNVs become fixed in local clusters, followed by viral transmission across the community, which contributes to population diversity.">

These immune changes in T lymphocytes are closely associated with disease progression, but the specific mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation. This paper reviewed the changes in the number and function of T cells in respiratory viral infections, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2, and summarized related therapeutic explorations. We believe that improving and enhancing the number and function of T lymphocytes in infected hosts is a promising strategy for the treatment of respiratory viral infections, although more systematic and in-depth scientific research is still needed.">

        <tr id="Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with gastrointestinal symptoms a prominent feature. This syndrome has been proposed to be triggered by persistent SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia due to increased intestinal epithelial permeability. We obtained evidence for this in this study. Methods: In a single-centre study, we recruited 83 children and analysed blood samples to quantify the circulating markers of increased intestinal permeability following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Publicly available proteomics MIS-C datasets were also accessed to assess the evidence for increased intestinal permeability. We further quantified SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Results: Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, healthy children demonstrated no dysregulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier. In MIS-C, considerable increases in markers of epithelial dysfunction were observed, with similar increases noted in febrile controls. Furthermore, we found little evidence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia in MIS-C. Conclusions: Our results suggest that although increased intestinal epithelial permeability is a feature of MIS-C, it is not unique to the condition, and persistent SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia does not occur.">

In the recent past, SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral infection has been responsible for most infectious complications in HMs. We analyzed 2950 samples from 505 patients admitted to the Hematology department from 2019 to 2023. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological trend of respiratory viruses in the SARS-CoV-2 era, the characteristics of the patients involved and their outcomes. In our analysis, we found a reduction in non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral (NSRV) positivity during the pandemic period, although these data did not show statistical significance. Most of the HMs involved were Multiple Myeloma and Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Overall mortality rate was very low and characterized by the progression of the HMs as well as the worsening of respiratory failure. In conclusion, a reduction in non-COVID viral infections was highlighted, probably also thanks to the increase in prevention measures and environmental modifications of the viral background.">

        <tr id="Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide with devastating immediate or long-term effects on people’s health. Although the lungs are the primary organ affected by COVID-19, individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 also develop systemic lesions involving multiple organs throughout the body, such as the cardiovascular system. Emerging evidence reveals that COVID-19 could generate myocardial fibrosis, termed “COVID-19-associated myocardial fibrosis.” It can result from the activation of fibroblasts via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), microRNAs, and other pathways, and can also occur in other cellular interactions with SARS-CoV-2, such as immunocytes, endothelial cells. Nonetheless, to gain a more profound insight into the natural progression of COVID-19-related myocardial fibrosis, additional investigations are necessary. This review delves into the underlying mechanisms contributing to COVID-19-associated myocardial fibrosis while also examining the antifibrotic potential of current COVID-19 treatments, thereby offering guidance for future clinical trials of these medications. Ultimately, we propose future research directions for COVID-19-associated myocardial fibrosis in the post-COVID-19 era, such as artificial intelligence (AI) telemedicine. We also recommend that relevant tests be added to the follow-up of COVID-19 patients to detect myocardial fibrosis promptly.">

This has elicited an immediate need for accelerated research into its mechanisms of disease, criteria for diagnosis, methods for forecasting outcomes, and treatment approaches. microRNAs (miRNAs), are diminutive RNA molecules, that are non-coding and participate in gene expression regulation post-transcriptionally, having an important participation in regulating immune processes. miRNAs have granted substantial interest in their impact on viral replication, cell proliferation, and modulation of how the host’s immune system responds. This narrative review delves into host miRNAs’ multifaceted roles within the COVID-19 context, highlighting their involvement in disease progression, diagnostics, and prognostics aspects, given their stability in biological fluids and varied expression profiles when responding to an infection. Additionally, we discuss complicated interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and host cellular machinery facilitated by host miRNAs revealing how dysregulation of host miRNA expression profiles advances viral replication, immune evasion, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, it investigates the potential of host miRNAs as therapeutic agents, whether synthetic or naturally occurring, which could be harnessed to either mitigate harmful inflammation or enhance antiviral responses. However, searching more deeply is needed to clarify how host’s miRNAs are involved in pathogenesis of COVID-19, its diagnosis processes, prognostic assessments, and treatment approaches for patients.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a crucial role in regulation of immune response. It is believed that excessive activity of Treg cells in the early stages of infectious diseases reduces the pro-inflammatory activity of cells in the innate and adaptive immune response, thereby contributing to the development of chronic inflammation or excessive inflammation. Additionally, it is known that aging leads to changes in the quantity of Treg cells and disrupts their activity. It is established that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to fatal and severe cases of the disease, primarily among the elderly population. However, the underlying cause of the development of severe forms in elderly individuals remains incompletely understood. Thus, we hypothesized that the dysregulation of the Treg cell activity in elderly individuals may contribute to the development of severe forms and lethality from SARS-CoV-2, leading to the emergence of hyper inflammation in this population. 
To investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the immunosuppressive properties of Treg cells, venous blood samples were obtained from young healthy volunteers and elderly individuals. Dendritic cells were obtained by PBMC adhesion on plastic. Adherent monocytes were cultured in cytokine medium with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF), with addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 48 hours and incubated for an additional 24 hours with S1 or N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The obtained dendritic cells presenting SARS-CoV-2 antigens were then co-cultured with autologous CD4+-T lymphocytes ex vivo. The expression level of immunosuppressive membrane-associated and soluble molecules expressed by Treg cells was assessed using flow cytometry. 
Our results indicate that the immunosuppressive activity of Treg cells exhibits contrasting patterns in the two donor groups studied in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The proportion of Treg cells, as well as the expression levels of the immunosuppressive molecules, including tumor growth factor beta (TGF-b), CD39, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related (GITR) protein, and the levels of the intracellular immunosuppressive cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-35, in Treg cells obtained from peripheral blood of elderly donors, significantly increased in response to the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo, when compared to the group of young donors. Conversely, in the group of young donors were observed a decrease in the expression of these markers and an increase in the concentration of extracellular pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ ex vivo, which activate the effector immune cells and contribute to virus elimination. 
In summary, the presented results suggest that Treg cells derived from elderly individuals exhibit elevated immunosuppressive activity in response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens ex vivo. Obtained results may indicate that in elderly individuals on the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection Treg cells may also possess enhanced immunosuppressive activity, which may contribute to the overall suppression of anti-viral immune responses, thereby potentially leading to the delayed SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance and development of severe forms of the disease.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

This cohort study examined the expression of p53, Bcl-2, Bid, Bak, and Bax molecules, the genes associated with induction or inhibition of apoptosis, in the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe and mild symptoms in an Iranian population. In this 6-month cohort study, the expression of p53, Bcl-2, Bid, Bak, and Bax molecules was evaluated at onset of diagnosis, 24 h after symptom onset, and 6 months later in the nasopharyngeal cells of SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients and outpatients in comparison with healthy controls using the real-time PCR technique. At the onset of the study, the relative expression of p53, Bcl-2, Bid, Bak, and Bax significantly increased in the SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients and decreased after 6 months. The healthy controls showed potential positive correlations among the molecules, but the patients did not show these correlations. Since SARS-CoV-2 needs host cell survival, it appears that the virus induces the expression of Bcl-2 as an antiapoptotic molecule, and the host cells upregulate the proapoptotic molecules to neutralize the effects. Dysregulation of correlation expression of the molecules among the patients proved that SARS-CoV-2 affects the expression of the molecules involved in apoptosis. SARS-CoV-2 could be considered an important factor that regulates the expression of several molecules participating in cancer pathogenesis.">

Protein and pathway analyses showed significant alterations in neurotransmission and potentially, neuronal excitotoxicity. Elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and neurofilament light (NfL) confirmed glutamate excitotoxicity to be a key mechanism contributing to neuronal toxicity in HPeV-3 infection and can lead to apoptosis induced by caspase signaling. These insights are pivotal in delineating the metabolic landscape following severe HPeV-3 CNS infection and may identify potential host targets for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Insufficient information on the immune response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), an essential component in developing effective vaccines and therapies, is a critical issue. Consequently, establishing clinical methods for evaluating immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and validating the direct participation of the parameters in the development of adaptive immune responses are necessary. Furthermore, a comprehensive guide to the diseases caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is critical. Employing universal and non-specific early cytokines, specifically, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in immune clinics during immune response assessments, presents potential in several respects. IFN-gamma promotes the production of other antiviral molecules and stimulates immune system responses against the virus. Nonetheless, reports indicated that some individuals with severe COVID-19 exhibited impaired IFN-gamma production, which might contribute to the severity of the illness. Enhancing IFN-gamma synthesis or exogenous IFN-gamma therapy has demonstrated potential as a COVID-19 treatment approach. Significant IL-6 levels are associated with cytokine storm progression, which denotes excessive and uncontrolled immune responses that could lead to tissue damage. Targeting IL-6 with specific inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies, could reduce COVID-19 severity in certain patients. The results obtained in this study indicated that blood electrolytes and immune variable levels (interleukin 6 and IFN-gamma) were significantly different among the infected, vaccinated, and control groups.">

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="In this study, we report on longitudinal kinetics of cellular immune subsets following SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of hospitalized individuals and evaluate the interplay of these profiles with infecting viral variants, humoral immunity including neutralizing responses, vaccination history and clinical outcomes. A cohort of 121 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals exhibiting varying disease states were prospectively evaluated for lymphopenic profiles, anti-viral humoral responses and infecting viral variants for a period of up to 90 days spanning the period, February 2021-January 2022 (2nd and 3rd waves of infection). A total of 51 participants received at least one vaccine dose of indigenous vaccines (Covishield or Covaxin) prior to recruitment. When stratified in terms of mortality, B and NK cells, in contrast to the T cell compartment, did not recover from nadir levels in non-survivors who were largely unvaccinated. No discriminatory signature was identified for non-survivors in terms of anti-NC or anti-S1-RBD IgG CLIA profiles including GenScript S1-RBD assays. Evaluation of sVCAM and sMAdCAM revealed opposing dynamics that correlated with disease severity and convalescence respectively. Viral variant analysis revealed delta and omicron variants to comprise majority of the infections which reflected national transmission kinetics during the period of recruitment. Our results demonstrate the importance of monitoring circulating biomarkers for convalescence as well as mortality in COVID-19 progression. Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 clearly demonstrated increased pathogenicity and warrants sustained viral surveillance for re-emergence of these strains. Our findings with respect to vaccination advocate for continued vaccine development and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.">

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving continuously, and many variants have been detected over the last few years. SARS-CoV-2, as an RNA virus, is more prone to mutating. The continuous evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is due to genetic mutation and recombination during the genomic replication process. Recombination is a naturally occurring phenomenon in which two distinct viral lineages simultaneously infect the same cellular entity in an individual. The evolution rate depends on the rate of mutation. The rate of mutation is variable among the RNA viruses, with the SARS-CoV-2 virus exhibiting a lower rate of mutation than other RNA viruses. The novel 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease proofreading machinery is responsible for a lower rate of mutation. Infection due to the SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus has been reported from around the world during the same period of fall and winter, resulting in a "tripledemic." The JN.1 variant, which evolved from the predecessor, the omicron variant BA.2.86, is currently the most dominant globally. The impact of the JN.1 variant on transmissibility, disease severity, immune evasion, and diagnostic and therapeutic escape will be discussed.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmittable respiratory virus that causes COVID-19 disease. Since its emergence in the early 2000s, SARS has posed significant public health challenges and continues to be a concern. This review provides an overview of current treatment strategies for SARS-CoV and explores the potential utility of herbal molecules in combating this viral infection. The primary treatment approach for SARS-CoV has historically centered on supportive care, which includes oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and antipyretic medications to manage symptoms. However, with the ongoing advancement of medical research and our evolving understanding of the virus, several antiviral drugs have been developed and repurposed to target SARS-CoV. Recent developments in the field of herbal medicine have drawn attention to the potential efficacy of natural compounds in the management of viral infections, including SARS. Herbal molecules, characterized by their diverse bioactive constituents, exhibit antiviral properties that could be harnessed to mitigate SARS symptoms and inhibit viral replication. Ocimum sanctum, Tinospora cordifolia, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Panax ginseng, and Aloe vera have been identified for their immunomodulatory effects. This review highlights promising herbal molecules such as quercetin, and curcumin, which have demonstrated antiviral effects in–vitro and in some preclinical studies. While current treatment strategies for SARS primarily rely on supportive care and antiviral medications, the exploration of herbal molecules presents an exciting avenue for potential adjunctive therapies. Further research is required to validate their efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action. A holistic approach that combines conventional medicine with herbal remedies may offer new insights into the treatment of SARS and other viral respiratory illnesses.">

        <tr id="Problem COVID-19 during pregnancy is linked to increased maternal morbidity and a higher incidence of preterm births, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage (γH2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis, particularly affecting the elderly, who are more susceptible to severe outcomes. However, definitive parameters or mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in elderly people remain confused. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the mechanism behind the increased vulnerability of elderly individuals to severe COVID-19. We employed an aged mouse model with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain to mimic the severe symptoms observed in elderly patients with COVID-19. Comprehensive analyses of the whole lung were performed using transcriptome and proteome sequencing, comparing data from aged and young mice. For transcriptome analysis, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted using an Illumina sequencing platform. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry following protein extraction, digestion, and peptide labeling. We analyzed the transcriptome and proteome profiles of young and aged mice and discovered that aged mice exhibited elevated baseline levels of inflammation and tissue damage repair. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, aged mice showed increased antiviral and inflammatory responses; however, these responses were weaker than those in young mice, with significant complement and coagulation cascade responses. In summary, our study demonstrates that the increased vulnerability of the elderly to severe COVID-19 can be attributed to an attenuated antiviral response and the overactivation of complement and coagulation cascades.">

        <tr id="Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and mediating antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system. Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1 A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells are associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 9.27 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.0269). We further reveal ADAR1 expression increases with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggests A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Coronaviruses (CoV) emerge suddenly from animal reservoirs to cause novel diseases in new hosts. Discovered in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in camels in the Middle East and is continually causing local outbreaks and epidemics. While all three newly emerging human CoV from past 20 years (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) cause respiratory disease, each CoV has unique host interactions that drive differential pathogeneses. To better understand the virus and host interactions driving lethal MERS-CoV infection, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics analysis of sublethal and lethal MERS-CoV infection in mice. Significant differences were observed in body weight loss, virus titers and acute lung injury among lethal and sub-lethal virus doses. Virus induced apoptosis of type I and II alveolar epithelial cells suggest that loss or dysregulation of these key cell populations was a major driver of severe disease. Omics analysis suggested differential pathogenesis was multi-factorial with clear differences among innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as those that regulate lung epithelial homeostasis. Infection of mice lacking functional T and B-cells showed that adaptive immunity was important in controlling viral replication but also increased pathogenesis. In summary, we provide a high-resolution host response atlas for MERS-CoV infection and disease severity. Multi-omics studies of viral pathogenesis offer a unique opportunity to not only better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease but also to identify genes and pathways that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention all of which is important for our future pandemic preparedness. Importance Emerging coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV cause a range of disease outcomes in humans from asymptomatic, moderate and severe respiratory disease which can progress to death but the factors causing these disparate outcomes remain unclear. Understanding host responses to mild and life-threatening infection provides insight into virus-host networks within and across organ systems that contribute to disease outcomes. We used multi-omics approaches to comprehensively define the host response to moderate and severe MERS-CoV infection. Severe respiratory disease was associated with dysregulation of the immune response. Key lung epithelial cell populations that are essential for lung function get infected and die. Mice lacking key immune cell populations experienced greater virus replication but decreased disease severity implicating the immune system in both protective and pathogenic roles in the response to MERS-CoV. These data could be utilized to design new therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathways that contribute to severe disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory infections are a major health burden worldwide. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the leading causes of hospitalization in both young children and older adults. The onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the public health response had a profound impact on the normal seasonal outbreaks of other respiratory viruses. However, little is known about how a prior respiratory virus infection impacts SARS-CoV-2 disease outcomes. In this study, we examine the impact of a previous RSV infection on the disease severity of a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 challenge in BALB/c mice. Mice infected with RSV, followed by a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, 30 days later, exhibited decreased weight loss and increased survival as compared to control groups. Our results suggest a prior RSV infection can provide protection against a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and respiratory syncytial virus are respiratory viruses that are a major health burden worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and respiratory syncytial virus frequently have peak seasonal outbreaks during the winter months, and are capable of causing severe respiratory disease, often leading to hospitalization. The 2019 pandemic brought attention to the importance of understanding how co-circulating viruses can impact the disease severity of other respiratory viruses. It is known that many hospitalized patients are undergoing multiple viral infections at once, yet not much has been studied to understand the impact this has on other respiratory viruses or patients. How co-circulating viruses impact one another can provide critical knowledge for future interventions of hospitalized patients and potential vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="Bats are tolerant to highly pathogenic viruses such as Marburg, Ebola, and Nipah, suggesting the presence of a unique immune tolerance toward viral infection. Here, we compared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of human and bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) pluripotent cells and fibroblasts. Since bat cells do not express an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that allows virus infection, we transduced the human ACE2 (hA) receptor into the cells and found that transduced cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Compared to human embryonic stem cells-hA, infected bat induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-hA produced about a 100-fold lower level of infectious virus and displayed lower toxicity. In contrast, bat embryonic fibroblast-hA produced no infectious virus while being infectable and synthesizing viral RNA and proteins, suggesting abortive infection. Indeed, electron microscopy failed to detect virus-like particles in infected bat fibroblasts in contrast to bat iPSCs or human cells, consistent with the latter producing infectious viruses. This suggests that bat somatic but not pluripotent cells have an effective mechanism to control virus replication. Consistent with previous results by others, we find that bat cells have a constitutively activated innate immune system, which might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to human cells.">

        <tr id="From the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6, was detected in serum from patients. As a consequence, several anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Dexamethasone (a strong corticoid), were used to counteract such cytokine storm occurring during severe disease. By contrast, pro-inflammatory interleukin 11 (IL11), a member of the IL6 family, was detected in respiratory tissues from infected patients and in experimental epithelial cellular models. In this work, human A549 lung epithelial cells were individually transduced with SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs), resulting in a IL11 increase, which was significantly decreased after Dexamethasone treatment. The use of this cellular platform allowed us to screen for new possible anti-inflammatory compounds from Fasciola hepatica. Our results highlighted the ability of FhNEJ (Fasciola hepatica newly excysted juvenile flukes) somatic extract to decrease IL11 levels in ORF-transduced cells. These results emphasized the role of IL11 in lung epithelial inflammation, making it a potential target for future treatments of lung inflammation which occurs in COVID-19, and validate the use of these ORF-expressing cells as a cellular platform to test anti-inflammatory compounds for COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
To date, there are limited options for severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. As ADP-ribosylation events are involved in regulating the life cycle of coronaviruses and the inflammatory reactions of the host; we have, here, assessed the repurposing of registered PARP inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19.


EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
The effects of PARP inhibitors on virus uptake were assessed in cell-based experiments using multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2. The binding of rucaparib to spike protein was tested by molecular modelling and microcalorimetry. The anti-inflammatory properties of rucaparib were demonstrated in cell-based models upon challenging with recombinant spike protein or SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine.


KEY RESULTS
We detected high levels of oxidative stress and strong PARylation in all cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, both of which negatively correlated with lymphocytopaenia. Interestingly, rucaparib, unlike other tested PARP inhibitors, reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate through binding to the conserved 493-498 amino acid region located in the spike-ACE2 interface in the spike protein and prevented viruses from binding to ACE2. In addition, the spike protein and viral RNA-induced overexpression of cytokines was down-regulated by the inhibition of PARP1 by rucaparib at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.


CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
These results point towards repurposing rucaparib for treating inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The primary challenge posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is COVID-19-related mortality, often exacerbated by additional medical complications, such as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Up to half of COVID-19 patients experience kidney complications, with those facing acute respiratory failure and kidney injury having the worst overall prognosis. Despite the significant impact of CAKI on COVID-19-related mortality and its enduring effects in long COVID, the underlying causes and molecular mechanisms of CAKI remain elusive. In this study, we identified a functional relationship between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a protein and inflammation-driven apoptotic death of renal tubular epithelial cells in patients with CAKI. We demonstrate in vitro that ORF3a independently induces renal cell-specific apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by the elevation of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and the activation of NF-kB-mediated proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-6) production. By examining kidney tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-ACE2 transgenic mice, we observed a similar correlation between ORF3a-induced cytopathic changes and kidney injury. This correlation was further validated through reconstitution of the ORF3a effects via direct adenoviral injection into mouse kidneys. Through medicinal analysis, we identified a natural compound, glycyrrhizin (GL4419), which not only blocks viral replication in renal cells, but also mitigates ORF3a-induced renal cell death by inhibiting activation of a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, leading to a reduction of KIM-1. Moreover, ORF3a interacts with HMGB1. Overproduction or downregulation of hmgb1 expression results in correlative changes in renal cellular KIM-1 response and respective cytokine production, implicating a crucial role of HMGB1 in ORF3a-inflicted kidney injuries. Our data suggest a direct functional link between ORF3a and kidney injury, highlighting ORF3a as a unique therapeutic target contributing to CAKI.


IMPORTANCE
The major challenge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during the pandemic is COVID-19-related mortality, which has tragically claimed millions of lives. COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are often exacerbated by pre-existing medical conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), or the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to COVID-19, collectively known as COVID-19-associated kidney injuries (CAKIs). Patients who experience acute respiratory failure with CAKI have the poorest clinical outcomes, including increased mortality. Despite these alarming clinical findings, there is a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying causes of CAKI. Our study establishes a direct correlation between the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral ORF3a protein and kidney injury induced by ORF3a linking to CAKI. This functional relationship was initially observed in our clinical studies of COVID-19 patients with AKI and was further validated through animal and in vitro cellular studies, either by expressing ORF3a alone or in the context of viral infection. By elucidating this functional relationship and its underlying mechanistic pathways, our research deepens the understanding of COVID-19-associated kidney diseases and presents potential therapeutic avenues to address the healthcare challenges faced by individuals with underlying conditions.">

        <tr id="The yellow fever virus 17D (YFV-17D) live attenuated vaccine is considered one of the successful vaccines ever generated associated with high antiviral immunity, yet the signaling mechanisms that drive the response in infected cells are not understood. Here, we provide a molecular understanding of how metabolic stress and innate immune responses are linked to drive type I IFN expression in response to YFV-17D infection. Comparison of YFV-17D replication with its parental virus, YFV-Asibi, and a related dengue virus revealed that IFN expression requires RIG-I-like Receptor signaling through MAVS, as expected. However, YFV-17D uniquely induces mitochondrial respiration and major metabolic perturbations, including hyperactivation of electron transport to fuel ATP synthase. Mitochondrial hyperactivity generates reactive oxygen species (mROS) and peroxynitrite, blocking of which abrogated IFN expression in non-immune cells without reducing YFV-17D replication. Scavenging ROS in YFV-17D-infected human dendritic cells increased cell viability yet globally prevented expression of IFN signaling pathways. Thus, adaptation of YFV-17D for high growth uniquely imparts mitochondrial hyperactivity generating mROS and peroxynitrite as the critical messengers that convert a blunted IFN response into maximal activation of innate immunity essential for vaccine effectiveness.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented global challenges with a diverse clinical spectrum, including severe respiratory complications and systemic effects. This review explores the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, aging, and obesity in COVID-19. Mitochondria are vital for cellular energy provision and resilience against age-related macromolecule damage accumulation. They manage energy allocation in cells, activating adaptive responses and stress signals such as redox imbalance and innate immunity activation. As organisms age, mitochondrial function diminishes. Aging and obesity, linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, compromise the antiviral response, affecting the release of interferons, and worsening COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID has been associated with altered energy metabolism, and chronic immune dysregulation derived from mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding the interplay between mitochondria, aging, obesity, and viral infections provides insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis. Targeting mitochondrial health may offer potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate severe outcomes and address long-term consequences in infected individuals.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 remains a significant threat to public health globally. Infection in some susceptible individuals causes life-threatening acute lung injury (ALI/ARDS) and/or death. Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) is a C-type lectin expressed in the lung and other mucosal tissues, and it plays a critical role in host defense against various pathogens. The human SP-A genes (SFTPA1 and SFTPA2) are highly polymorphic and comprise several common genetic variants, i.e., SP-A1 (variants 6A2, 6A4) and SP-A2 (variants 1A0, 1A3). Here, we elucidated the differential antiviral and immunoregulatory roles of SP-A variants in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Six genetically-modified mouse lines, expressing both hACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and individual SP-A variants: (hACE2/6A2 (6A2), hACE2/6A4 (6A4), hACE2/1A0 (1A0), and hACE2/1A3(1A3), one SP-A knockout (hACE2/SP-A KO (KO) and one hACE2/mouse SP-A (K18) mice, were challenged intranasally with 103 PFU SARS-CoV-2 or saline (Sham). Infected KO and 1A0 mice had more weight loss and mortality compared to other mouse lines. Relative to other infected mouse lines, a more severe ALI was observed in KO, 1A0, and 6A2 mice. Reduced viral titers were generally observed in the lungs of infected SP-A mice relative to KO mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed an upregulation in genes that play central roles in immune responses such as MyD88, Stat3, IL-18, and Jak2 in the lungs of KO and 1A0 mice. However, Mapk1 was significantly downregulated in 6A2 versus 1A0 mice. Analysis of biological pathways identified those involved in lung host defense and innate immunity, including pathogen-induced cytokine, NOD1/2, and Trem1 signaling pathways. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, levels of cytokines and chemokines such as G-CSF, IL-6 and IL-1β were comparatively higher in the lungs and sera of KO and 1A0 mice with the highest mortality rate. These findings demonstrate that human SP-A variants differentially modulate SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury and disease severity by differentially inhibiting viral infectivity and regulating immune-related gene expressions.">

        <tr id="Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung has been extensively studied, the molecular regulators and targets of the host-cell programs hijacked by the virus in distinct human airway epithelial cell populations remain poorly understood. This is in part ascribed to the use of non-primary cell systems, overreliance on single-cell gene expression profiling that not ultimately reflect protein activity and bias toward the downstream effects rather than their mechanistic determinants. Here we address these issues by network-based analysis of single cell transcriptomic profiles of pathophysiologically relevant human adult basal, ciliated and secretory cells to identify master regulator (MR) protein modules controlling their SARS-CoV-2-mediated reprogramming. This uncovered chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathway as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR analyses as components of the host response collectively or selectively activated in these cells. Large-scale perturbation assays, using a clinically-relevant drug library, identified 11 drugs able to invert the entire MR signature activated by SARS-CoV-2 in these cell types. Leveraging MR analysis and perturbational profiles of human primary cells, represents a novel mechanism-based approach and resource that can be directly generalized to interrogate signatures of other airway conditions for drug prioritization.">

        <tr id="While the World Health Organization has declared the end of the SARS-CoV-2 public health emergency, studies related to corona viruses are still under course. As of 2024, the severity of COVID-19 has diminished with current treatments and vaccinations. However, individuals can still face severe complications, highlighting the importance of ongoing research into innovative treatments for current and future coronavirus-related diseases. This study approaches the mechanism of viral entrance into the host cells and the current evidence on the use of sulfhydryl groups for the COVID-19 treatment. Certain thiol drugs, a key contributor to inflammatory processes, exhibit both viral inhibition properties and the potential to regulate cellular oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. Herein, we developed biocompatible thiol-functionalized carbon dots (CDs) and investigated the correlation between the number of thiols and pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and anti-inflammatory response. The free-radical scavenging experiment and the ROS cellular assay indicate that thiolated CDs serve as effective reducing agents and potential regulators of cellular oxidative stress. The CDs also demonstrated good cell viability alongside significant antiviral capabilities, with inhibition levels up to 60.4%. Furthermore, the flow cytometry results suggest that in an inflammatory environment, the presence of thiolated CDs promotes an anti-inflammatory response. Overall, the results demonstrate a strong correlation between the number of thiols and the increased efficacy observed across experiments, presenting thiolated CDs as promising candidates to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection.">

        <tr id="Mucosal barrier integrity is vital for homeostasis with commensal organisms while preventing pathogen invasion. We unexpectedly found that fungal-induced immunosurveillance enhances resistance to fungal outgrowth and tissue invasion by remodeling the oral mucosal epithelial barrier in mouse models of adult and neonatal Candida albicans colonization. Epithelial subset expansion and tissue remodeling were dependent on interleukin-22 (IL-22) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, through a non-canonical receptor complex composed of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) coupled with IL-22RA1 and IL-10RB. Immunosurveillance-induced epithelial remodeling was restricted to the oral mucosa, whereas barrier architecture was reset once fungal-specific immunity developed. Collectively, these findings identify fungal-induced transient mucosal remodeling as a critical determinant of resistance to mucosal fungal infection during early stages of microbial colonization.">

        <tr id="The primary immune constituents in the brain, microglia and macrophages, are the target for HIV in people and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological dysfunction, known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Given the gaps in our knowledge on how these cells respond in vivo to CNS infection, we performed single-cell multiomic sequencing, including gene expression and ATAC-seq, on myeloid cells from the brains of rhesus macaques with SIV-induced encephalitis (SIVE) as well as uninfected controls. We found that the myeloid cell populations were significantly changed by SIVE. In SIVE microglia-like cells express high levels of chemoattractants capable of recruiting highly activated CAM-like cells to the site of infection/inflammation. A unique population of microglia-like cells was found in which the chromatin accessibility of genes diverged from their RNA expression. Additionally, we observed a dramatic shift of upstream gene regulators and their targets in brain myeloid cells during SIVE. In summary, this study further uncovers the transcriptome, gene regulatory events and potential roles of different brain myeloid phenotypes in SIVE.">

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, advanced age has emerged as a major predictor of disease severity. Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms explaining how old age constitutes a critical risk factor remains elusive. To unravel this, we designed an animal study, juxtaposing the course of COVID-19 in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15-22 months) mice. Both groups of K18(hACE2) mice were intranasally exposed to 500 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with a variety of outcomes assessed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infections (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, RNA, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable distinctions between the two groups, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance at 7 DPI, correlating with diminished survival rates together with an absence of weight loss recovery at 6-7 DPI. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient Th1 response characterized by diminished productions of IFNg, CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL9 relative to younger mice. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. Collectively, disease severity implies a dysregulation of the antiviral response in elderly-infected mice relative to younger mice, resulting in compromised viral clearance and a more unfavorable prognosis. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19. Author summary In this study, we investigated why older age is linked to more severe COVID-19 outcomes by comparing the progression of the disease in young (2 months) and elderly (15-22 months) K18(hACE2) mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. After exposing both groups to the virus, we assessed various factors such as viral loads, immune responses, and lipid profiles in the lungs at different time points. Our findings revealed that elderly mice struggled to clear the virus by day 7 post-infection, leading to higher mortality rates and poorer recovery compared to younger mice. Aged mice showed weaker immune responses, with reduced production of key antiviral proteins like IFNg and certain chemokines. Lipid analysis also highlighted differences in molecules involved in immune regulation and lung protection, such as decreased levels of pro-resolving lipids and increased lipids associated with lung injury. These results suggest that older mice have a compromised antiviral defense, which could inform new therapeutic approaches for elderly patients with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant exhibits high transmissibility with a strong immune escape ability and causes frequent large-scale global infections by producing predominant subvariants. Here, using human upper/lower airway and intestinal cells, we examined the previously dominant BA.1–BA.5 and BA.2.75 subvariants, together with the recently emerged XBB/BQ lineages, in comparison to the former Delta variant. We observed a tendency for each virus to demonstrate higher growth capability than the previously dominant subvariants. Unlike human bronchial and intestinal cells, nasal epithelial cells accommodated the efficient entry of certain Omicron subvariants, similar to the Delta variant. In contrast to the Delta’s reliance on cell-surface transmembrane protease serine 2, all tested Omicron variants depended on endosomal cathepsin L. Moreover, S1/S2 cleavage of early Omicron spikes was less efficient, whereas recent viruses exhibit improved cleavage efficacy. Our results show that the Omicron variant progressively adapts to human cells through continuous endosome-mediated host cell entry. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, has evolved into a number of variants/subvariants, which have generated multiple global waves of infection. In order to monitor/predict virological features of emerging variants and determine appropriate strategies for anti-viral development, understanding conserved or altered features of evolving SARS-CoV-2 is important. In this study, we addressed previously or recently predominant Omicron subvariants and demonstrated the gradual adaptation to human cells. The host cell entry route, which was altered from the former Delta variant, was conserved among all tested Omicron subvariants. Collectively, this study revealed both changing and maintained features of SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron variant evolution.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may have diminished serologic response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination and increased risk for subsequent severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. We sought to describe outcomes among those who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination, characterize SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 1 year post-vaccination, and identify factors associated with durable serologic response.


METHODS
We recruited children with IBD who received ≥2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and prospectively collected data on (1) demographics, IBD characteristics, and therapy and (2) SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, testing, and infection symptoms. Serum was obtained for measurement of anti-receptor-binding domain IgG antibodies following a 2-part immunization at 12 and 52 weeks.


RESULTS
We enrolled 298 participants (mean age 11.9 ± 3.82, 50% female, 67% Crohn's disease). Symptomatic COVID-19 infection after vaccination occurred in half of the participants, although only 2 (1%) required hospitalization. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was associated with higher likelihood of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5-5.0; P = .001). Nearly all participants (99%) had detectable antibody at Week 52. Children aged 1-5 years had lower 52-week antibody level compared to older children (P = .04), as did those on anti-TNF-α therapy (P = .007) and those who received only 2 vaccine doses prior to Week 52 (P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provides lasting serologic response and protection against severe COVID-19 for most children with IBD, despite the use of lower vaccine doses in younger children and wide-ranging classes of immunosuppressive therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cutaneous mycobacterial infections cause substantial morbidity and are challenging to diagnose and treat. An improved understanding of the dermal immune response to mycobacteria may inspire new therapeutic approaches. We conducted a controlled human infection study with 10 participants who received 2 × 106 CFUs of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (Tice strain) intradermally and were randomized to receive isoniazid or no treatment. Peripheral blood was collected at multiple time points for flow cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and serum Ab assessments. Systemic immune responses were detected as early as 8 d postchallenge in this M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin–naive population. Injection-site skin biopsies were performed at days 3 and 15 postchallenge and underwent immune profiling using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq, as well as quantitative assessments of bacterial viability and burden. Molecular viability testing and standard culture results correlated well, although no differences were observed between treatment arms. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed various immune and nonimmune cell types in the skin, and communication between them was inferred by ligand-receptor gene expression. Day 3 communication was predominantly directed toward monocytes from keratinocyte, muscle, epithelial, and endothelial cells, largely via the migration inhibitory factor pathway and HLA-E–KLRK1 interaction. At day 15, communication was more balanced between cell types. These data reveal the potential role of nonimmune cells in the dermal immune response to mycobacteria and the utility of human challenge studies to augment our understanding of mycobacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Background. Currently, the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute damage to organs and systems caused by coronavirus infection have been studied quite fully, but the mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of long COVID have not yet been accurately described. The mechanisms of persistence of a number of symptoms in patients who have had COVID-19 and the role of systemic inflammation and endotoxemia markers in it remain a understudied aspect and a promising direction for further studying.The aim of the study. To assess the markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability and endothelial dysfunction in patients with long COVID at the stage of health resort treatment.Methods. The study included 32 patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection and were undergoing health resort treatment in the pulmonology department of the I.M. Sechenov Academic Research Institute for Physical Therapy, Medical Climatology and Rehabilitation. We also selected a control group (n = 20). All patients underwent peripheral blood analysis to detect the levels of markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxin-releasing systems, intestinal permeability, endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstrictor agents: C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LPB), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), zonulin, bactericidal/ permeability-increasing protein (BPI), vasopressors of angiotensin 2 and endothelin (EDN1).Results. Patients who had recovered from coronavirus infection had a statistically significant increase in the levels of CRP (3.4 [2.56; 4.0] mg/l), LBP (18.46 [14.0; 25.5] ng/ml), tPA (0.07 [0.02; 0.32] ng/ml), angiotensin 2 (133.3 [63.0; 503.7] pg/ml) and a decrease in the level of BPI (1576 [276; 3588] pg/ml) (p < 0.05).Conclusion. A statistically significant increase in markers of systemic inflammation, endotoxinemia, and vasoconstrictor agents in patients with long COVID indicates an imbalance in endotoxin-binding and endotoxin-releasing systems in patients who have had coronavirus infection. Further study of the described markers is necessary to improve approaches to long-term personalized therapy for this category of patients.">

        <tr id="While several viral infections have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the mechanism(s) through which they promote disease has remained almost entirely elusive. This study investigated the impact of common, acute viral infections prior to disease onset on ALS progression in the SOD1G93A mouse model. A single sublethal infection prior to onset of ALS clinical signs was associated with markedly accelerated ALS disease progression characterized by rapid loss of hindlimb function. Prior infection resulted in gliosis in the lumbar spine and upregulation of transcriptional pathways involved in inflammatory responses, metabolic dysregulation, and muscular dysfunction. Therapeutic suppression of gliosis with an anti-inflammatory small molecule, or administration of a direct-acting antiviral, was associated with significantly improved ALS clinical signs, akin to what was observed in uninfected animals. This study provides causal and mechanistic evidence that the immune response elicited by acute viral infections may be an important etiological factor that alters ALS disease trajectory, and provides insight into novel therapeutic and preventative strategies for ALS.

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a poliomyelitis-like illness causing paralysis in young children. However, mechanisms of paralysis are unclear, and antiviral therapies are lacking. To better understand EV-D68 disease, we inoculated newborn mice intracranially to assess viral tropism, virulence, and immune responses. Wild-type (WT) mice inoculated intracranially with a neurovirulent strain of EV-D68 showed infection of spinal cord neurons and developed paralysis. Spinal tissue from infected mice revealed increased levels of chemokines, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and T cells relative to controls, suggesting that immune cell infiltration influences pathogenesis. To define the contribution of cytokine-mediated immune cell recruitment to disease, we inoculated mice lacking CCR2, a receptor for several EV-D68-upregulated cytokines, or RAG1, which is required for lymphocyte maturation. WT, Ccr2-/-, and Rag1-/- mice had comparable viral titers in spinal tissue. However, Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice had significantly less paralysis relative to WT mice. Consistent with impaired T cell recruitment to sites of infection in Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice, antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from WT mice diminished paralysis. These results indicate that immune cell recruitment to the spinal cord promotes EV-D68-associated paralysis and illuminate new targets for therapeutic intervention. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="The unprecedented research effort associated with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) included several extensive proteomic studies that identified host proteins that interact with individual viral gene products. However, in most cases, the consequences of those virus–host interactions for virus replication were not experimentally pursued, which is a necessary step in determining whether the interactions represent pro- or anti-viral events. One putative interaction commonly identified in multiple studies was between the host adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) subunit B1 (AP3B1) and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein (E). AP3B1 is one subunit of AP-3 required for the biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles (LROs), and its function impacts important disease processes including inflammation and vascular health. Thus, interactions between AP3B1 and SARS-CoV-2 might influence the clinical outcomes of infection. To determine if AP3B1 has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, we first confirmed the interaction in virus-infected cells using immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunofluorescence assays (IFA). AP3B1 is required by multiple viruses to aid in the replication cycle and therefore may be a therapeutic target. However, we found that the overexpression of AP3B1 suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas the siRNA-mediated depletion of AP3B1 increased the release of infectious virus, suggesting an antiviral role for AP3B1. Together, our findings suggest that AP3B1 is an intrinsic barrier to SARS-CoV-2 replication through interactions with the viral E protein.

        <tr id="The currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant, while causing mild respiratory symptoms, exhibits high transmissibility, drug resistance, and immune evasion. We investigated whether the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 affected the dynamics of fecal microbial composition isolated in culture in moderate COVID-19 patients. Blood, stool, and medical records were collected from 50 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two samples were taken per patient, at disease onset (within 5 days) and after symptom resolution (30–35 days). The part of the gut microbiota identifiable using MALDI-TOF MS was analyzed, and inflammatory cytokines and blood markers were measured in serum. The analysis identified 566 isolates at the species level, including 83 bacterial and 9 fungal species. Our findings indicate a change in the gut microbiota composition isolated in culture during the initial phase of infection, characterized by the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria such as Enterococcus spp. and Citrobacter spp., at the expense of beneficial commensal bacteria from the genus Bacillus and Lactobacillus. Additionally, the enrichment of fungal pathogens in fecal samples collected 30 days after the cessation of disease symptoms might suggest a prolonged disruption of the gut microbiota even after the resolution of COVID-19 symptoms. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence on the systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the importance of considering gastrointestinal involvement in the management and treatment of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="MPOX virus (MPXV), formerly known as monkeypox virus, led to a rapidly evolving pandemic starting May 2022, with over 90,000 cases reported beyond the African continent. This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of IFN-α2a. qPCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-α2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced amounts of viral antigen production and of released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohematogenous route for replication and/or intra-host dissemination.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), characterized by debilitating symptoms like persistent fatigue, cardiovascular symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n=204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). Results: Plasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.">

        <tr id="Purpose. A virus, when it infects a host organism, multiplies its ribonucleic acid (RNA) to make it more harmful. We analyze if a view-based temporal template method, the motion history image (MHI) algorithm, may be of use to extract information on the progression of viral interactions over time. Methods. We employ an alternative online processing modality to comprehend and analyze the replication dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2). The data are evaluated using the computation of a quantitative algorithm, the absolute value of differences (AVD), followed by the generation of temporal template map, the MHI of viral contact. Results. We show that the MHI identifies various stages to examine cultural characteristics and information on the progression of viral interactions over time. The results are more easily obtained compared to a visual inspection of the frames constituting the recordings. MHI also has the advantage of relying on a simple algorithm. The AVD index further provides deeper insights into the dynamics of the viral interaction over time, and its measurement suggests that SARS CoV-2 virus is becoming more widespread. This study shows that the replication process damages the host cell over time, in addition to causing SARS CoV-2 to proliferate. Conclusions. The MHI provides a framework for automated feature extraction from time series data. The combined approach results in decreased computational complexity and enables online assessment of the assay. Clinical and research studies can be conducted to evaluate MHI and AVD and their utility in aiding diagnostic analysis.">

        <tr id="Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis and meningitis are potential central nervous system (CNS) complications following primary VZV infection or reactivation. With Type-I interferon (IFN) signalling being an important first line cellular defence mechanism against VZV infection by the peripheral tissues, we here investigated the triggering of innate immune responses in a human neural-like environment. For this, we established and characterised 5-month matured hiPSC-derived neurospheroids (NSPHs) containing neurons and astrocytes. Subsequently, NSPHs were infected with reporter strains of VZV (VZVeGFP-ORF23) or Sendai virus (SeVeGFP), with the latter serving as an immune-activating positive control. Live cell and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated VZVeGFP-ORF23 infection throughout the NSPHs, while SeVeGFP infection was limited to the outer NSPH border. Next, NanoString digital transcriptomics revealed that SeVeGFP-infected NSPHs activated a clear Type-I IFN response, while this was not the case in VZVeGFP-ORF23-infected NSPHs. Moreover, the latter displayed a strong suppression of genes related to IFN signalling and antigen presentation, as further demonstrated by suppression of IL-6 and CXCL10 production, failure to upregulate Type-I IFN activated anti-viral proteins (Mx1, IFIT2 and ISG15), as well as reduced expression of CD74, a key-protein in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. Finally, even though VZVeGFP-ORF23-infection seems to be immunologically ignored in NSPHs, its presence does result in the formation of stress granules upon long-term infection, as well as disruption of cellular integrity within the infected NSPHs. Concluding, in this study we demonstrate that 5-month matured hiPSC-derived NSPHs display functional innate immune reactivity towards SeV infection, and have the capacity to recapitulate the strong immune evasive behaviour towards VZV.">

        <tr id="In EAE, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, immunization with MOG autoantigen results in the generation of Th1/Th17 T cells in the periphery. MOG-specific T cells then invade into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuronal demyelination. Microglia, innate immune cells in the CNS are known to regulate various neuronal diseases. However, the role of microglia in EAE has remained elusive. BRD4 is a BET protein expressed in microglia, whether BRD4 in microglia contributes to EAE has not been determined. We show that EAE pathology was markedly reduced with microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout (cKO). In these mice, microglia- T cell interactions were greatly reduced, leading to the lack of T cell reactivation. Microglia specific transcriptome data showed downregulation of genes required for interaction with and reactivation of T cells in Brd4 cKO samples. In summary, BRD4 plays a critical role in regulating microglia function in normal and EAE CNS. Summary This study demonstrates that in a EAE model, microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were defective in expressing genes required for microglia- T cells interaction and those involved in neuroinflammation, and demyelination resulting in fewer CNS T cell invasion and display marked reduction in EAE pathology.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants harboring mutations in the structural protein, especially in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein, have raised concern about potential immune escape. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in infection and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies. The mutations that occur in the structural proteins, especially in the spike protein, lead to changes in the virus attributes of transmissibility, an increase in disease severity, a notable reduction in neutralizing antibodies generated and thus a decreased response to vaccines and therapy. The observed multiple mutations in the RBD of the spike protein showed immune escape because it increases the affinity of spike protein binding with the ACE-2 receptor of host cells and increases resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are crucial in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections from the infected tissues and clearing them from circulation. Cytotoxic T cells efficiently recognized the infected cells and killed them by releasing soluble mediator's perforin and granzymes. However, the overwhelming response of T cells and, subsequently, the overproduction of inflammatory mediators during severe infections with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to poor outcomes. This review article summarizes the impact of mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations of RBD, on immunogenicity, immune escape and vaccine-induced immunity, which could contribute to future studies focusing on vaccine design and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 include several comorbidities, but age was the most striking one since elderly people were disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the reasons for this markedly unfavorable response in the elderly, immunosenescence and inflammaging appear as major drivers of this outcome. A finding that was also notable was that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 have an accumulation of senescent T cells, suggesting that immunosenescence may be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present work was designed to examine whether these immunosenescence changes are characteristic of COVID-19 and whether it is dependent on disease severity using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our cross-sectional data show that COVID-19, but not other respiratory infections, rapidly increased cellular senescence and exhaustion in CD4 and CD8 T cells during early infection. In addition, longitudinal analyses with patients from Brazil and Portugal provided evidence of increased frequencies of senescent and exhausted T cells over a 7-d period in patients with mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. Altogether, the study suggests that accelerated immunosenescence in CD4 and especially CD8 T-cell compartments may represent a common and unique outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses replicate in both the cooler, upper portions of the airway and the warmer, lower portions of the respiratory tract. This study investigates how physiological ranges of temperature, specifically 33°C and 37°C, impact host cell biology and how temperature-dependent differences in host cells influence outcomes during influenza A virus infection. This study prioritizes describing mitochondrial networks due to their importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and mediating immune responses to viral infection. The temperature at which cells are incubated significantly influences mitochondrial network morphology and mitochondrial function. Moreover, temperature-dependent changes to mitochondrial networks prior to infection result in temperature-specific changes to host cell outcomes during infection. These findings indicate that mitochondrial structure alone can modulate host cell outcomes during viral infection and that both the form and function of mitochondria directly impact influenza A virus production. While not all mitochondrial processes were shown to be affected by temperature or infection, these results highlight the importance of using physiologically relevant temperatures in respiratory pathogen research and elucidate how mitochondrial dynamics contribute to host cell outcomes during influenza A virus infection. Importance Respiratory viruses infect the upper and lower respiratory tract but rarely is the impact of physiological ranges of temperature (33°C to 37°C) considered. Mitochondria are central mediators of numerous physiological pathways, and their functions are often modified by virus infection. Physiological ranges of temperature can alter mitochondrial form and function, which is further impacted by virus infection. The study sheds light on how temperature can impact mitochondrial form and function in concert with virus infection.">

The editorial comments are based on the review article by Engin et al . The potential role of vitamin D in modulating immune responses has been highlighted by several studies, suggesting that it may influence both the risk and severity of infections. Vitamin D receptors are present in immunocompetent cells, which indicates that vitamin D can potentially modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. This context is relevant in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), where the immune response to the virus can significantly impact the disease progression and outcome. The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D can protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing innate and adaptive immune responses. It also maintains the integrity of the body's physical barriers and modulates inflammatory responses, thereby preventing entry and replication of the virus. Many studies have suggested that adequate vitamin D levels help alleviate morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation has been linked with a lower risk of severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those with a deficiency during seasons with less sunlight exposure.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune dysregulation and SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia have been implicated in fatal COVID-19 disease. However, how these two factors interact to shape disease outcomes is unclear.


METHODS
We carried out viral and immunological phenotyping on a prospective cohort of 280 patients with COVID-19 presenting to acute care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts and Genoa, Italy between June 1, 2020 and February 8, 2022. Disease severity, mortality, plasma viremia, and immune dysregulation were assessed. A mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection was used to analyze the therapeutic potential of Notch4 and pyroptosis inhibition in disease outcome.


RESULTS
Stratifying patients based on %Notch4+ Treg cells and/or the presence of plasma viremia identified four subgroups with different clinical trajectories and immune phenotypes. Patients with both high %Notch4+ Treg cells and viremia suffered the most disease severity and 90-day mortality compared to the other groups even after adjusting for baseline comorbidities. Increased Notch4 and plasma viremia impacted different arms of the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increased Notch4 was associated with decreased Treg cell amphiregulin expression and suppressive function whereas plasma viremia was associated with increased monocyte cell pyroptosis. Combinatorial therapies using Notch4 blockade and pyroptosis inhibition induced stepwise protection against mortality in a mouse model of lethal H1N1 influenza infection.


CONCLUSIONS
The clinical trajectory and survival outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is predicated on two cardinal factors in disease pathogenesis: viremia and Notch4+ Treg cells. Intervention strategies aimed at resetting the immune dysregulation in COVID-19 by antagonizing Notch4 and pyroptosis may be effective in severe cases of viral lung infection.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the critical need to integrate immunomics within the One Health framework to effectively address zoonotic diseases across humans, animals, and environments. Employing advanced high-throughput technologies, this interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex immunological interactions among these systems, enhancing our understanding of immune responses and yielding vital insights into the mechanisms that influence viral spread and host susceptibility. Significant advancements in immunomics have accelerated vaccine development, improved viral mutation tracking, and broadened our comprehension of immune pathways in zoonotic transmissions. This review highlights the role of animals, not merely as carriers or reservoirs, but as essential elements of ecological networks that profoundly influence viral epidemiology. Furthermore, we explore how environmental factors shape immune response patterns across species, influencing viral persistence and spillover risks. Moreover, case studies demonstrating the integration of immunogenomic data within the One Health framework for COVID-19 are discussed, outlining its implications for future research. However, linking humans, animals, and the environment through immunogenomics remains challenging, including the complex management of vast amounts of data and issues of scalability. Despite challenges, integrating immunomics data within the One Health framework significantly enhances our strategies and responses to zoonotic diseases and pandemic threats, marking a crucial direction for future public health breakthroughs.">

In this study, we aimed to investigate the rs2494746 and rs1130214 variants in the AKT1 gene associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.Peripheral blood samples and sociodemographic data from 508 individuals with COVID-19, measuring plasma cytokine concentrations using ELISA and genotyped the AKT1 variants.The rs2494746-C allele was associated with severity, ICU admission, and death from COVID-19. The C allele at rs1130214 was linked to increased TNF and D-dimer levels. Moreover, both variants exhibited an increased cumulative risk of disease severity, ICU admission, and mortality caused by COVID-19. In the predictive analysis, the rs2494746 obtained an accuracy of 71%, suggesting a high probability of the test determining the severity of the disease.Our findings contribute to understanding the influence of the AKT1 gene variants on the immunological damage in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains endemic worldwide ∼5 years since the first documented case. Severe COVID-19 is widely considered to be caused by a dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 within the respiratory tract. Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged 4-6 month old C57BL/6 mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice 4 days post infection and before death were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in the lung and confers protection against mortality. Our preclinical model results do not support targeting CXCL10 therapeutically in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Microglia are key players in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to pathological conditions. Their multifaceted roles in health and disease have garnered significant attention in the context of neurodegeneration. In recent years, single-cell transcriptomic techniques have provided unprecedented insights into microglial heterogeneity, revealing distinct subpopulations and gene expression patterns associated with neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. Here, the transcriptomic landscape of microglia has been dissected by leveraging human single-nuclei RNA sequencing datasets of neurodegenerative conditions, encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and Parkinson’s disease. Results have led to the identification of distinct cell subpopulations, representative of the functional heterogeneity of the brain microglia. Moreover, distinct gene signatures and regulatory networks linked to inflammation and neurodegeneration have been identified. Overall, the study provides an improved portrait of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, and it holds promise for developing a more targeted research aimed at modulating microglial function to mitigate disease progression and foster neuroprotection.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causes post-acute infection syndrome in a surprisingly large number of cases worldwide. This condition, also known as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, is characterized by extremely complex symptoms and pathology. There is a growing consensus that this condition is a consequence of virus-induced immune activation and the inflammatory cascade, with its prolonged duration caused by a persistent virus reservoir.In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response against the spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins, as well as the levels of spike-specific IgG antibodies in 51 healthcare workers, categorized into long COVID or convalescent control groups based on the presence or absence of post-acute symptoms. Additionally, we compared the levels of autoantibodies previously identified during acute or critical COVID-19, including anti-dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO). Furthermore, we analyzed the antibody levels targeting six nuclear antigens within the ENA-6 S panel, as positivity for certain anti-nuclear antibodies has recently been shown to associate not only with acute COVID-19 but also with long COVID. Finally, we examined the frequency of diabetes in both groups. Our investigations were conducted at an average of 18.2 months (convalescent control group) and 23.1 months (long COVID group) after confirmed acute COVID-19 infection, and an average of 21 months after booster vaccination.Our results showed significant differences between the two groups regarding the occurrence of acute infection relative to administering the individual vaccine doses, the frequency of acute symptoms, and the T cell response against all structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A statistical association was observed between the incidence of long COVID symptoms and highly elevated anti-TPO antibodies based on Pearson's chi-squared test. Although patients with long COVID showed moderately elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG serum antibody levels compared to control participants, and further differences were found regarding the positivity for anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, and HbA1c levels between the two groups, these differences were not statistically significant.This study highlights the need for close monitoring of long COVID development in patients with elevated anti-TPO titers, which can be indicated by strongly elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response and moderately raised anti-spike IgG levels even long after the acute infection. However, our results do not exclude the possibility of new-onset thyroid autoimmunity after COVID-19, and further investigations are required to clarify the etiological link between highly elevated anti-TPO titers and long COVID.">

        <tr id="We previously demonstrated that the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients were filled with a clear hydrogel consisting of hyaluronan (HA). In this translational study, we investigated the role of HA at all stages of COVID-19 disease to map the consequences of elevated HA on morbidity and identify the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced HA production. A reduced alveolar surface area was observed in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, as visualized by a 3D rendering of lung morphology using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. We confirmed the presence of HA in lung biopsies and found large quantities of proinflammatory fragmented HA. The association of systemic HA in blood plasma and disease severity was assessed in patients with mild (WHO Clinical Progression Scale, WHO-CPS, 1-5) and severe COVID-19 (WHO-CPS, 6-9) during the acute and convalescent phases and related to lung function. We found that systemic levels of HA were high during acute COVID-19 disease, remained elevated during convalescence, and were associated with a reduced diffusion capacity. In vitro 3D-lung models, differentiated from primary human bronchial epithelial cells, were used to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HA metabolism, and transcriptomic analyses revealed a dysregulation of HA synthases and hyaluronidases, both contributing to increased HA in apical secretions. Furthermore, corticosteroid treatment reduced the inflammation and downregulated HA synthases. Our findings demonstrate that HA plays a role in COVID-19 morbidity and that sustained elevated HA concentrations may contribute to long-term respiratory impairment.IMPORTANCEThis study provides insights into the role of hyaluronan (HA) in the severity and long-term impact of COVID-19 on lung function. Through extensive morphological examination of lung tissues and a multicenter study, we identified that HA levels are significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with a reduced lung diffusion capacity during convalescence. Using a 3D-lung model, we further uncovered how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a dysregulated HA metabolism, leading to increased HA production. Our findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting HA metabolism could offer new therapeutic avenues for managing COVID-19, particularly to prevent long-term lung impairment. Additionally, HA holds potential as a biomarker for predicting disease severity, which could guide personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Neutrophilia occurs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and is predictive of poor outcomes. Here, we link heterogenous neutrophil populations to disease severity in COVID-19. We identified neutrophils with features of cellular aging and immunosuppressive capacity in mild COVID-19 and features of neutrophil immaturity and activation in severe disease. The low-density neutrophil (LDN) number in circulating blood correlated with COVID-19 severity. Many of the divergent neutrophil phenotypes in COVID-19 were overrepresented in the LDN fraction and were less detectable in normal-density neutrophils. Functionally, neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed defects in neutrophil extracellular trap formation and reactive oxygen species production. Soluble factors secreted by neutrophils from these patients inhibited T cell proliferation. Neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19 had increased expression of arginase-1 protein, a feature that was retained in convalescent patients. Despite this increase in intracellular expression, there was a reduction in arginase-1 release by neutrophils into serum and culture supernatants. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated T cell suppression was independent of arginase-1. Our results indicate the presence of dysfunctional, activated, and immature neutrophils in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. These data will enable further mechanistic studies of the contribution of the airway epithelium to initial host responses and represent a powerful new resource for investigators.">

        <tr id="Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are at increased risk of bacterial and fungal secondary pulmonary infections due to acquired immune dysfunction. Given that the activity of neutrophils has not been described in these patients, we aimed to investigate the function of neutrophils at ICU admission and on Day 7 (D7) post admission. Neutrophil maturation and several functional indicators were investigated. We detected a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species production at D7, but we did not observe any other significant alterations in neutrophil function. Furthermore, bronchoalveolar lavage obtained from patients displayed no inhibitory effect on the function of neutrophils from healthy donors. These findings indicate that patients admitted to the ICU for SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS do not acquire neutrophil dysfunction within the first week of their stay, which suggests that nosocomial infections among these patients are not due to acquired neutrophil dysfunctions.">

        <tr id="mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines have played a critical role in reducing severe outcomes of COVID-19. Humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination have been extensively studied in blood; however, limited information is available on the presence and duration of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in saliva and other mucosal fluids. Saliva offers a non-invasive sampling method that may also provide a better understanding of mucosal immunity at sites where the virus enters the body. Our objective was to evaluate the salivary immune response after vaccination with the COVID-19 Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. Two hundred three staff members of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were enrolled prior to receiving their first dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Participants were asked to self-collect 6 saliva specimens at days 0 (prior to first dose), 14, 28 (prior to second dose), 42, and 56 using a SalivaBio saliva collection device. Saliva specimens were tested for anti-spike protein SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG enzyme immunoassays. Overall, SARS-CoV-2-specific salivary IgA titers peaked 2 weeks after each vaccine dose, followed by a sharp decrease during the following weeks. In contrast to IgA titers, IgG antibody titers increased substantially 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose, peaked 2 weeks after the second dose and persisted at an elevated level until at least 8 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Additionally, no significant differences in IgA/IgG titers were observed based on age, sex, or race/ethnicity. All participants mounted salivary IgA and IgG immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 after receiving the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. Because of the limited follow-up time for this study, more data are needed to assess the antibody levels beyond 2 months after the first dose. Our results confirm the potential utility of saliva in assessing immune responses elicited by immunization and possibly by infection.">

        <tr id="The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), often preceded by acute lung injury (ALI), is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory fluid in the lung alveoli, leaky alveolar epithelium and endothelium, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This progression from ALI to ARDS is a major contributor to the high mortality observed in COVID-19 patients. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to lung ACE2 and, in addition to facilitating viral cell entry, it plays an important role in the development of ALI and ARDS, especially in the later phases of COVID-19 as well as long COVID. Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 4A3 is a key mediator of ARDS pathology. This study tested the hypothesis that targeting PTP4A3 would prevent COVID-19 associated ALI. Intratracheal administration of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Subunit 1 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 elicited pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leaky alveoli, overexpression of cytokines, structural lung injury and lung dysfunction; all these symptoms were ameliorated by the selective, allosteric inhibitor of PTP4A3, KVX-053. These findings provide the first evidence supporting a role for PTP4A3 in the development of SARS-CoV-2- mediated ALI. Significance Statement This study tested the hypothesis that targeting PTP4A3 would prevent COVID-19 associated ALI/ARDS.

CD8+ T cells are abundant within MS lesions, but their potential role in disease pathology remains unclear. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the cotwin had either no or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease. Proinflammatory features of CD8+ T cells in multiple sclerosis may serve as potential therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages. Editor’s summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the nervous system in which CD8 T cells are present in MS lesions, but their role in disease progression remains unclear. Kavaka et al. analyzed CD8 T cells from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of monozygotic twins, where one twin had MS and the other showed no signs or subclinical signs of neuroinflammation (SCNI). CD8 T cells from individuals with MS and cotwins with SCNI exhibited proinflammatory immunological and metabolic features consistent with enhanced activation and migration. These findings were validated in a separate cohort of individuals with MS, providing insights into the role of CD8 T cells in MS progression. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="In the spring of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented a formidable challenge to national and global healthcare systems. Immunocompromised individuals or those with relevant pre-existing conditions were particularly at risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thus, understanding the immunological processes in these patient groups is crucial for current research. This study aimed to investigate humoral immunity following vaccination and infection in liver transplant recipients. Humoral immunity analysis involved measuring IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (anti-S IgG) and employing a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) for assessing the hACE2 receptor-binding inhibitory capacity of antibodies. The study revealed that humoral immunity post-vaccination is well established, with positive results for anti-S IgG in 92.9% of the total study cohort. Vaccinated and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients exhibited significantly higher anti-S IgG levels compared to vaccinated, non-infected patients (18,590 AU/mL vs. 2320 AU/mL, p < 0.001). Additionally, a significantly elevated receptor-binding inhibitory capacity was observed in the cPassTMTM sVNT (96.4% vs. 91.8%, p = 0.004). Furthermore, a substantial enhancement of anti-S IgG levels (p = 0.034) and receptor-binding inhibition capacity (p < 0.001) was observed with an increasing interval post-transplantation (up to 30 years), calculated by generalized linear model analysis. In summary, fully vaccinated liver transplant recipients exhibit robust humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2, which significantly intensifies following infection and with increasing time after transplantation. These findings should be considered for booster vaccination schemes for liver transplant recipients.">

        <tr id="Obesity induces diverse changes in host immunity, resulting in worse disease outcomes following infection with various pathogens, including arthritogenic alphaviruses. However, the impact of obesity on the functional landscape of immune cells during arthritogenic alphavirus infection remains unexplored. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the blood and tissue immune responses to Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection in lean and obese mice. Footpad injection of MAYV caused significant shifts in immune cell populations and induced robust expression of interferon response and proinflammatory cytokine genes and related pathways in both blood and tissue. In MAYV-infected lean mice, analysis of the local tissue response revealed a unique macrophage subset with high expression of IFN response genes that was not found in obese mice. This was associated with less severe inflammation in lean mice. These results provide evidence for a unique macrophage population that may contribute to the superior capacity of lean mice to control arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Graphical abstract Highlights Obesity worsens disease outcomes following arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Arthritogenic alphavirus infection causes significant shifts in immune cell populations in the blood and footpad. Blood monocytes from lean mice had higher expression of interferon response genes at the later stage of infection. Footpads in lean mice have an expanded population of F4/80lo macrophages with an intense interferon response gene signature before and after alphavirus infection that is not found in obese mice. Macrophages in obese mice express lower levels of interferon response genes, have a unique necroptosis signature, and higher F4/80 expression.">

This study aimed to identify potentially immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides and to explore the intricate host–pathogen interactions involving peripheral immune responses, memory profiles, and various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Using in silico and experimental methods, we identified several CD8-restricted SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are either poorly studied or have previously unreported immunogenicity: fifteen from the Spike and three each from non-structural proteins Nsp1-2-3-16. A Spike peptide, LA-9, demonstrated a 57% response rate in ELISpot assays using PBMCs from 14 HLA-A*02:01 positive, vaccinated, and mild-COVID-19 recovered subjects, indicating its potential for diagnostics, research, and multi-epitope vaccine platforms. We also found that younger individuals, with fewer vaccine doses and longer intervals since infection, showed lower anti-Spike (ELISA) and anti-Wuhan neutralizing antibodies (pseudovirus assay), higher naïve T cells, and lower central memory, effector memory, and CD4hiCD8low T cells (flow cytometry) compared to older subjects. In our cohort, a higher prevalence of Vδ2-γδ and DN T cells, and fewer naïve CD8 T cells, seemed to correlate with strong cellular and lower anti-NP antibody responses and to associate with Omicron infection, absence of confusional state, and habitual sporting activity.">

        <tr id="Introduction A clear immune correlate of protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has not been defined. We explored antibody, B-cell, and T-cell responses to the third-dose vaccine and relationship to incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Adults in a prospective cohort provided blood samples at day 0, day 14, and 10 months after the third-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Participants self-reported incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma anti–SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and spike-subunit-1 and spike-subunit-2 antibodies were measured. A sub-study assessed SARS-CoV-2–specific plasma and memory B-cell and memory T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by enzyme-linked immunospot. Comparative analysis between participants who developed incident infection and uninfected participants utilised non-parametric t-tests, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard ratios. Results Of the 132 participants, 47 (36%) reported incident SARS-CoV-2 infection at a median 16.5 (16.25–21) weeks after the third-dose vaccination. RBD titres and B-cell responses, but not T-cell responses, increased after the third-dose vaccine. Whereas no significant difference in day 14 antibody titres or T-cell responses was observed between participants with and without incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, RBD memory B-cell frequencies were significantly higher in those who did not develop infection [10.0% (4.5%–16.0%) versus 4.9% (1.6%–9.3%), p = 0.01]. RBD titres and memory B-cell frequencies remained significantly higher at 10 months than day 0 levels (p < 0.01). Discussion Robust antibody and B-cell responses persisted at 10 months following the third-dose vaccination. Higher memory B-cell frequencies, rather than antibody titres or T-cell responses, predicted protection from subsequent infection, identifying memory B cells as a correlate of protection.">

        <tr id="Severe viral pneumonia can induce rapid expansion of KRT5+ basal-like cells in small airways and alveoli; this forms a scar-like structure that persists in the injured alveoli and impedes normal alveolar epithelium regeneration. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which viral infection induced this remodeling response. Through comparing different lung-injury models, we demonstrated that infection induced strong IFN-γ signal–stimulated dysplastic KRT5+ cell formation. Inactivation of interferon receptor 1 (Ifngr1) reduced dysplastic cell formation, ameliorated lung fibrosis, and improved lung-function recovery. Mechanistically, IFN-γ regulated dysplastic cell formation via the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) pathway. Inhibiting FAK/Src diminished IFN-γ–induced YAP nuclear translocation and dysplastic cell formation. Inhibiting YAP during viral infection prevented dysplastic cell formation, whereas inhibiting YAP in persistent KRT5+ cells led to their conversion into distal club cells. Importantly, human dysplastic cells exhibited elevated FAK and YAP activity, and IFN-γ treatment promoted the transformation of human alveolar progenitor cells into dysplastic cells. These findings uncover the role of infection-induced inflammatory response in alveolar remodeling and may provide potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of alveolar remodeling in patients with severe viral pneumonia.">

        <tr id="Host immunity is central to the virus's spread dynamics, which is significantly influenced by vaccination and prior infection experiences. In this work, we analyzed the co-evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mutation, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses across various variants in 822 human and mice vaccinated with different non-Omicron and Omicron vaccines is analyzed. The link between vaccine efficacy and vaccine type, dosing, and post-vaccination duration is revealed. The classification of immune protection against non-Omicron and Omicron variants is co-evolved with genetic mutations and vaccination. Additionally, a model, the Prevalence Score (P-Score) is introduced, which surpasses previous algorithm-based models in predicting the potential prevalence of new variants in vaccinated populations. The hybrid vaccination combining the wild-type (WT) inactivated vaccine with the Omicron BA.4/5 mRNA vaccine may provide broad protection against both non-Omicron variants and Omicron variants, albeit with EG.5.1 still posing a risk. In conclusion, these findings enhance understanding of population immunity variations and provide valuable insights for future vaccine development and public health strategies.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism and mechanisms implicated in cardiac damage in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was completely restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible. Author Summary Mosquito-borne viruses, such as those within the alphavirus genus, are an ongoing concern to human health globally. While we have recently begun to explore the mechanisms of CHIKV-induced pathology in the heart, little is known about other arboviruses and alphaviruses related to CHIKV. Here, we identified that multiple cardiac cell types are susceptible to infection by several arboviruses important to public health. Specifically, we noted differences in how two related viruses, CHIKV and MAYV, infect endothelial cells from multiple origins. This work highlights the potential for other emerging arboviruses, in addition to CHIKV, to directly infect cardiac tissue. Moreover, it emphasizes the ability for MAYV, an emerging virus that is less studied, to infect various endothelial cell types to high titers, suggesting the need for further research on MAYV pathogenesis. Finally, this research identifies differences in infection between individual strains of CHIKV, suggesting a finely tuned mechanism of restriction in endothelial cells that can be further explored, as well as the need to study use different viral strains for future alphavirus research.">

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has been a global health concern since 2007. It primarily causes fetal microcephaly and neuronal defects through maternal transmission and induces neurological complications in adults. Recent studies report elevated proinflammatory cytokines and persistent neurological alterations post recovery, but the in vivo mechanisms remain unclear. In our study, viral RNA loads in the brains of mice infected with ZIKV peaked at 7 days post infection and returned to baseline by day 21, indicating recovery. RNA sequencing of the cerebral cortex at 7 and 21 days revealed upregulated genes related to neuroinflammation and microglial activation. Histological analyses indicated neuronal cell death and altered neurite morphology owing to severe neuroinflammation. Additionally, sustained microglial activation was associated with increased phospho-Tau levels, constituting a marker of neurodegeneration. These findings highlight how persistent microglial activation leads to neuronal dysfunction post ZIKV recovery, providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced brain abnormalities.">

        <tr id="Long COVID is a complex condition where symptoms persist for more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and affects an estimated 5-30% of individuals. While the pathobiology of long COVID is still evolving, persistent inflammation has emerged as an important feature of this condition. However, it is unclear if immune responses from COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 re-infection exacerbate or mirror the initial inflammatory responses. To address this question, we quantified 182 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins in plasma using multiplexed affinity proteomics. Plasma samples were collected 6-9 months after first infection, but before COVID-19 vaccination from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (n=21) or from individuals with long COVID (n=12). This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure.">

        <tr id="Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare and severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). While the exact disease mechanism remains unknown, previous studies suggest that mutant GFAP influences many cellular processes, including cytoskeleton stability, mechanosensing, metabolism, and proteasome function. While most studies have primarily focused on GFAP-expressing astrocytes, GFAP is also expressed by radial glia and neural progenitor cells, prompting questions about the impact of GFAP mutations on central nervous system (CNS) development. In this study, we observed impaired differentiation of astrocytes and neurons in co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons, as well as in neural organoids, both generated from AxD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with a GFAPR239C mutation. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified distinct cell populations and transcriptomic differences between the mutant GFAP cultures and a corrected isogenic control. These findings were supported by results obtained with immunocytochemistry and proteomics. In co-cultures, the GFAPR239C mutation resulted in an increased abundance of immature cells, while in unguided neural organoids and cortical organoids, we observed altered lineage commitment and reduced abundance of astrocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed increased stress susceptibility, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and altered extracellular matrix and cell-cell communication patterns in the AxD cultures, which also exhibited higher cell death after stress. Overall, our results point to altered cell differentiation in AxD patient-derived iPS-cell models, opening new avenues for AxD research.">

They include a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of smell (anosmia), and neurological–cognitive sequelae, such as memory loss, anxiety, brain fog, acute encephalitis, and stroke, collectively called long neuro-COVID-19 (long neuro-COVID). They also include cardiopulmonary sequelae, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary damage, fibrosis, gastrointestinal dysregulation, renal failure, and vascular endothelial dysregulation, and the onset of new diabetes, with each symptom usually being treated individually. The main unmet challenge is to understand the mechanisms of the pathophysiologic sequelae, in particular the neurological symptoms. This mini-review presents the main mechanistic hypotheses considered to explain the multiple long neuro-COVID symptoms, namely immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation, persistent viral reservoirs, vascular and endothelial dysfunction, and the disruption of the neurotransmitter signaling along various paths. We suggest that the nucleoprotein N of SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a “hub” between the virus and the host inflammation, immunity, and neurotransmission.">

        <tr id="Immunocompromised people are at high risk of prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and progression to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the efficacy of late-onset direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy with therapeutics in clinical use and experimental drugs to mitigate persistent viral replication is unclear. In this study, we employed an immunocompromised mouse model, which supports prolonged replication of SARS-CoV-2 to explore late-onset treatment options. Tandem immuno-depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) beta B.1.351 resulted in prolonged infection with virus replication for 5 weeks after inoculation. Early-onset treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (paxlovid) or molnupiravir was only moderately efficacious, whereas the experimental therapeutic 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU, EIDD-2749) significantly reduced virus load in the upper and lower respiratory compartments 4 days postinfection (dpi). All antivirals significantly lowered virus burden in a 7-day treatment regimen initiated 14 dpi, but paxlovid-treated animals experienced rebound virus replication in the upper respiratory tract 7 days after treatment end. Viral RNA was detectable 28 dpi in paxlovid-treated animals, albeit not in the molnupiravir or 4'-FlU groups, when treatment was initiated 14 dpi and continued for 14 days. Low-level virus replication continued 35 dpi in animals receiving vehicle but had ceased in all treatment groups. These data indicate that late-onset DAA therapy significantly shortens the duration of persistent virus replication in an immunocompromised host, which may have implications for clinical use of antiviral therapeutics to alleviate the risk of progression to severe disease in highly vulnerable patients.


IMPORTANCE
Four years after the onset of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the immunocompromised are at greatest risk of developing life-threatening severe disease. However, specific treatment plans for this most vulnerable patient group have not yet been developed. Employing a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-depleted immunocompromised mouse model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we explored therapeutic options of persistent infections with standard-of-care paxlovid, molnupiravir, and the experimental therapeutic 4'-fluorouridine (4'-FlU). Late-onset treatment initiated 14 days after infection was efficacious, but only 4'-FlU was rapidly sterilizing. No treatment-experienced viral variants with reduced susceptibility to the drugs emerged, albeit virus replication rebounded in animals of the paxlovid group after treatment end. This study supports the use of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for late-onset management of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised hosts. However, treatment courses likely require to be extended for maximal therapeutic benefit, calling for appropriately powered clinical trials to meet the specific needs of this patient group.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells - a process termed “microglia replacement.” To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this system’s power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Microbiome perturbations can have long-term effects on health. The dynamics of the gut microbiome and virome in women living with HIV (WLHIV) and their newborn infants is poorly understood. Here, we performed metagenomic sequencing analyses on longitudinal stool samples including 23 mothers (13 WLHIV, 10 HIV-negative) and 12 infants that experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild disease, as well as 40 mothers (18 WLHIV, 22 HIV-negative) and 60 infants that remained SARS-CoV-2 seronegative throughout the study follow-up. Regardless of HIV or SARS-CoV-2 status, maternal bacterial and viral profiles were distinct from infants. Using linear mixed effects models, we showed that the microbiome alpha diversity trajectory was not significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and seronegative women. However, seropositive women’s positive trajectory while uninfected was abruptly reversed after SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.015). Gut virome signatures of women were not associated with SARS-CoV-2. Alterations in infant microbiome and virome diversities were generally not impacted by SARS-CoV-2 but were rather driven by development. We did not find statistically significant interactions between HIV and SARS-CoV-2 on the gut microbiome and virome. Overall, our study provides insights into the complex interplay between maternal and infant bacterial microbiome, virome, and the influence of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV status.">

        <tr id="The identification of specific markers for microglia has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, markers such as P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls have been proposed as microglia-specific and widely used to explore microglial functions within various central nervous system (CNS) contexts. The specificity of these markers was based on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures even after infiltrating the CNS. However, recent findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes can adopt microglia-like characteristics while maintaining a pro-inflammatory profile upon permanent engraftment in the CNS.In this study, we utilize bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that engrafted monocytes acquire expression of established microglia markers—P2ry12, TMEM119, Fcrls—and the pan-myeloid marker Iba1, which has been commonly mischaracterized as microglia-specific. These changes are accompanied by alterations in chromatin accessibility and shifts in chromatin binding motifs that are indicative of microglial identity. Moreover, we show that engrafted monocytes dynamically regulate the expression of CX3CR1, CCR2, Ly6C, and transcription factors PU.1, CTCF, RUNX, AP-1, CEBP, and IRF2, all of which are crucial for shaping microglial identity. This study is the first to illustrate that engrafted monocytes in the retina undergo both epigenetic and transcriptional changes, enabling them to express microglia-like signatures. These findings highlight the need for future research to account for these changes when assessing the roles of monocytes and microglia in CNS pathology. Significance Statement Monocytes can express putative microglia markers P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls upon engraftment into the retina. Given their involvement in neuroinflammation, it is crucial to consider this overlap when utilizing these markers for experimental analysis.">

        <tr id="Immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the demands associated with immune responses. The effects of aging on these pathways and on the metabolic phenotype of the immune cells participating in antibody responses to vaccines are still largely unknown. Here we used a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 that utilizes the cellular heat shock chaperone glycoprotein 96 (gp96), engineered to co-express SARS-CoV-2 Spike (spike) protein (gp96-Ig-S). Results show that this vaccine induces comparable B cell primary responses in young and old mice at later time points, but a significantly lesser secondary response in old as compared to young mice, with the antibodies generated in the secondary response being also of lower avidity. This occurs because aging changes the B cell metabolic phenotype and induces hyper-metabolic B cells that are associated with higher intrinsic inflammation and decreased protective antibody responses. However, the gp96-Ig-S vaccine was found to be effective in significantly reducing the metabolic/inflammatory status of B cells from old mice, suggesting the possibility that targeting metabolic pathways may improve immune function in old mice that do not respond adequately to the vaccine.">

        <tr id="With circulation of SARS-CoV-2, fears about coinfection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV were significant, but the opposite was observed. Distancing/barriers played a major role in reducing other viral co-infections, however, some infrequent co-infections still occurred. We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RSV during coinfection to understand how they might compete or synergize. We found only RSV’s replication was significantly reduced when coinfected with SARS-CoV-2. Investigation of the mechanism revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp1 disrupts the RSV M2-2 protein but not the upstream M2-1 protein on the same biscistronic mRNA transcript. The impact of Nsp1 on M2-2 was not dependent on M2-2 being the second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA transcript, but likely from prevention of ribosomal termination-reinitiation necessary for M2-2 production. Additional viral ORFs from influenza A, influenza B, or Sendai virus dependent on the same or other ribosomal initiation mechanisms were tested and we found only influenza B M/M2 which likely uses a similar method as M2-2 was disrupted. Various M2-2 constructs, with/without the proposed site of ribosomal termination-reinitiating, co-transfected with Nsp1 and were in agreement that disruption to M2-2 expression occurs if the site of re-initiation was present upstream. These data not only suggest Sars-CoV-2 can outcompete RSV through suppression of M2, but may also point to potential ways to interfere with RSV by targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, particularly causes severe inflammatory disease in elderly, obese, and male patients. Since both aging and obesity are associated with decreased testosterone and estradiol expression, we hypothesized that decreased hormone levels contribute to excessive inflammation in the context of COVID-19. Previously, we and others have shown that hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 patients is induced by the production of pathogenic anti-spike IgG antibodies that activate alveolar macrophages. Therefore, we developed an in vitro assay in which we stimulated human macrophages with viral stimuli, anti-spike IgG immune complexes, and different sex hormones. Treatment with levels of testosterone reflecting young adults led to a significant reduction in TNF and IFN-γ production by human macrophages. In addition, estradiol significantly attenuated the production of a very broad panel of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ. Both testosterone and estradiol reduced the expression of Fc gamma receptors IIa and III, the two main receptors responsible for anti-spike IgG-induced inflammation. Combined, these findings indicate that sex hormones reduce the inflammatory response of human alveolar macrophages to specific COVID-19-associated stimuli, thereby providing a potential immunological mechanism for the development of severe COVID-19 in both older male and female patients.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: The study aims to explore the potential for transplacental transmission of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on its pathophysiology, placental defense mechanisms, and the clinical implications for maternal and neonatal health. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive review of the current literature was conducted, analyzing studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, the expression of key viral receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in placental cells, and the immune responses involved in placental defense. The review also examined the clinical outcomes related to maternal and neonatal health, including adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. Results: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the placenta supports the biological plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 transplacental transmission. Histopathological findings from the infected placentas reveal inflammation, vascular changes, and the evidence of viral particles in placental tissues. Clinical reports indicate an increased risk of preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and neonatal infection in pregnancies affected by COVID-19. However, the frequency and mechanisms of vertical transmission remain variable across studies, highlighting the need for standardized research protocols. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can potentially infect placental cells, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes and neonatal infection. While evidence of transplacental transmission has been documented, the risk and mechanisms are not fully understood. Ongoing research is essential to clarify these aspects and inform obstetric care practices to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in vaccination and therapies for coronavirus disease, challenges remain due to reduced antibody longevity and the emergence of virulent variants like Omicron (BA.1) and its subvariants (BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.5). This study explored the potential of adoptive immunotherapy and harnessing the protective abilities using virus-specific T cells (VSTs). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VSTs were generated by stimulating donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells with spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane protein peptide mixtures. Phenotypic characterization, including T-cell receptor (TCR) vβ and pentamer analyses, was performed on the ex vivo-expanded cells. We infected human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-partially matched human Calu-3 cells with various authentic SARS-CoV-2 strains in a Biosafety Level 3 facility and co-cultured them with VSTs. VSTs exhibited a diverse TCR vβ repertoire, confirming their ability to target a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens from both the ancestral and mutant strains, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.5. These ex vivo-expanded cells exhibited robust cytotoxicity and low alloreactivity against HLA-partially matched SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Their cytotoxic effects were consistent across variants, targeting conserved spike and nucleocapsid epitopes. Our findings suggest that third-party partial HLA-matching VSTs could counter immune-escape mechanisms posed by emerging variants of concern.">

        <tr id="Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes a persistent infection in sensory ganglia. The infection manifests itself as genital herpes but in rare cases it can cause meningitis. In this study, we used a murine model of HSV-2 meningitis to show that Fas and FasL are induced within the CNS upon HSV-2 infection, both on resident microglia and astrocytes and on infiltrating monocytes and lymphocytes. Mice lacking Fas or FasL had a more severe disease development with significantly higher morbidity, mortality, and an overall higher CNS viral load. In parallel, these Fas/FasL-deficient mice showed a severely impaired infection-induced CNS inflammatory response with lower levels of infiltrating CD4+ T-cells, lower levels of Th1 cytokines and chemokines, and a shift in the balance between M1 and M2 microglia/monocytes. In vitro, we confirmed that Fas and FasL is required for the induction of leucocyte apoptosis, but also show that the Fas/FasL pathway is required for adequate cytokine and chemokine production by glial cells. In summary, our data show that the Fas/FasL cell death receptor pathway is an important defense mechanism in the spinal cord as it down-regulates HSV-2-induced inflammation while at the same time promoting adequate anti-viral immune responses against infection.">

Mtb infected and multiplied in all cell types with HIV-1 increasing entry to astrocytes and pericytes, and growth in HIV-1 positive pericytes and endothelial cells. The permeability of the BBB increased resulting in translocation of bacilli across it. Cytopathic effects included increased markers of cellular stress, ROS release, the induction of neurotoxic astrocytes, and increased secretion of neuroexcitotoxic glutamate. Distinct cell-type specific production of inflammatory and effector mediators were observed. These data indicate Mtb can translocate the BBB directly to initiate meningitis.">

        <tr id="The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and enduring impact, resulting in substantial loss of life. The scientific community has responded unprecedentedly by investigating various aspects of the crisis, particularly focusing on the acute phase of COVID-19. The roles of the viral load, cytokines, and chemokines during the acute phase and in the context of patients who experienced enduring symptoms upon infection, so called Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 or PASC, have been studied extensively. Here, in this review, we offer a virologist’s perspective on PASC, highlighting the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, cytokines, and chemokines in different organs of patients across the full clinical spectrum of acute-phase disease. We underline that the probability of severe or critical disease progression correlates with increased viral load levels detected in the upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), and plasma. Acute-phase viremia is a clear, although not unambiguous, predictor of PASC development. Moreover, both the quantity and diversity of functions of cytokines and chemokines increase with acute-phase disease severity. Specific cytokines remain or become elevated in the PASC phase, although the driving factor of ongoing inflammation found in patients with PASC remains to be investigated. The key findings highlighted in this review contribute to a further understanding of PASC and their differences and overlap with acute disease.">

Given that circulatory proteins can enter the brain, we asked whether microglia are responsive to such proteins. Here, we identify a stable population of microglia specialized to take up circulatory proteins in a region-specific manner under physiological conditions; human hematopoietic stem cell-derived microglia replacing endogenous microglia in chimeric mice show similar regional specialization. Plasma-positive microglia are characterized by prominent expression of genes related to innate immunity and antigen presentation and exhibit high metabolic and phagocytic activity. This activity is dependent, in part, on microglial uptake and accumulation of circulatory Apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I). Our findings thus identify a new model of communication between brain and periphery through specialized microglia.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Objectives Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse neonatal outcome, primarily preterm birth and stillbirth. Our study aimed to investigate to which extent SARS-CoV-2 affects placental tissue and if viral replication within the placenta is evident, thus if there is a correlation between placental damage and adverse pregnancy outcome such as stillbirth. Methods We prospectively collected placentas from 61 SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women and 10 controls. Histopathological, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization studies were performed on all placentas with antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 proteins, ACE2, various immune cells, and inflammatory markers or probes for SARS-CoV-2 genes and an antisense strand. Results The measured scores of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, and antisense strand indicating replication correlated with both the severity of maternal symptoms and presence of stillbirth. Specifically, 15/61 placentas exhibited replication, while the three cases with stillbirth had high or maximal replication scores. ACE2-H-score was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients, while the expression of various immune cells did not differ statistically. In multivariate analysis, presence of maternal comorbidities correlated with presence of severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion We report evidence of active in vivo SARS-CoV-2 replication in the placenta after maternal infection in pregnancy in a case–control setting in a large population. Intensity of placental viral replication as well as viral levels were higher in women with severe or critical COVID-19 disease, supporting the rationale that severity of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection could correlate with the severity of placentitis. Replication was maximal in cases of stillbirth, which suggests direct placental involvement in the pathophysiology of this dramatic outcome. Continuing to advocate for preventive measures against COVID-19 during pregnancy, including (re)vaccination, as well as appropriately counseling women with diagnosed infection, are of utter importance.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence points to the microbial exposome as a critical factor in maturing and shaping the host immune system, thereby influencing responses to immune challenges such as infections or vaccines. To investigate the effect of early-life viral exposures on immune development and vaccine responses, we inoculated mice with six distinct viral pathogens in sequence beginning in the neonatal period, and then evaluated their immune signatures before and after intramuscular or intranasal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Sequential viral infection drove profound changes in all aspects of the immune system, including increasing circulating leukocytes, altering innate and adaptive immune cell lineages in tissues, and markedly influencing serum cytokine and total antibody levels. Beyond changes in the immune responses, these exposures also modulated the composition of the endogenous intestinal microbiota. Although sequentially-infected mice exhibited increased systemic immune activation and T cell responses after intramuscular and intranasal SARS-CoV-2 immunization, we observed decreased vaccine-induced antibody responses in these animals. These results suggest that early-life viral exposures are sufficient to diminish antibody responses to vaccination in mice, and highlight the potential importance of considering prior microbial exposures when investigating vaccine responses.">

        <tr id="Background Limited data are available describing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections on the plasma proteome. Methods PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients, enrolled in a natural history study, underwent analysis of the plasma proteome. A prospective cohort of 66 unvaccinated and 24 vaccinated persons with different degrees of infection severity were evaluated acutely (within 40 days of symptom onset), and at three and ten months. Comparisons based on vaccination status alone and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were performed. A second cohort of vaccinated Omicron patients were evaluated acutely and at ten months. Results Acutely, unvaccinated patients manifested overexpression of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory responses, while vaccinated patients exhibited adaptive immune responses without significant inflammation. At three and ten months, only unvaccinated patients had diminished but sustained inflammatory (C3b, CCL15, IL17RE) and immune responses (DEFA5,TREM1). Both groups had underexpression of pathways essential for cellular function, signaling, and angiogenesis (AKT1, MAPK14, HSPB1) across phases. Unsupervised clustering, based on protein expression, identified four groups of patients with variable vaccination rates demonstrating that additional clinical factors influence the plasma proteome. The proteome of vaccinated Omicron patients did not differ from vaccinated pre-Omicron patients. Conclusions Vaccination attenuates the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection across phases. However, at ten months after symptom onset, changes in the plasma proteome persist in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, which may be relevant to post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections associated with post-acute infection syndromes.">

Here we report that synapse engulfing microglia in the thalamus are crucial for cognitive impairment after cortical brain injury. Region-specific manipulations of reactive microglia in the chronic phase of injuries showed that microglial changes in the thalamus, but not in the hippocampus, impaired recognition memory. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the enrichment of synapse engulfing microglia in the thalamus, which developed in a CD9-dependent manner and caused synaptic loss and recognition memory deficits. In the thalamus, the blood-brain barrier was disrupted, and extravasated γ-immunoglobulins (IgG) co-localized with synapse engulfing microglia. Fcγ receptor III blockade in the thalamus reduced synapse engulfing microglia, synapse loss, and recognition memory deficits. These findings demonstrate that the induction of synapse engulfing microglia in the thalamus by extravasated IgG/FcγRIII and CD9 signals causes recognition memory deficits after cortical brain injury.">

        <tr id="Although the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily manifests as severe respiratory distress, its impact on the cardiovascular system is also notable. Studies reveal that COVID-19 patients often suffer from certain vascular diseases, partly attributed to increased proliferation or altered phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although the association between COVID-19 and VSMCs is recognized, the precise mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2's influence on VSMC phenotype remains largely under-reviewed. In this context, while there is a consistent body of literature dissecting the effect of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, few reports delve into the potential role of VSMC switching in the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 and the molecular mechanisms involved therein. This review dissects and critiques the link between COVID-19 and VSMCs, with particular attention to pathways involving cholesterol, calcium, and phosphate. These pathways underpin the interaction between the virus and VSMCs. Such interaction promotes VSMC proliferation, and eventually potentiates vascular calcification as well as worsens prognosis in patients with COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Mitochondria play pivotal roles in sustaining various biological functions including energy metabolism, cellular signaling transduction, and innate immune responses. Viruses exploit cellular metabolic synthesis to facilitate viral replication, potentially disrupting mitochondrial functions and subsequently eliciting a cascade of proinflammatory responses in host cells. Additionally, the disruption of mitochondrial membranes is involved in immune regulation. During viral infections, mitochondria orchestrate innate immune responses through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of mitochondrial DNA, which serves as an effective defense mechanism against virus invasion. The targeting of mitochondrial damage may represent a novel approach to antiviral intervention. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanism underlying proinflammatory response induced by mitochondrial damage during viral infections, providing new insights for antiviral strategies.">

        <tr id="Background: A complement imbalance in lung alveolar tissue can play a deteriorating role in COVID-19, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CD55 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that inhibits the activation of the complement system at the intermediate cascade level, blocking the activity of the C3 convertase. Objective: In our study, lung specimens from COVID-19 and ARDS-positive COVID+/ARDS+ patients were compared with COVID-19 and ARDS-negative COVID–/ARDS– as well as COVID–/ARDS+ patients. Methods: Histochemical staining and immunolabeling of CD55 protein were performed. Results: The COVID–/ARDS– specimen showed higher expression and homogeneous distribution of glycosaminoglycans as well as compactly arranged elastic and collagen fibers of the alveolar walls in comparison to ARDS-affected lungs. In addition, COVID–/ARDS– lung tissues revealed stronger and homogenously distributed CD55 expression on the alveolar walls in comparison to the disrupted COVID–/ARDS+ lung tissues. Conclusions: Even though the collapse of the alveolar linings and the accumulation of cellular components in the alveolar spaces were characteristic of COVID+/ARDS+ lung tissues, evaluating CD55 expression could be relevant to understand its relation to the disease. Furthermore, targeting CD55 upregulation as a potential therapy could be an option for post-infectious complications of COVID-19 and other inflammatory lung diseases in the future.">

        <tr id="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm birth. Supplemental oxygen administration, while lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to develop BPD. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that the innate immune response activated in the lungs of mice sensitive to hyperoxia that develop BPD-like lung injury differs from mice resilient to disease. Specifically, we identified a selective upregulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on lung macrophages and monocytes in the hyperoxia-sensitive C57BL/6J mouse strain. We show that loss of function of TREM2 signaling in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatically improved phenotype after neonatal hyperoxia exposure characterized by a dampened immune response, preserved alveolar structure, and preserved cell proliferative potential supporting normal lung development. At the molecular level, inhibition of TREM2 signaling dampened the magnitude of p53 activation and resulted in cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. These findings show that TREM2 is a critical regulator of the pathogenic innate immune response to hyperoxia and highlight its importance as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating injury in the hyperoxia-exposed developing lung.">

Acute infectious diseases are some of the most common reasons for receiving medical care, and analysis of the host immune response is an attractive approach for their diagnosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential usefulness of CD169 expression on peripheral monocytes (mCD169) as a marker of viral-associated host immune response.


METHODS
In a large mono-institutional cohort of 4,025 patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) and other viral infections, mCD169 analysis was performed by rapid flow cytometry assay.


RESULTS
Increased mCD169 values (median, 17.50; IQR, 8.40-25.72) were found in 1,631 patients with CoV2+ acute infection compared to 2,394 in CoV2- patients (median, 2.35; IQR, 2.0-3.25) (odds ratio [OR], 21.84; 95% CI ,17.53-27.21; P < .001). Among CoV2- patients, 1,484 (62.0%) were assessed for other viral infections, and viral etiology was laboratory confirmed in 428 patients (CoV2- Vir+), with RNA viruses most frequently detected (94.6%). Higher levels of mCD169 were also confirmed in CoV2- Vir+ compared to CoV2- Vir- patients (OR, 10.05; 95% CI, 7.35-13.74; P < .001).


CONCLUSIONS
mCD169 analysis by rapid flow cytometry assay may be a sensitive broad marker useful for the rapid triage of patients with suspected acute viral infections and could potentially be directly applied to eventual new emergent viral outbreaks.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="Background/Rationale We investigated the effect of pre-existing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronaviruses on infection outcomes in Omicron BA1/2 exposed household members from January to March 2022. Methods Data from a prospective household study in the Netherlands were used including 63 households with 195 household members exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA1/2 index case. The protocol included repeated nose-throat swab and saliva RT-PCR testing, paired serology, and self-reported daily symptom scoring by household members. Infection outcomes included the occurrence of secondary infections, symptom severity, and CT-value trajectories. We studied the effect of baseline binding antibody levels for SARS-CoVs and seasonal coronaviruses (hCoV) NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 spike protein, on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Results 132 of 195 (68%) exposed household members developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among exposed household members, higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies (HKU1 and OC43) at baseline, were associated with a reduced risk of secondary infection (adjusted Odds ratio 0.61; 95% Confidence interval 0.44-0.84 and aOR 0.72; 95%CI 0.56-0.92, respectively). No significant differences between antibody levels and symptom burden or CT-value trajectories were observed. Conclusions Our study suggests that prior SARS-CoV-2 and beta hCoV antibodies provide some protection against Omicron BA.1/BA.2 infection, while effects on symptom burden or CT-value could not be demonstrated. The results highlight the relatively limited, but not negligible role of cross-protective antibodies, especially when facing immune escape variants of SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated severity have been linked to uncontrolled inflammation and may be associated with changes in the microbiome of mucosal sites including the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity. These sites play an important role in host-microbe homeostasis, and disruption of epithelial barrier integrity during COVID-19 may potentially lead to exacerbated inflammation and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in COVID-19 are highly disparate, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal, and the impact of microbial dysbiosis on disease severity is unclear. Here, we obtained plasma, rectal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasal swabs from 86 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 12 healthy volunteers. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing to characterize the microbial communities in the mucosal swabs and measured concentrations of circulating cytokines, markers of gut barrier integrity, and fatty acids in the plasma samples. We compared these plasma concentrations and microbiomes between healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients, some of whom had unfortunately died by the end of the study enrollment, and performed a correlation analysis between plasma variables and bacterial abundances. Rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients had reduced abundances of several commensal bacteria including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increased abundance of the opportunistic pathogens Eggerthella lenta and Hungatella hathewayi. Furthermore, the oral pathogen Scardovia wiggsiae was more abundant in the oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients who died. The abundance of both H. hathewayi and S. wiggsiae correlated with circulating inflammatory markers including IL-6, highlighting the possible role of the microbiome in COVID-19 severity and providing potential therapeutic targets for managing COVID-19.IMPORTANCEOutcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are highly disparate and are associated with uncontrolled inflammation; however, the individual factors that lead to this uncontrolled inflammation are not fully understood. Here, we report that severe COVID-19 is associated with systemic inflammation, microbial translocation, and microbial dysbiosis. The rectal and oropharyngeal microbiomes of COVID-19 patients were characterized by a decreased abundance of commensal bacteria and an increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens, which positively correlated with markers of inflammation and microbial translocation. These microbial perturbations may, therefore, contribute to disease severity in COVID-19 and highlight the potential for microbiome-based interventions in improving COVID-19 outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection often causes coagulation disorders that affect highly vascularized organs, such as the lungs and kidneys.

Objective
The objective of this study was to report the histopathological findings of variations in the fibrin pattern of pulmonary and renal microthrombi in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Minimally invasive autopsies were performed on 40 patients to collect lung (n=40) and kidney (n=16) tissue samples. Histochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques were used for histopathological analyses. Premortem laboratory data were obtained from the patients' electronic medical records.

Results
The lung tissue showed a patchy pattern, characterized by areas of both minimal and severe damage. The most significant histopathological finding was the detection of thrombi with fibrin structures organized into discrete star-shaped units, which were more frequently observed in areas with severe lung injury than in those with minimal lung injury (p = 0.012). Star-shaped fibrin structures were also observed in the renal glomerular capillaries. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of platelets and the procoagulant proteins von Willebrand factor (VWF) and Factor VIII within the star-shaped fibrin thrombi. Patients with star-shaped fibrin thrombi had higher levels of the systemic inflammatory indicators C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).

Conclusion
Our observations suggest that the inflammatory microenvironment resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the formation of star-shaped fibrin units in the pulmonary and renal microthrombi.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as one of the worst viral pandemics during the past few years. As reported by the World Health Organization, around 77,56 49 520 cases and 70 51 720 deaths were reported from all over the world, which includes approximately 3500 patients reported during the recent past only. Currently, circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 are KP.3, JN.1, BA.2.86 and KP.2. Mass vaccinations have been provided since the end of December 2020, which led to 5.47 billion people vaccinated till date. However, the disease continues in small foci all over the world. Development of an effective drug target and mutation independent vaccine thus becomes essential research priorities. Owing to the unavailability of a specific drug molecule, the present study has focused on the development of an effective drug target to treat COVID-19. In-house primers were designed for four essential structural genes viz., Spike protein, ORF1ab, Nucleocapsid gene, and Envelope gene. Samples of different waves were amplified using these primers employing the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. A total number of 86 SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR positive samples were studied, and results showed the most frequent appearance (80.2%) of Envelope (E) protein in all the samples. This suggests that during transmission across numbers of human hosts, it is the Envelope protein that was the most stable one. The most severe Delta variant showed the presence of E proteins in all the samples assayed. Blocking E protein as a new drug target to intervene intracellular replication of virus could be an effective drug development strategy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are a major global contributor to morbidity and mortality. The susceptibility and outcome of RVIs are strongly age-dependent and show considerable inter-population differences, pointing to genetically and/or environmentally driven developmental variability. The factors determining the age-dependency and shaping the age-related changes of human anti-RVI immunity after birth are still elusive. Methods We are conducting a prospective birth cohort study aiming at identifying endogenous and environmental factors associated with the susceptibility to RVIs and their impact on cellular and humoral immune responses against the influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The MIAI birth cohort enrolls healthy, full-term neonates born at the University Hospital Würzburg, Germany, with follow-up at four defined time-points during the first year of life. At each study visit, clinical metadata including diet, lifestyle, sociodemographic information, and physical examinations, are collected along with extensive biomaterial sampling. Biomaterials are used to generate comprehensive, integrated multi-omics datasets including transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic and microbiomic methods. Discussion The results are expected to capture a holistic picture of the variability of immune trajectories with a focus on cellular and humoral key players involved in the defense of RVIs and the impact of host and environmental factors thereon. Thereby, MIAI aims at providing insights that allow unraveling molecular mechanisms that can be targeted to promote the development of competent anti-RVI immunity in early life and prevent severe RVIs.

        <tr id="Astroviruses are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and have been recognized to cause fatal cases of encephalitis. A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model, as previous attempts failed to identify a suitable host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans that is a causative agent of encephalitis. VA1 RNA levels peak in heart tissue at day 7 post-inoculation. The cardiotropism was observed in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds evidenced by high VA1 RNA loads in heart tissue of A/J, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, Balb/c, and J:ARC mice. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Intracellular viral capsid was present in tissue sections based on immunofluorescent staining and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA co-localizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by > 10-fold in heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we also tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in human cardiac microvascular and coronary artery endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of viral pathogenesis and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses. Author Summary Astroviruses typically cause viral diarrhea in humans but can also cause serious infections of the brain. Previously, the methods available to study how these viruses lead to invasive infections were limited. Here, we describe the first system to study human-infecting astroviruses using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infected heart tissue and was associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of virus in their hearts and blood. Linking back to human health, we also found that VA1 can infect cells derived from human blood vessels of the heart. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans. In the future, we can develop interventions that will prevent and treat astrovirus infections in humans.">

        <tr id="Enteroviruses are a genus of small RNA viruses that are responsible for approximately one billion global infections annually. These infections range in severity from the common cold and flu-like symptoms to more severe diseases, such as viral myocarditis, pancreatitis, and neurological disorders, that continue to pose a global health challenge with limited therapeutic strategies currently available. In the current study, we sought to understand the interaction between coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which is a model enterovirus, and macrophage cells, as there is limited understanding of how this virus interacts with macrophage innate immune cells. Our study demonstrated that CVB3 can robustly activate macrophages without apparent viral replication in these cells. We also showed that myeloid cells lacked the viral entry receptor coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). However, the expression of exogenous CAR in RAW264.7 macrophages was unable to overcome the viral replication deficit. Interestingly, the CAR expression was associated with altered inflammatory responses during prolonged infection. Additionally, we identified the autophagy protein LC3 as a novel stimulus for macrophage activation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of CVB3-induced macrophage activation and its implications for viral pathogenesis.">

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, named ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19). Several mechanisms contribute to the reduction in serotonin levels, such as the impaired absorption of dietary tryptophan, hindered serotonin transport via platelets, and increased activity of an enzyme responsible for breaking down serotonin. Individuals seeking treatment for long COVID-19 had lower serotonin levels in their blood than those who had fully recovered from the infection. Furthermore, patients with long COVID-19 also had reduced tryptophan levels. The potential benefits of dietary supplementation with tryptophan or the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to improve cognitive impairments and depressive and anxiety disorders in long-term COVID-19 patients. The findings support the immune response’s pivotal role in modulating serotonin levels and further highlight the intricate connection between the immune system and neurotransmitter regulation.">

        <tr id="Lung tumor-promoting environmental exposures and γherpesvirus infections are associated with Type 17 inflammation. To test the effect of γherpesvirus infection in promoting lung tumorigenesis, we infected mutant K-Ras-expressing (K-RasLA1) mice with the murine γherpesvirus MHV68 via oropharyngeal aspiration. After 7 weeks, the infected mice displayed a more than 2-fold increase in lung tumors relative to their K-RasLA1 uninfected littermates. Assessment of cytokines in the lung revealed that expression of Type 17 cytokines (Il-6, Cxcl1, Csf3) peaked at day 7 post-infection. These observations correlated with the post-infection appearance of known immune mediators of tumor promotion via IL-17A in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, Cd84, an immune cell marker mRNA, did not increase in MHV68-infected wild-type mice lacking lung tumors. Csf3 and Cxcl1 protein levels increased more in the lungs of infected K-RasLA1 mice relative to infected wild-type littermates. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the infected K-RasLA1 mice had increased Ly6Gdim/Ly6Chi immune cells in the lung relative to levels seen in uninfected control K-RasLA1 mice. Selective methylation of adenosines (m6A modification) in immune-cell-enriched mRNAs appeared to correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. These observations implicate γherpesvirus infection in lung tumor promotion and selective accumulation of immune cells in the lung that appears to be associated with m6A modification of mRNAs in those cells.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is characterized by excessive inflammation leading to the development of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) derived from ω6 and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are central to the regulation of inflammation, controlling both its initiation and resolution. Still, their role in COVID-19 remains underexplored. By employing a holistic approach involving the analysis of white blood cell transcriptomes, targeted lipidomics, cytokine and immune cell profiling, across the spectrum of disease severity groups, including mild non-hospitalized patients and healthy individuals, we now show that LM networks are profoundly altered in COVID-19, correlate with inflammatory patterns, and stratify patients according to disease severity. Central to this are CYP450-derived LMs such as 20-HETE, lipid peroxidation metabolites such as iPF2a-VI, and lipoxygenase-derived LMs such as 12-HETE, all of which are major vasoactive mediators of inflammation. Among them, 20-HETE appears to be a promising prognostic biomarker for ICU admission and a potential therapeutic target for severe COVID-19 disease. Our study thus underscores the significance of LM networks in COVID-19 pathophysiology and sheds light into the broader mechanisms driving viral pneumonia in humans.">

        <tr id="IL-23 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the cellular targets and signaling pathways affected by this cytokine remain poorly understood. We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

Although research into underlying mechanisms is evolving, immunity is understudied. As the recall of T cell memory promotes more rapid recovery and ameliorates disease outcomes, establishment of robust memory T cells is important for protection against subsequent infections, even when the virus mutates. We defined how SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and B cell responses are established and maintained following infection and vaccination for 2 y in people with long COVID.

Vaccines and antivirals are sorely lacking and developments in these areas are hampered by the lack of an adequate cell culture system to investigate human norovirus replication and pathogenesis. Herein, we describe how the model norovirus, Mouse norovirus (MNV), produces a viral protein, NS3, with the functional capacity to attenuate host protein translation which invokes the activation of cell death via apoptosis. We show that this function of NS3 is conserved between human and mouse viruses and map the protein domain attributable to this function. Our study highlights a critical viral protein that mediates crucial activities during replication, potentially identifying NS3 as a worthy target for antiviral drug development.">

        <tr id="Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders. One sentence summary Type I interferon sensing neutrophils accumulate in meninges of psychosocially stressed mice via skull bone marrow channels and are associated with the negative behavioral sequelae of stress; blockade of this pathway inhibits neutrophil trafficking and improves behavioral outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune profiling of Nipah virus (NiV) infection survivors is essential for advancing our understanding of NiV pathogenesis, improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and guiding public health efforts to prevent future outbreaks. There is currently limited data available on the immune response to NiV infection. We aimed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms involved in protection against NiV infection by analyzing the immune profiles of survivors of the Nipah outbreak in Kerala, India 2023. Immune cell populations were quantified and compared between survivors (up to 4 months post onset day of illness) and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore associations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes. Immune signatures common to all three cases were: a heretofore undescribed persistent lymphopenia including the CD4+ Treg compartment with the relative expansion of memory Tregs; trends indicative of global leukopenic modulation were observed in monocytes and granulocytes including an expansion of putatively immunosuppressive low-density granulocytes described recently in the context of severe COVID-19; altered mucosal homing with respect to integrin beta-7 (ITGB7) expressing subsets; increased mobilization of activated T-cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and plasmablasts in the early phase of infection. Comparative analysis based on clinical presentation and outcome yielded lower initial viremia, increased activated T-cell responses, expanded plasmablasts, and restoration of ITGB7 expressing CD8+ T-cells as possible protective signatures. This longitudinal study delineates putative protective signatures associated with milder NiV disease. It emphasizes the need for the development of immunotherapeutic interventions such as monoclonal antibodies to blunt early viremia and ameliorate pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors are frequently observed to present persistent symptoms constituting what has been called “post-acute COVID-19 syndrome” (PACS) or “long COVID-19”. Some clinical risk factors have been identified to be associated with PACS development; however, specific mechanisms responsible for PACS pathology remain unknown. This study investigates clinical, immunological, and metabolomic risk factors associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) in 51 patients, assessed 7–19 months after acute infection. Among the participants, 62.7% were male and 37.2% were female, with an average age of 47.8 years. At the follow-up, 37.2% met the criteria for PACS, revealing significant differences in immunological and metabolomic profiles at the time of acute infection. Patients with PACS were characterized by elevated levels of mature low-density granulocytes (LDGs), interleukin-8 (IL-8), pyruvate, pseudouridine, and cystine. Baseline multivariate analysis showed increased pyruvate and decreased alpha tocopherol levels. At follow-up, there was a decrease in absolute B lymphocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid levels. These findings suggest that specific immunological and metabolomic markers during acute infection can help identify patients at higher risk of developing persistent PACS.">

Here, we used blood samples from a human influenza H3N2 challenge study to perform comprehensive multi-omic analyses. We detected remodeling of immune programs in innate immune cells after resolution of the infection that was proportional in magnitude to the level of prior viral load. We found changes associated with suppressed inflammation including decreased cytokine and AP-1 gene expression as well as decreased accessibility at AP-1 targets and interleukin-related gene promoter regions. We also found decreased histone deacetylase gene expression, increased MAP kinase gene expression, and increased accessibility at interferon-related gene promoter regions. Genes involved in inflammation and epigenetic-remodeling showed modulation of gene-chromatin site regulatory circuit activity. These results reveal a coordinated rewiring of the epigenetic landscape in innate immune cells induced by mild influenza virus infection.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="The increased incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, occurring in patients infected with severe influenza or SARS-CoV-2, suggests that antiviral immune responses create an environment permissive to fungal infection. Our recent evidence suggests that absence of the type I IFN receptor 2 subunit (IFNAR2) of the heterodimeric IFNAR1/2 receptor is allowing for this permissive immune environment of the lung through regulation of damage responses. Because damage is associated with poor outcome to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, this suggested that IFNAR2 may be involved in A. fumigatus susceptibility. In this study, we determined that absence of IFNAR2 resulted in increased inflammation, morbidity, and damage in the lungs in response to A. fumigatus challenge, whereas absence of IFNAR1 did not. Although the Ifnar2-/- mice had increased morbidity, we found that the Ifnar2-/- mice cleared more conidia compared with both wild-type and Ifnar1-/- mice. However, this early clearance did not prevent invasive disease from developing in the Ifnar2-/- mice as infection progressed. Importantly, by altering the inflamed environment of the Ifnar2-/- mice early during A. fumigatus infection, by neutralizing TNF-α, we were able to reduce the morbidity and fungal clearance in these mice back to wild-type levels. Together, our results establish a distinct role for IFNAR2 in regulating host damage responses to A. fumigatus and contributing to an A. fumigatus-permissive environment through regulation of inflammation. Specifically, our data reveal a role for IFNAR2 in regulating TNF-α-mediated damage and morbidity during A. fumigatus infection.">

Initially, microglia increased tissue surveillance upon encountering GB-cells in sparsely infiltrated areas. In contrast, when GB-cell density increased, microglia reduced surveillance, suggesting a biphasic response to tumor invasion. Additionally, microglia were not uniformly attracted to infiltrating GB-cells; only a subset moved directionally toward them within a defined spatial range.

Postmortem examination of the lung is a useful tool for understanding the immunopathogenesis of this virus. Lung autopsy samples from seven dead SARS-CoV-2 patients were obtained and evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin stain to analyze the histopathological changes in those samples, on the other hand, Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used for detection of CD21, CD1a, CR1 (CD35), CD68, Myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD15, CD56, CD3, CD20, CD4, and CD8 cells markers. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse alveolar damage with extensive parenchymal architecture distortion, intravascular fibrin clot, deposition of collagen fibers, vascular congestions and blood vessels containing thrombi, pneumocyte type II with inflammatory cell infiltration. The IHC staining for the innate immune cells such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, Macrophages, and neutrophils showed a strong positive staining, while CD56 Natural killer (NK) cells showed negative staining. On the other hand, the specific immune cells including; CD20 B cells, CD3 T cells, and CD4 helper T cells, showed positive staining while CD8 Cytotoxic T cells showed negative staining. The lung autopsy samples from patients with COVID-19 confirmed the presence of APCs through the positive staining of CD21, CD1a, CD35, CD68, MPO, and CD15 expressed the virus recognition, proinflammatory cytokine production, and adaptive immune cells activation through CD3, CD4, and CD20 positive staining and the role of APCs in the severity of pulmonary infection and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection however the absence of the CD56 NK and CD8 cytotoxic T explains the worse infection status for the patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease and is widespread over the world. This disease shows a 5.1% mortality. The understanding of the disease has expanded rapidly in many areas, including virological, epidemiological, clinical, and management dimensions. To better understand the inflammatory and immune profiles that impact the pathogenesis and development of severe COVID-19 symptoms, further studies are essential. This research aims to explore the inflammatory and adaptive immune responses associated with COVID-19, considering factors such as genetic diversity and environmental exposure among Saudi patients. The goal is to determine if patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit different disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: This case-control study includes 115 participants (healthy and with COVID-19 infection), 55 of which had confirmed cases of COVID-19 in intensive care units (ICUs) at different hospitals in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia. Whole blood samples were collected from June to September 2021 for cellular analyses, and inflammation marker data were collected from hospital records. The expression of activation markers on B (CD27 and CD38) and T cells (CD27 and HLA-DR) was obtained using the flow cytometry technique. Also, serum was collected for cytokine measurements, including IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF- α. Results: The results indicated that lymphopenia and excessive T cell activation were more prevalent in severe cases than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the results revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had an increased frequency of CD19+ B cells, with changes in B cell subsets. The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers with pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: The current study implies impairment and changes in the phenotype of adaptive cells (including T and B cells), with an increase in HLA-DR molecules and inflammation markers in severe COVID-19 cases, which could be targeted for therapeutic interventions. This might be a valuable approach for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Introduction After mild COVID-19 that does not require hospitalization, some individuals develop persistent symptoms that may worsen over time, producing a multisystemic condition termed Post-COVID condition (PCC). Among other disorders, PCC is characterized by persistent changes in the immune system that may not be solved several months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods People with PCC were recruited to determine the distribution and functionality of CD4+ T helper (Th) subsets in comparison with individuals with mild, severe, and critical presentations of acute COVID-19 to evaluate their contribution as risk or protective factors for PCC. Results People with PCC showed low levels of Th1 cells, similar to individuals with severe and critical COVID-19, although these cells presented a higher capacity to express IFNγ in response to stimulation. Th2/Th1 correlation was negative in individuals with acute forms of COVID-19, but there was no significant Th2/Th1 correlation in people with PCC. Th2 cells from people with PCC presented high capacity to express IL-4 and IL-13, which are related to low ventilation and death associated with COVID-19. Levels of proinflammatory Th9 and Th17 subsets were significantly higher in people with PCC in comparison with acute COVID-19, being Th1/Th9 correlation negative in these individuals, which probably contributed to a more pro-inflammatory than antiviral scenario. Th17 cells from approximately 50% of individuals with PCC had no capacity to express IL-17A and IL-22, similar to individuals with critical COVID-19, which would prevent clearing extracellular pathogens. Th2/Th17 correlation was positive in people with PCC, which in the absence of negative Th1/Th2 correlation could also contribute to the proinflammatory state. Finally, Th22 cells from most individuals with PCC had no capacity to express IL-13 or IL-22, which could increase tendency to reinfections due to impaired epithelial regeneration. Discussion People with PCC showed skewed polarization of CD4+ Th subsets with altered functionality that was more similar to individuals with severe and critical presentations of acute COVID-19 than to people who fully recovered from mild disease. New strategies aimed at reprogramming the immune response and redirecting CD4+ Th cell polarization may be necessary to reduce the proinflammatory environment characteristic of PCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Extracellular vesicles (EV), key players in cell-to-cell communication, may contribute to disease propagation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), by favoring the dissemination of neurotoxic proteins within the brain. Interestingly, growing evidence supports the role of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we investigated whether HSV-1 infection could promote the spread of phosphorylated tau (ptau) among neurons via EV. We analyzed the ptau species that were secreted via EV following HSV-1 infection in neuroblastoma cells and primary neurons, focusing particularly on T205, T181, and T217, the phosphorylation sites mainly associated with AD. Moreover, by overexpressing human tau tagged with GFP (htauGFP), we found that recipient tau knockout (KO) neurons uptook EV that are loaded with HSV-1-induced phtauGFP. Finally, we exploited an in vivo model of acute infection and assessed that cerebral HSV-1 infection promotes the release of ptau via EV in the brain of infected mice. Overall, our data suggest that, following HSV-1 infection, EV play a role in tau spreading within the brain, thus contributing to neurodegeneration. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection that reaches the brain has been repeatedly linked with the appearance of the pathognomonic markers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including accumulation of amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and cognitive deficits. AD is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease representing the most common form of dementia in the elderly, and no cure is currently available, thus prompting additional investigation on potential risk factors and pathological mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the virus exploits the extracellular vesicles (EV) to disseminate phosphorylated tau (ptau) among brain cells. Importantly, we provide evidence that the HSV-1-induced EV-bearing ptau can be undertaken by recipient neurons, thus likely contributing to misfolding and aggregation of native tau, as reported for other AD models. Hence, our data highlight a novel mechanism exploited by HSV-1 to propagate tau-related damage in the brain.">

        <tr id="Microglial cells are the phagocytic cells of the brain that under physiological conditions participate in brain homeostasis and surveillance. Under pathogenic states, microglia undergoes strong morphological and transcriptional changes potentially leading to sustained neuroinflammation, brain damage, and cognitive disorders. Postnatal and adult Zika virus (ZIKV) brain infection is characterized by the induction of reactive microglia associated with brain inflammation, synapse loss and neuropathogenesis. Contrary to neurons, microglial cells are not infected by ZIKV thus raising the question of the mechanism governing ZIKV-induced microglia's reactivity. In this work, we have questioned the role of exogenous, neuronal type I interferons (IFNs-I) in regulating ZIKV-induced microglia's reactivity. Primary cultured microglial cells were either treated with conditioned media from ZIKV-infected mature neurons or co-cultured with ZIKV-infected neurons. Using either an antibody directed against the IFNAR receptor that neutralizes the IFNs-I response or Ifnar-/-microglial cells, we demonstrate that IFNs-I produced by ZIKV-infected neurons are the main regulators of the phagocytic capacity and the pro-inflammatory gene expression profile of reactive, non-infected microglial cells. We identify protein kinase R (PKR), whose expression is activated by IFNs-I, as a major regulator of the phagocytic capacity, pro-inflammatory response, and morphological changes of microglia induced by IFNs-I while up-regulating STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression. Results obtained herein in vitro with primary cultured cells and in vivo in ZIKV-infected adult immunocompetent mice, unravel a role for IFNs-I and PKR in directly regulating microglia's reactivity that could be at work in other infectious and non-infectious brain pathologies.">

        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The dynamics of the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) breakthrough infections remain unclear, particularly when compared to responses in naive individuals. In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, 13 participants were recruited. Peripheral blood samples were collected every other day until day 7 after symptom onset. Transcriptome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing, Olink proteomics, and antigen-antibody binding experiments were then performed. During the incubation periods of breakthrough infections, peripheral blood exhibited type 2 cytokine response, which shifted to type 1 cytokine response upon symptom onset. Plasma cytokine levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 show larger changes in breakthrough infections than naïve infections. The inflammatory response in breakthrough infections rapidly subsided, returning to homeostasis by day 5 after symptom onset. Notably, the levels of monocyte-derived S100A8/A9, previously considered a marker of severe disease, physiologically significantly increased in the early stages of mild cases and persisted until day 7, suggesting a specific biological function. Longitudinal tracking also revealed that antibodies anti-Receptor Binding Domain (anti-RBD) in breakthrough infections significantly increased by day 7 after symptom onset, whereas cytotoxic T lymphocytes appeared by day 5. This study presents a reference for interpreting the immunological response to breakthrough infectious disease in humans.">

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is a heterogeneous clinical condition of uncertain etiology triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we used ultrasensitive approaches to profile the immune system and the plasma proteome in healthy convalescent individuals and individuals with long COVID, spanning geographically independent cohorts from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Symptomatic disease was not consistently associated with quantitative differences in immune cell lineage composition or antiviral T cell immunity. Healthy convalescent individuals nonetheless exhibited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than individuals with long COVID, and extensive phenotypic analyses revealed a subtle increase in the expression of some co-inhibitory receptors, most notably PD-1 and TIM-3, among SARS-CoV-2 nonspike-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with long COVID. We further identified a shared plasma biomarker signature of disease linking breathlessness with apoptotic inflammatory networks centered on various proteins, including CCL3, CD40, IKBKG, IL-18 and IRAK1, and dysregulated pathways associated with cell cycle progression, lung injury and platelet activation, which could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

        <tr id="Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. The choroid plexus (ChP), serving as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid-brain barrier, plays essential roles in immune response to stress and brain homeostasis. However, the cellular and molecular contributions of the ChP to AD progression remain inadequately understood. Methods To elucidate the molecular abnormalities during the early stages of AD, we acquired single-cell transcription profiling of ChP from APP/PS1 mice with early-stage of Aβ pathology and litter-mate controls. The transcriptional alterations that occurred in each cell type were identified by differentially expressed genes, cell–cell communications and pseudotemporal trajectory analysis. The findings were subsequently validated by a series of in situ and in vitro assays. Results We constructed a comprehensive atlas of ChP at single-cell resolution and identified six major cell types and immune subclusters in male mice. The majority of dysregulated genes were found in the epithelial cells of APP/PS1 mice in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, and most of these genes belonged to down-regulated module involved in mitochondrial respirasome assembly, cilium organization, and barrier integrity. The disruption of the epithelial barrier resulted in the downregulation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) secretion in APP/PS1 mice, leading to macrophage activation and increased phagocytosis of Aβ. Concurrently, ligands (e.g., APOE) secreted by macrophages and other ChP cells facilitated the entry of lipids into ependymal cells, leading to lipid accumulation and the activation of microglia in the brain parenchyma in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT controls. Conclusions Taken together, these data profiled early transcriptional and cellular abnormalities of ChP within an AD mouse model, providing novel insights of cerebral vasculature into the pathobiology of AD.

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a significant risk to immunocompromised patients, who display weakened immunity and reduced seroconversion following infection and vaccination. In this study, we recruited 19 hospitalized patients with immune disorders (ImCo) and 4 immunocompetent controls (ICC) with COVID-19. We evaluated their serological, humoral, and cellular immune responses at <30 days and >90 days post-symptom onset. ICC patients showed robust B and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, indicated by detectable antibody levels, memory antibody-secreting cells (mASCs) towards the spike protein and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. ImCo patients showed impaired immune responses, with lower levels of B cell responses. Further subdivision of the ImCo patients demonstrates that solid organ transplant (SOT) patients generated B cell responses similar to ICC patients, whereas the other ImCo patients, including patients with hematological malignancies and anti-CD20 therapy, did not. Absolute T cell numbers and spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were low in the ImCo patients at <30 days but increased at later time points. Our findings suggest that even when B cell responses were reduced, patients could present a T cell response, suggesting a more successful line of passive immunization for immunocompromised individuals focusing on boosting T cell responses.">

        <tr id="Viral encephalitis, resulting from neurotropic viral infections, leads to severe neurological impairment, inflammation, and exhibits high mortality rates with poor prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of effective targeted treatments for this disease, which poses a significant public health concern. SARM1 has been identified as the pivotal mediator of axonal degeneration and inflammation across various neuropathies, activated by an elevation in the NMN/NAD+ ratio. However, comprehensive in vivo investigations into the role of SARM1-mediated pathogenesis in viral encephalitis are still lacking. In this study, we established mouse models of viral encephalitis using Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and rabies virus (RABV) as representative pathogens. Our findings demonstrate that neurotropic virus infections elicit robust axonal degeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, and profound neuropathological damage in cortical neurons via the activation of SARM1. In mouse models of viral encephalitis, deletion or inhibition of SARM1 effectively preserved axonal morphology and maintained mitochondrial homeostasis, while also attenuating the infiltration of CD45+ leukocytes in the cortex. Consequently, these interventions ameliorated neuropathological damage and enhanced survival outcomes in mice. Our findings suggest that SARM1-mediated axonal degeneration and brain inflammation exacerbate the pathological progression of viral encephalitis. Therapies targeting SARM1 emerge as viable and promising strategies for protecting neuronal function in the context of neurotropic viral infections.

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. ZF2001, a protein subunit vaccine targeting the RBD, was utilized to evaluate its impact on the immune system of COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate peripheral cell profiles one year after three doses of ZF2001 vaccine using single cell mass spectrometry flow cytometry (CyTOF), a technique that allows detailed characterization of the immune response against SARS-COV-2 infection and further evaluation of ZF2001 mechanisms as a prophylactic against chronic disease and reducing mortality. Methods This study profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 vaccinated COVID-19 patients (Omicron 5.2) and 8 hDs using CyTOF with a 41-antibody panel. PBMCs isolated via Lymphoprep density gradient underwent metal-tagged antibody staining. Data analysis included FlowJo gating, Seurat/Harmony batch correction, PhenoGraph clustering (k=45), and t-SNE visualization. Statistical assessments employed Wilcoxon tests and Spearman correlation. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between infected and healthy individuals one year after three doses of ZF2001. Specifically, infected individuals exhibited: significant elevation of cytotoxic T cells expressing CD8 with a proliferation marker antigen-Kiel 67 (Ki67) and an adhesion molecule (CD138), expansion of B cells and reduction of monocytes expressing CD16, as well as depletion of CD4+ T cells and differentiation of T cells 1 year after the vaccine. These changes suggested that the vaccine was effectively modulating the immune response. Discussion Our results provided a detailed single-cell profile of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated patients, highlighting significant changes in immune cell kinetics indicative of an active innate and adaptive immune cell response.">

        <tr id="Objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a primary contributor to chronic functional impairment in human populations, initiating complex neuroinflammatory cascades and neurodegeneration. Despite extensive research efforts, the precise pathophysiological pathways remain incompletely characterized. This investigation aims to establish a novel therapeutic strategy that targets critical molecular pathways post-injury, potentially addressing the current limitations in the clinical management of TBI patients. Methods The single-cell data of cortical tissue from mice with TBI were obtained from public databases (GSE160763), which was utilized to identify alterations in in the composition of disease-associated cells and related molecules as the disease progresses. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional characteristics of microglia and astrocyte subpopulations. Trajectory analysis was employed to investigate cell differentiation characteristics. Subsequently, we examined the expression and function of microglia-specific molecules, such as IFI204, along with their underlying molecular mechanisms using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), histopathology, behavioral tests, and molecular docking to assess binding status, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we used molecular docking technology to find small molecule compounds that IFI204 can stably bind to. Results We identified nine major cell populations, most of which undergo dynamic changes following TBI. Astrocytes and microglia were the predominant populations in each group, and further cluster analysis revealed that the proportions of interferon (IFN) and axonogenesis-related microglial subtypes increased after TBI. Trajectory inference analysis indicated that the expression of Ifi204 is upregulated in microglia during disease progression. Conditional microglial knockdown of IFI204 significantly improved neurological deficits in mice, and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and microglial pyroptosis. Mechanistically, SENP7, identified as a novel molecule, interacts with IFI204 in microglia, catalyzes the deSUMOylation of IFI204, and promotes STING signal activation, ultimately driving microglial pyroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions The interaction between IFI204 and SENP7 promotes microglial pyroptosis and related mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, in the case of TBI, we hypothesize that targeting IFI204 might yield therapeutic benefits.

        <tr id="Immune responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) following influenza A virus (IAV) infection can influence disease severity, and subsequently inflammation and lung tissue damage in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). This study investigated the role of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a key pattern recognition receptor that senses viral RNA and triggers antiviral and proinflammatory signaling to activate immune responses, in specifically shaping URT and LRT immune responses to IAV infection. Wild type C57Bl/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice were infected with the H3N2 IAV strain Hk-X31, and key immune responses in the nasal tissue (URT) and lower airways and lung tissue (LRT) measured after acute infection. We found reduced body weight loss, and increased type II/III interferons and proinflammatory cytokines in the URT of TLR7 KO mice; while LRT inflammation was reduced. TLR7 was essential for activating immune responses in the LRT but played a more selective role in the URT, primarily influencing monocytes, pDCs and B cells. Our data suggest that TLR7 plays a critical role in the transition of inflammation from the URT to the LRT during IAV infection, making it a promising therapeutic target to modulate disease severity.

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections trigger immune and inflammatory responses that can be associated with excessive oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) depletion, and a cytokine storm that drives virus-induced cell/tissue damage and severe disease. Erdosteine is a thiol-based drug with proven mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties, but less is known about its antiviral effects. We performed in vitro studies to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of erdosteine in A549-hACE2 human lung epithelial cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and in Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells infected with influenza A virus (H1N1). The cells were treated with different concentrations of erdosteine or its active metabolite 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MET-1) before and after viral infection. The viral replication/load in the cell culture supernatants was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay and digital droplet PCR. The gene expression of innate immune response signaling pathways and oxidative stress was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR custom-array. The results showed that erdosteine and its active metabolite, at concentrations consistent with an approved therapeutic human dosage, were not directly cytotoxic and had significant antiviral effects in cells pre-infected with SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and H1N1. The transcriptome analysis showed that erdosteine activated innate immune responses by stimulating overexpression of type I interferon and inflammasome pathways and modulated oxidative stress by inducing the modulation of oxidative stress and GSH pathways. These findings suggest that erdosteine may be a useful treatment for respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The spike S1 subunit induces inflammatory cytokine production, but the immune cell subsets that respond to S1 stimulation and contribute to disease severity remain unclear. Methods We analyzed serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 (moderate: n = 7; severe: n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 38). Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement. The frequency of CD147hi cMono showed a stronger positive correlation with clinical severity markers in younger patients compared to older patients. Conclusions CD147hi cMono are the primary cellular source of S1-induced inflammatory cytokines and may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity and treatment response.

        <tr id="Correlates of protection (CoPs) for SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be sufficiently defined. This study uses the machine learning platform, SIMON, to accurately predict the immunological parameters that reduced clinical pathology or viral load following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a cohort of 90 non-human primates. We found that anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody and neutralising antibody titres were the best predictors of clinical protection and low viral load in the lung. Since antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike showed the greatest association with clinical protection and reduced viral load, we next used SIMON to investigate the immunological features that predict high antibody titres. It was found that a pre-immunisation response to seasonal beta-HCoVs and a high frequency of peripheral intermediate and non-classical monocytes predicted low SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titres. In contrast, an elevated T cell response as measured by IFNγ ELISpot predicted high IgG titres. Additional predictors of clinical protection and low SARS-CoV-2 burden included a high abundance of peripheral T cells. In contrast, increased numbers of intermediate monocytes predicted clinical pathology and high viral burden in the throat. We also conclude that an immunisation strategy that minimises pathology post-challenge did not necessarily mediate viral control. This would be an important finding to take forward into the development of future vaccines aimed at limiting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These results contribute to SARS-CoV-2 CoP definition and shed light on the factors influencing the success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health challenge. Severe cases often respond poorly to standard treatments, highlighting the necessity for novel therapeutic targets and early predictive biomarkers. Methods We utilized flow cytometry to analyze peripheral immune cells from healthy, bacterial pneumonia patients, and COVID-19 patients. The expansion of activated T cells (CD38+HLA-DR+), monocytes, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were detected and correlated with clinical outcomes to evaluate prognostic potential. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to characterize the critical cell subset associated with prognosis and elucidate its phenotype in COVID-19. Results We revealed a significant increase in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells in non-survivor COVID-19 patients, establishing them as an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality. The scRNA-seq analysis identified the CD38+HLA-DR+ T cell as a terminally differentiated, Treg-like subset exhibiting both activation and exhaustion characteristics. This subset presented the highest IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels among all T-cell subsets. Further functional analysis demonstrated its enhanced major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) cross-signaling and correspondingly enriched cytoskeletal rearrangement processes. In addition, there was dysregulated NAD+ metabolism in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells via scRNA-seq, accompanied by elevated adenosine and decreased NAD+ levels in serums from COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We identified the selective expansion of CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells as a novel prognostic indicator for COVID-19 outcomes. These cells’ unique activated-exhausted phenotype, along with their impact on NAD+ metabolism, provides new insights into COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is characterized by persistent symptoms lasting beyond 12 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying pathomechanims remain poorly understood.


METHODS
We conducted detailed immunological analyses in 47 individuals with PCS, assessed >12 weeks post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and compared them to 25 convalescent controls without symptoms. We performed immune phenotyping of T and B cell subsets, assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific responses using activation-induced marker (AIM) flow cytometry for T cells, and tetramer staining of spike-specific B cells. Cytokine levels in peptide-stimulated cell supernatants and plasma were quantified using a Luminex platform.


RESULTS
PCS individuals exhibited reduced frequencies of AIM+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (OX40+, PDL1+) and CD8 T cells (CD137+, CD69+) following petide stimulation with S- or N-Antigen, accompanied by diminished IFNγ and IL2 as measured in the cell culture supernatants. In contrast, non-virus specific T cell populations, including their memory differentiation, activation and helper cell differentiation status did not differ between the groups. PCS individuals showed a significant increase in total (CD19+) and activated B cells (CD86+, HLA-DR+), but not in SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cells (∼0.2% of total B cells). Plasma cytokine analysis revealed elevated markers associated with vascular damage and inflammation in PCS individuals.


CONCLUSION
Persistent immune disturbances in individuals with PCS are characterized by reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, increased B cell activation, and altered inflammatory and vascular biomarkers. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of PCS and may contribute to biomarker discovery and therapeutic development.Trialnumber: DRKS00030974registry's URL: https://www.bfarm.de/EN/BfArM/Tasks/German-Clinical-Trials-Register/_node.html.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astroviruses are a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans and have been linked to fatal cases of encephalitis. A major barrier to the study of human-infecting astroviruses is the lack of an in vivo model as previous attempts failed to identify a host that supports viral replication. We describe a novel murine model of infection using astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1), an astrovirus with high seroprevalence in humans. VA1 is cardiotropic, and viral RNA levels peak in the heart tissue 7 days post-inoculation in multiple different murine genetic backgrounds. Infectious VA1 particles could be recovered from heart tissue 3 and 5 days post-inoculation. Viral capsid was detected intracellularly in the heart tissue by immunostaining, and viral RNA was detected in cardiac myocytes, endocardium, and endothelial cells based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy. Histologically, we identified inflammatory infiltrates consistent with myocarditis in some mice, with viral RNA colocalizing with the infiltrates. These foci contained CD3 +T cells and CD68 +macrophages. Viral RNA levels increased by >10 fold in the heart tissue or serum samples from Rag1 or Stat1 knockout mice, demonstrating the role of both adaptive and innate immunity in the response to VA1 infection. Based on the in vivo tropisms, we tested cardiac-derived primary cells and determined that VA1 can replicate in primary human cardiac endothelial cells, suggesting a novel cardiovascular tropism in human cells. This novel in vivo model of a human-infecting astrovirus enables further characterization of the host immune response and reveals a new cardiovascular tropism of astroviruses. IMPORTANCE Astroviruses routinely cause infections in humans; however, few methods were available to study these viruses. Here, we describe the first animal system to study human-infecting astroviruses by using mice. We demonstrate that mice are susceptible to astrovirus VA1, a strain that commonly infects humans and has been linked to fatal brain infections. The virus infects the heart tissue and is associated with inflammation. When mice with impaired immune systems were infected with VA1, they were found to have higher amounts of the virus in their hearts and blood. We found that VA1 can infect cells from human blood vessels of the heart, which is associated with human health. This model will enable us to better understand how astroviruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. Our findings also suggest that astroviruses could be linked to cardiovascular diseases, including in humans.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause a variety of post-acute sequelae including Long COVID19 (LC), a complex, multisystem disease characterized by a broad range of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive impairment, and post-exertional malaise. The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 (~4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.">

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has significantly affected global health, with severe inflammatory responses leading to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in the modulation of immune responses, but their involvement in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and senescence remains unclear. Triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cell-1 (TREM-1) are myeloid cell receptors that amplify inflammation, described as a biomarker of the severity and mortality of COVID-19. This study investigated the composition and effects of macrophage-derived EVs stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 (MφV-EVs) on the recipient cell response. Our results, for the first time, show that SARS-CoV-2 stimulation modifies the cargo profile of MφV-EVs, enriching them with TREM-1 and miRNA-155 association, along with MMP-9 and IL-8/CXCL8. These EVs carry senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components, promote cellular senescence, and compromise antibacterial defenses upon internalization. Our findings provide evidence that MφV-EVs are key drivers of inflammation and immune dysfunction, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive, human-specific commensal infectious pathogen, poses a significant global health threat, especially in children under five, often resulting in fatalities. The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) remain elusive, necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single-cell resolution. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals. We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset, with significant relative increases in platelets, neutrophils, and their precursors, alongside relative decreases in natural killer (NK) cells, T cell subtypes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up-regulation of neutrophils-related immune genes across multiple immune cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells and B cells, suggesting excessive neutrophil activation. However, a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients. This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxity were down-regulated in both NK cells and T cells, alongside impaired T cell activation. Notably, distinct B cell subtypes, including unique naïve B cell clusters, demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM. The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.">

        <tr id="Differences in immune profiles of children and adults with COVID-19 have been previously described. However, no systematic studies have been reported from infants hospitalized with severe disease. We applied a multidimensional approach to decipher the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected infants (n = 26; 10 subacute, 11 moderate and 5 severe disease; median age = 1.6 months) and matched controls (n = 14; median age = 2 months). Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISGhi) state including: (i) CD14+ monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISGhi naive CD4+ T cells, (iii) ISGhi proliferating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and (iv) ISGhi naive and transitional B cells. We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.">

        <tr id="Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is associated with milder COVID-19 symptoms than previous strains. This study analyzed alterations in natural killer (NK) cell-associated immunity dynamics in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases during the Omicron phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients aged ≥16 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hospitalized at Tottori University Hospital between January 2022 and May 2022. A total of 27 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 11 and 16 were diagnosed with mild and moderate COVID-19, respectively, based on the Japanese COVID-19 clinical practice guideline. Peripheral blood NK cell subsets and surface markers, including the activating receptor NKG2D and the inhibitory receptor TIGIT, as well as serum levels of 24 immunoregulatory markers, such as cytokines and cytotoxic mediators, were measured at admission and recovery. In addition, to explore immune patterns associated with disease severity, differences in 24 serum markers and soluble UL16-binding protein 2 (sULBP2) at the clinically most symptomatic time point during hospitalization were visualized using a volcano plot and analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Results Patients with mild COVID-19 exhibited expanded subsets of unconventional CD56dimCD16- NK cells with elevated NKG2D expression and lower levels of cytotoxic mediators (granzyme A, granzyme B, and granulysin). In contrast, patients with moderate disease exhibited NK cell exhaustion, characterized by upregulation of TIGIT, along with increased levels of NK cell-associated cytokines and cytotoxic mediators. The volcano plot identified that the patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed that IL-6, IFN-γ, soluble Fas, and CXCL8 were correlated with increased sULBP2. The PCA identified distinct clusters based on disease severity. Conclusions The results of study highlight the differences in NK cell-associated immune alterations between mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. Elevated IL-6 and sULBP2 levels, along with their correlations with inflammatory mediators, reflects differences in immune response based on disease severity. These findings provide insight into the immune response to infection caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and improve our understanding of its immunological features.">

        <tr id="Background The symptomatic and immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination of people with Long COVID are poorly characterized. Methods In this prospective study, we evaluated changes in symptoms and immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination in 16 vaccine-naïve individuals with Long COVID. Surveys were administered before vaccination and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after receiving the first vaccine dose of the primary series. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCR enrichment, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, antibody responses to other viral and self-antigens, and circulating cytokines were quantified before vaccination and at 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. Results At 12 weeks post-vaccination, self-reported improved health is seen in 10 out of 16 participants, 3 have no change, and 3 have worse health although 2 report transient improvement after vaccination. One participant reporting worse health was hospitalized twice with chest pain (after each dose). Symptom outcomes are most associated with plasma biosignatures. Higher baseline sIL-6R is associated with symptom improvement, and stably elevated levels of IFN-β and CNTF are associated with no improvement. Significant elevation in SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs and spike protein-specific IgG are observed at 6 and 12 weeks after vaccination. No changes in reactivities are observed against herpes viruses and self-antigens. Conclusions In this study of 16 people with Long COVID, vaccination is associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific IgG and T cell expansion in most participants. Specific immune features are associated with symptom change after vaccination and most participants experience improved health or no change following vaccination.">

        <tr id="The Global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 was initiated by the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In addition to conventional pulmonary lesions, a range of neurological injury symptoms have been identified in clinical practice, but the aetiology of neurological disorders linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains poorly understood. Syrian hamsters, which are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, exhibit a disease phenotype similar to that observed in human COVID-19 patients. In this study, a hamster model of COVID-19 infection was used to analyze molecular changes in different tissues at various time points post infection with distinct strains using proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches. Multi-omics analysis showed that SARS-COV-2 infection triggers sustained downregulation of the abundance and phosphorylation levels of neuronal and synapse-associated proteins in the brain, suggesting that neuronal damage persists even during the recovery period. Additionally, infections with SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the onset of long-term symptoms of COVID-19 by impacting energy metabolism, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission pathways.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on global health, with nearly 800 million cases reported in the Americas alone. The clinical presentation of the disease is highly variable, with approximately half of all patients experiencing severe symptoms. This variability confounds the complex interplay between immune responses and disease severity. Severe cases are often characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. Over 88% of COVID-19 patients have multiple comorbidities; factors such as age and pre-existing conditions further modulate immune responses and contribute to the severity of the disease. While some studies have reported differences in cytokine profiles between severity groups, larger, well-designed cohorts are needed to clarify these relationships. Natural Killer cells, which are critical for the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2, are often impaired and contribute to immune exhaustion. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 evades innate immune defenses through accessory proteins that inhibit interferon signaling and exacerbate cytokine storms and inflammation. This integrative review aims to synthesize findings from 2020 onward and provide insights into the innate immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and their contributions to disease pathogenesis. Understanding cytokine dynamics, NK cell behaviors, and viral immune evasion strategies is critical for advancing therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally; however, the characterization of molecular biomarkers of severe disease remains of great scientific importance. The aim of this study was to capture the transcriptional differences of the whole blood gene expression between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease, using Next Generation Sequencing technologies, on admission and after 7 days. The genes which were differentially expressed in severe compared to mild patients were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gene expression data were used to estimate the cell abundance of 22 immune cell types via digital cytometry. GO terms related to the response to molecules of bacterial origin, such as intestine-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were enriched, among other dysregulated pathways, which are well described as paramount mechanisms of severe manifestations of COVID-19. The neutrophil population increased in patients with severe disease, whereas the monocyte, CD8+ T cell, and activated Natural Killer (NK) cell populations were depleted. These cell population dynamics are also indicative of severe COVID-19 and intestinal bacterial translocation. This study elucidates the molecular basis of severe COVID-19 and highlights intestinal bacterial translocation as a potential driver of severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological issues, including cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 survivors. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19, is also a risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation in COVID-19 patients, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD. SARS-CoV-2 also induces cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We hypothesized that eNOS deficiency would worsen neuroinflammation, senescence, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and hypercoagulability in eNOS-deficient mice. Six-month-old eNOS+/− (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and wild-type (WT) male mice were infected with mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2. Mice were evaluated for weight loss, viral load, and markers of inflammation and senescence 3 days post-infection. eNOS+/− mice showed more weight loss (~15%) compared to WT mice (~5%) and increased inflammatory markers (Ccl2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, IL-1β, and IL-6) and senescence markers (p53 and p21). They also exhibited higher microglial activation (Iba1) and increased plasma coagulation and BBB permeability, despite comparable lung viral loads and absence of virus in the brain. This is the first experimental evidence demonstrating that eNOS deficiency exacerbates SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidity, neuroinflammation, and brain senescence, linking eNOS to COVID-19-related neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Cellular immune responses are crucial in determining outcomes of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Ineffective immune responses enable persistent HBV infection and contribute to progressive liver disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying immunological HBV tolerance and restoring functional adaptive immune responses is essential for successful chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment. This study examined the dysregulated immune responses and immunopathological cell states associated with CHB using single‐cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to investigate immune cell composition and transcriptional differences between patients with CHB and healthy donors. Phenotypic alterations in the lymphoid and myeloid compartments were observed following HBV infection. T cell immune profiling in patients with CHB showed enrichment of exhausted CD8+ T cells, impaired cytotoxicity of effector CD8+ T cells, and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) suppressive activity. Immature neutrophils and a unique CD14+ monocyte subset (myeloid‐derived suppressor cells) exhibited potent immunosuppressive abilities. A novel population of CD14+CD163+VSIG4+ M2‐like macrophages with immunosuppressive and anti‐inflammatory phenotypes was enriched in a patient with severe CHB and liver failure, indicating a potential contribution to dysfunctional immune responses. Our study demonstrated immune exhaustion and evasion in chronic HBV infection, elucidating its immunopathological features and suggesting new therapeutic strategies for immune‐mediated disorders and unresolved chronic HBV infection.">

        <tr id="With the concurrent circulations of SARS-CoV-2 omicron and influenza A viruses in the community, there is evidence showing co-infection with both viruses. However, disease severity may vary due to the complex immunity landscape of the patients and the neutralizing antibody waning status. The intrinsic dynamic relationship and pathological significance for such co-infections remain largely unknown. The replication kinetics and innate immune responses from the co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron BA.1 and D614G variant) and influenza A viruses (pandemic H1N1, seasonal H3N2 and highly pathogenic avian H5N1) were characterized in human respiratory tissue explants, human airway, and alveolar epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 reduced the replication of influenza A viruses, but not vice versa, during co-infections in human bronchial tissues and airway epithelial cells. In lung tissues, the co-infections showed minimal effects on each other, but the viral replications of the two viruses were mutually reduced except for H1N1pdm in the alveolar epithelial cells irrespective of the enhancement of the ACE2 receptor. Notably, the co-infections showed a significant upregulation of the innate immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to single infections in both respiratory epithelial cells, suggesting that co-infections of influenza A viruses potentially lead to more severe damage to the host than SARS-CoV-2 single infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite over 13 billion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses administered globally, persistent post-vaccination symptoms, termed post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome (PCVS), resemble post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Symptoms like cardiac, vascular, and neurological issues often emerge shortly after vaccination and persist for months to years, mirroring PASC. We previously showed the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein persists in CD16+ monocytes after infection, potentially driving PASC. Approved vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, AstraZeneca) deliver synthetic S1 to elicit immunity, suggesting a shared mechanism. We hypothesized that vaccine-derived S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes sustains inflammation akin to PASC, contributing to PCVS. We studied 50 individuals with PCVS symptoms lasting over 30 days post-vaccination and 26 asymptomatic controls, using (1) machine learning-based immune profiling to compare cytokine signatures with PASC, (2) flow cytometry to detect S1 in CD16+ monocytes, and (3) LC-MS to confirm S1 across vaccine types. We correlated S1 persistence with symptom duration and inflammation. Prior infection was excluded via clinical history, anti-nucleocapsid antibody tests, and T-detect assays, though definitive tests are lacking. Preliminary findings suggest S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes and an associated inflammatory profile may contribute to PCVS. Further studies are needed to confirm causality and prevalence.">

        <tr id="Objectives To evaluate the immune persistence and cross-immune response of elderly individuals after Omicron BA.5 infections. Method The neutralizing antibodies against WT, BA.5, XBB.1 and EG.5 strains were analyzed. The T/B-cell subsets’ responses were tested through intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Results The neutralizing antibodies titers against WT and BA.5 strain, remaining high level for at least 6 months, were higher than that of both XBB.1 and EG.5 variants. The neutralizing antibodies of WT, BA.5, XBB.1, and EG.5 strains in the elderly were slightly lower than those in middle-age. The memory B cells decreased rapidly in the elderly, and Tfh, Th17 cells of the elderly continued to increase for only 3 months, while Tfh and Th17 cells increased in the middle-aged for over 6 months. For the elderly, after peptide stimulation, unswitched/switched memory B cells decreased, while double negative B cells displayed higher proliferation. The proportions of both naïve and Temra cells in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells declined, whereas those of Tcm and Tem cells elevated. In the meantime, both CD69+ and CD38+ T cells decreased, but the frequencies of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed an increasing trend. The proportions of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ cells also increased in older people with long COVID symptoms at 3m post-infection. Conclusions Omicron BA.5 infection induced lower neutralizing antibodies against XBB.1 and EG.5 variant. The decrease of memory B cells, CD69+ and CD38+T cells, as well as the increase of PD-1+, CTLA-4+ of CD4+/CD8+T cells and double negative B cells, indicate that sustained immune responses against BA.5 infection may wane more rapidly in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Background Despite the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in reducing mortality and severe cases of COVID-19, a proportion of survivors experience long-term symptoms, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This study investigates the long-term immunological and neurodegenerative effects associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods 13 Controls and 20 COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, were recruited. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in both plasma and EVs. A deep-immunophenotyping of monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) was performed, along with immunostainings of SARS-CoV-2 in the colon. Results Higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilaments were found in EVs but not in plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon. Conclusions COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC. The cargo of EVs can be a promising tool for early detection of virus-induced neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Introduction A hallmark of many lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) is the alteration of immune responses, often starting before the onset of clinical disease. The present study aimed to investigate how GM1 gangliosidosis impacted the course of an acute central nervous system (CNS) virus infection before the clinical onset of LSD. Methods For this purpose, Glb1 -/- and wildtype control mice (both C57BL/6 background) were intracerebrally infected with the BeAn strain of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) at the age of 5 weeks and sacrificed 4, 7, 14 and 98 days post infection, respectively. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry was used to assess viral load and immune cell activation and infiltration. Results Both wildtype and Glb1 -/- mice were able to clear the virus from the CNS and did not develop any clinical symptoms of TMEV-associated disease, thus indicating no overt alteration in susceptibility to TMEV infection. However, in the early phase post infection, Glb1 -/- mice displayed a slightly delayed T cell response as well as an increase in the number and activation of CNS microglia. Discussion These results suggest that already in the early stage of disease (before clinical onset) GM1 gangliosidosis causes an impaired T cell response and microglial hyperreactivity.">

        <tr id="Neurological symptoms involving the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) are common complications of acute COVID-19 as well as post-COVID conditions. Most research into these neurological sequalae focuses on the CNS, disregarding the PNS. Guinea pigs were previously shown to be useful models of disease during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic. However, their suitability for studying SARS-CoV-2 has not been experimentally demonstrated. To assess the suitability of guinea pigs as models for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the PNS, and to determine routes of CNS invasion through the PNS, we intranasally infected wild-type Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs with ancestral SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. We assessed PNS sensory neurons (trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia), autonomic neurons (superior cervical ganglia), brain regions (olfactory bulb, brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus), lungs, and blood for viral RNA (RT-qPCR), protein (immunostaining), and infectious virus (plaque assay) at three- and six-days post infection. We show that guinea pigs, which have previously been used as a model of SARS-CoV-1 pulmonary disease, are not susceptible to intranasal infection with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, and are not useful models in assessing neurological impacts of infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the early pandemic.">

        <tr id="During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the major entry receptor for the virus and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as an important SARS-CoV-2 entry factor. Previous studies investigating the impact of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in adults have yielded inconsistent results, thereby underscoring the need for further research in this domain. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from infected adults during the acute and late convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the expression of both genes with non-infected household member contacts. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression is temporarily reduced during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection presumably due to viral disruption of transcription. Post-recovery, however, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was comparable to non-infected household contacts. The lack of significant differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression between SARS-CoV-2-positive adults and uninfected household controls suggests that factors influencing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults may extend beyond ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the study’s limited sample size and the heterogeneity of COVID-19 cases. Other non-physiological factors, such as enhanced hygiene practices following the infection of a household member, may also contribute to absence of infection among healthy controls.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the diminishing global impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus continues to circulate and undergo mutations, posing ongoing challenges for public health. A comprehensive understanding of virus entry mechanisms is crucial for managing new epidemic strains. However, the cellular processes post-endocytosis remain largely unexplored. This study employs proximity labeling to examine proteins near ACE2 post-viral infection and identified syntaxin-6 (STX6) as a factor that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by impeding the endocytic release of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances early endosome recruitment of STX6. STX6 appears to hinder the maturation of viral particles-laden early endosomes into late endosomes, from which the virus could escape. Instead, it promotes the trafficking of the virus toward the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. STX6 exhibits a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 variants and several other viruses that enter via endocytosis. We report for the first time the function of STX6 as a restrictive factor in viral infection. IMPORTANCE Virus entry is the first step of the virus life cycle, and the exploitation of the endo-lysosome pathway for cellular entry by viruses has been well documented. Meanwhile, the intrinsic defense present within cells interferes with virus entry. We identified STX6 as a host restriction factor for viral entry by facilitating the virus trafficking to the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. Notably, STX6 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants and other viruses employing endocytosis for entry.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease acquired through tick bites. We have previously demonstrated the correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. In the current study, our clinical observation study establishes a strong correlation between elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA and poor prognosis. In vivo studies further reveal endothelial cells as an important source responsible for releasing mtDNA into circulation, which promotes B cell activation, migration, and differentiation via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Notably, TLR9 activation enhances B-cell susceptibility to SFTSV infection. These findings suggest that mtDNA released by injured endothelial cells facilitates B cell differentiation and virus replication, emphasizing the significant role of mitochondrial damage within endothelial cells in contributing to the severity of SFTS outcomes. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new acute tick-borne infectious disease with a high fatality rate of 10%–50%. There is a strong correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. Our research has revealed the crucial role of mtDNA in predicting the prognosis of SFTS and its impact on vascular endothelial injuries as well as B cell differentiation, two previously unexplored features of SFTSV infection. Moreover, mtDNA could activate the TLR9 signal to induce plasmablast differentiation in B cells and promote SFTSV infection. This study provides valuable mechanistic and clinical insights into the adverse outcomes associated with SFTSV infection.

        <tr id="Mitochondrial diseases (MtD) represent a significant public health challenge due to their heterogenous clinical presentation, often severe and progressive symptoms, and lack of effective therapies. Environmental exposures, such bacterial and viral infection, can further compromise mitochondrial function and exacerbate the progression of MtD. However, the underlying immune alterations that enhance immunopathology in MtD remain unclear. Here we employ in vitro and in vivo approaches to clarify the molecular and cellular basis for innate immune hyperactivity in models of polymerase gamma (Polg)-related MtD. We reveal that type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated upregulation of caspase-11 and guanylate-binding proteins (GBP) increase macrophage sensing of the opportunistic microbe Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in Polg mutant mice. Furthermore, we show that excessive cytokine secretion and activation of pyroptotic cell death pathways contribute to lung inflammation and morbidity after infection with PA. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for understanding innate immune dysregulation in MtD and reveals potential targets for limiting infection- and inflammation-related complications in Polg-related MtD.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for immune evasion. While initial studies focused on the Wuhan variant and adaptive immunity, later emerging strains such as Omicron exhibit mutations that may alter their immune-modulatory properties. We performed a comprehensive review of immune evasion mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to focus on the evolutionary dynamics of immune modulation. We systematically analyzed and compared the impact of all currently known Wuhan and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 proteins on type I interferon (IFN) responses using a dual-luciferase reporter assay carrying an interferon-inducible promoter. Results revealed that Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp14, and ORF6 are potent type I IFN inhibitors conserved across Wuhan and Omicron strains. Notably, we identified strain-specific differences, with Nsp6 and Spike proteins exhibiting enhanced IFN suppression in Omicron, whereas the Envelope protein largely retained this function. To extend these findings, we investigated selected proteins in primary human endothelial cells and also observed strain-specific differences in immune response with higher type I IFN response in cells expressing the Wuhan strain variant, suggesting that Omicron’s adaptational mutations may contribute to a damped type I IFN response in the course of the pandemic’s trajectory.">

 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe postinfectious complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Although the crucial pathogenic role of the monocyte compartment is known, information regarding the mechanisms and maintenance of the inflammatory trigger is lacking. Genetic variants in the OAS/RNase L pathway, involved in viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing and the modulation of inflammatory responses, have been identified in patients with MIS-C. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, including the study of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, blood biomarkers, and autoantibodies, as well as transcriptomic and proteomic profiling.



 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, and RNA samples from MIS-C patients were analyzed. PBMCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and inflammatory responses were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC). Apoptosis was assessed via annexin V staining. Type I interferon (IFN) signatures were measured using qPCR. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated using an automated ELISA system (ELLA). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed through bioinformatics pipelines, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), while proteomics data were processed using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA).



 We found a monocyte exhaustion phenotype, demonstrated by reduced inflammasome activation in response to stimuli and an associated lack of IL-1β secretion (Figure 1A-B). Intriguingly, dsRNA was detected in monocytes from MIS-C patients even during follow-up, suggesting a long-lasting viral presence that could drive sustained immune activation (Figure 1C-D). Blood biomarker profiling, bulk RNA-seq, and proteomic analyses revealed a signature characterized by the activation of genes involved in antiviral response, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation pathways. Additionally, we observed anti-IL1RA autoantibodies in 40-50% of patients, consistent with previous reports.

(A) In vitro inflammatory cytokine secretion by MIS-C patients’ PBMCs (T1: 0 to 10 days from onset, T2: 10 to 30 days from onset, and T3: over 30 days from onset) of as measured in culture supernatant after 18 hours with or without stimulation with the indicated stimuli. The NLRP3 blocker MCC950 inhibited secretion, indicating that secretion of IL-1β is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome. (B) Percentages of spontaneous and after ASC specks detection in monocytes (left) and after stimulation (LPS+ATP, right) from controls (HD), MIS-C patients in acute stage (T1), and during follow-up (T2-3) by flow cytometry.

Data are expressed as median ± IQR. *P < .05, **P < .01, ***P < .005, ****P < .001 as assessed by Mann–Whitney t test.



 Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of immune dysregulation in MIS-C, encompassing monocyte exhaustion, persistence of intramonocytic dsRNA, autoantibody formation, and a distinct transcriptomic and proteomic signature. This study provides insights into the underlying mechanisms driving sustained inflammation in post-COVID syndromes.

        <tr id="Background: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection results in persistent liver inflammation, which ultimately leads to liver fibrosis and increases the risk of cirrhosis. Recruitment of circulating monocytes to the liver is an essential aspect that exacerbates liver fibrosis; however, the mechanism underlying their dysregulation, which contributes to this progression, remains unclear. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to characterize the landscape of circulating monocytes from patients with CHB and liver fibrosis (CHB group) and healthy controls (HC group). Conventional techniques were performed to validate the findings. Results: Monocytes significantly expanded in the CHB group. The proto-oncogene LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) was highly expressed in monocytes from the CHB group, which may be associated with their expansion. In addition, we noticed that a classical monocyte subcluster surged in the CHB group and highly expressed platelet-related genes such as ITGA2B, which was identified as monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPA). The frequency of MPA was significantly higher in the CHB group, positively associated with platelet and white blood cell, and negatively associated with liver fibroscan and age, which indicates that MPA may play an important role in liver inflammation in the early liver fibrosis stage. Moreover, we found that MPA displays the enrichment of chemokine signaling-associated genes, such as C-C chemokine motif ligand 5 (CCL5﻿), and showed an increased adhesion capacity to endothelial cells. After incubation with MPA cell supernatants, pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-8 and IL-1β were upregulated in LX-2 cells, which were reversed by the addition of anti-CCL5 antibodies. Conclusions: Our data suggest that enhanced LMO2﻿﻿﻿ expression in circulating monocytes may be associated with their expansion, and an increased MPA subset may participate in liver fibrosis progression. These results provide valuable insights into the etiology of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB.">

 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly burdened global public health. However, the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 within the human body remains not fully understood. In this review, we overview the literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection across various human organs and tissues. We summarize the relevant specimen types, techniques for examining SARS-CoV-2 tropism, and findings at both organ/tissue and cellular levels. To systematically evaluate the evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 tissue tropism, we establish a hierarchical classification system based on two key criteria: (1) specimen origin and (2) detection methodology. Clinical specimens obtained directly from COVID-19 patients provide the most definitive evidence, whereas organoid-derived specimens and animal models indicate potential infectivity under artificial conditions. In terms of detection methods, we prioritize viral particle identification over viral protein or RNA detection, as the latter requires further confirmation to establish productive infection. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 potentially targets multiple human organ systems, including the respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, pancreas, small intestine, liver, and salivary glands. By contrast, viral tropism for the central nervous system and the reproductive system remains uncertain and requires further validation. At the cellular level, we identify specific target cell types vulnerable to infection, including ciliated epithelial cells, alveolar type II pneumocytes, enterocytes, cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, and pancreatic acinar cells. Furthermore, we analyze the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor distribution patterns and viral tropism, as well as potential variations in tissue specificity among different viral variants. We expect this review to provide a comprehensive landscape of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and enhance our understanding of the life cycle and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the human body.

        <tr id="Mastitis remains the most prevalent and costly disease to dairy producers. Granulocytes are the primary host innate immune cell responders during infectious mastitis. Here we examine three mid-lactation Holsteins challenged with ~ 150 CFU of Staphylococcus aureus (Newbould) that developed chronic mastitis as assessed by bacteria and somatic cell counts in a single quarter. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of blood and milk cells identified immune cell populations of interest from both tissues, and the proportion of cell types recovered via scRNA-seq were highly similar to those recovered via flow cytometry. Granulocytes were the predominating cell type in both blood and milk samples; however granulocytes identified via scRNA-seq revealed several clusters comprised primarily of milk-derived cells. Milk-enriched granulocyte clusters were further investigated to identify gene signatures indicative of the granulocyte-specific localized immune responses in the mammary gland during chronic mastitis infection. Biological process enrichment analysis of gene signatures further revealed relevant networks such as granulocyte migration, myeloid cell differentiation, and inflammatory responses. In total, the work describes the immune landscape occurring at both peripheral and local sites of cattle with mastitis and identified important granulocyte-specific features of the localized immune response occurring during chronic infection.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 leads to irregularities in immune response regulation and is believed to contribute to autoimmune diseases, highlighting a significant link between viral infections and autoimmune diseases. This connection arises from the molecular and immunological interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the host. Autoimmunity can be triggered by various factors that create an overly stimulated immune system. The virus activates both innate and adaptive immunity, which can result in disease progression. COVID-19 disrupts normal antiviral immunity and plays a role in the onset of autoimmune diseases. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, including molecular mimicry, bystander activation of T-cells, transient immunosuppression, and inflammation. Additionally, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may also provoke autoimmunity. In this review, we explore the various factors through which SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to autoimmune diseases, aiming to minimize the risk of developing such conditions following COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.">

        <tr id="Background Long-COVID immunopathogenesis involves diverse factors. We longitudinally characterize hospitalized COVID-19 patients, examining the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and inflammation in immune dysregulation. Methods Hospitalized patients are evaluated during acute infection (T0), 3 months post-symptom onset (T1), and 3 years if symptoms persisted (T2). Immune profile includes characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-specific T/B cells (flow cytometry) and antibodies (ELISA, neutralization, ADCC). RNAemia and cytokines are quantified (RT-PCR, cytometric beads array) and correlated. Statistics: non-parametric cross-sectional, longitudinal and correlation analyses. Results Here we show 48 hospitalized individuals during acute COVID-19, 38 exhibit early persistent symptoms (EPS+) 3 months post-symptoms onset, 10 do not (EPS−). Groups are comparable for age, sex, co-morbidities. The EPS+ shows fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia/dysgeusia, diarrhea, chronic pain, mnestic disorders. Over time, they show a reduction of neutralization ability and total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, with increased total CD4 TEMRA, and failure to increase RBD-specific B cells and IgA+ MBCs. EPS+ patients show higher levels of T0-IFN-γ + CD4 TEMRA, T1-IL-2 + CD4 TEM and T1-TNF-α + CD4 cTfh. In EPS+, baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positively correlates with CD4 TEMRA, follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with ADCC. Among 38 EPS+ individuals at T1, 33 are evaluated 3 years after infection, 5 are lost at follow-up. 10/33 EPS+ show long-term symptoms (late persistent symptoms, EPS + LPS+), whereas 23/33 fully recover (EPS + LPS−). Antibodies, RNAemia, and cytokines show no differences between/within groups at any time point. Conclusions Early persistent symptoms are associated with multi-layered SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune dysregulation. The shift towards non-Ag-specific TEMRA and ADCC trigger in EPS+ may relate to SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Early immune dysregulation does not associate with long-term persistent symptoms. Further research on SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and early immune dysregulation is needed.">

        <tr id="Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) presents an emerging public threat due to its high mortality rate and ever‐expanding geographic distribution. However, characterization of SFTSV infection pathogenesis and immunological impact at single‐cell level remains underexplored. Here, we employ single‐cell transcriptome‐wide sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hospitalized SFTSV‐infected patients to map the immune landscape across acute and convalescent stages of infection. The results reveal significant alterations in immune cell compositions, along with profound disruption in intercellular crosstalk. B cells and neutrophils appear to be the primary target for SFTSV infection besides monocytes, as evidenced by heightened virus‐related pathways in these two cell types during the acute phase. In addition, SFTSV infection induces a substantial inflammatory response, which were prominently reflected in monocytes and neutrophils. These data illustrate the complex immune remodeling and inflammatory cascades triggered by SFTSV, with a particular focus on its effects on B cells and neutrophils, bringing novel insights into future therapeutic developments.">

        <tr id="Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae (PASC). However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts the brain and leads to persistent behavioral changes remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces neuroinflammation and microglial activation, leading to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice. Methods: We established a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model using the virulent SARS2-N501YMA30 strain to investigate its impact on the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed neuroinvasion via immunostaining of dsRNA and markers for neuronal, astrocyte, and microglia in brain slices. Behavioral changes were evaluated at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4 months post-infection. Molecular and cellular analyses included bulk RNA-seq, Golgi-Cox staining, field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess gene expression, neuronal morphology, and microglial activation in the brain. Results: We demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral assays indicated a marked elevation in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors post-infection. A comparative analysis of RNA expression profiles disclosed alterations in the post-infected brains. Additionally, we observed dendritic spine remodeling on neurons within the amygdala after infection. Infection with SARS2-N501YMA30 was associated with microglial activation and a subsequent increase in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion plays a critical role in the development of lasting behavioral sequelae observed in PASC. These data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.">

        <tr id="Background Immune-related myocarditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a rare immune-related adverse event (irAE) but is characterized by a high mortality rate. However, the specific pathological mechanisms underlying immune-related myocarditis remain largely unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the inflammatory microenvironment within cardiac tissues affected by immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on an endomyocardial biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma who developed immune-related myocarditis following treatment with ICIs. Additionally, the scRNA-seq data of heart specimens from deceased donors without cardiovascular diseases were collected and applied as normal control. To validate our findings and assess their specificity to ICI-related pathology, we analyzed mouse scRNA-seq data, including controls, ICI-related myocarditis, viral myocarditis, and autoimmune myocarditis. Results We found elevated proportions of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts in the irAE group, suggesting an intensified inflammatory microenvironment in human immune-related myocarditis. Within the lymphocyte compartment, increased proportions of CD8 + T exhausted cells and CD8 + T proliferative cells were observed in the irAE group. The upregulated differentially expressed genes in myeloid cells in the irAE group were enriched in pro-inflammatory pathways, consistent with the observed metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. CXCL9 + fibroblasts, characterized by the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and enriched in the JAK-STAT and TNFα signaling pathways, were predominantly found in the irAE group. Venous endothelial cells specifically expressing atypical chemokine receptor-1 (ACKR1) interacted with myeloid cells and CXCL9 + fibroblasts through the CXCL signaling pathway, facilitating chemokine transcytosis and leukocyte recruitment. Analysis of murine scRNA-seq data further supported these findings, revealing that exhausted CD8 + T cells and pro-inflammatory fibroblasts were uniquely enriched in ICI-related myocarditis, reflecting its distinct inflammatory microenvironment. Conclusions We elucidated the unique inflammatory microenvironment of immune-related myocarditis at the single-cell level. Our work revealed key cell subpopulations that were significantly implicated in inflammation, thus offering potential therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Currently, the Omicron variant of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to circulate globally. In our multiplex respiratory pathogen detection, we identified numerous instances of co-infection with Echovirus (ECHO) among Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, which exacerbated the clinical symptoms of these patients. Such co-infections are likely to impact the subsequent medical treatment. To date, there are no reports on the pathogenic mechanisms related to COVID-19 co-infected with ECHO. Therefore, this study employed the TM Widely-Targeted metabolomics approach to analyze the serum metabolomes of COVID-19 patients with single SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), COVID-19 patients co-infected with ECHO (COVID-19  +  ECHO), and healthy individuals (Control) recruited from routine physical examinations during the same period. Concurrent clinical laboratory tests were performed on the patients to reveal the differences in metabolomic characteristics between the COVID-19 patients and the COVID-19  +  ECHO patients, as well as to explore potential metabolic pathways that may exacerbate disease progression. Our findings indicate that both clinical examination indicators and the pathways enriched by differential metabolites confirm that patients with dual infection exhibit higher inflammatory and immune responses compared to those with single COVID-19 infections. This difference is likely reflected through abnormalities in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, with the metabolite Sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine playing a crucial role in this process. Finally, we established a diagnostic model based on logistic regression using five differential metabolites, which accurately differentiates between the dual infection population and the single COVID-19 infection population (AUC = 0.828).">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected hundreds of millions of people globally, resulting in millions of deaths. During this pandemic, children have demonstrated greater resistance than adults, exhibiting lower infection rates, reduced mortality, and milder symptoms. Summarizing the differences in resistance between children and adults during COVID-19 can provide insights into protective mechanisms and potential implications for future treatments. In this review, we focused on summarizing and discussing the mechanisms for better protection of children in COVID-19. These protective mechanisms encompass several factors: the baseline expression of cell surface receptor ACE2 and hydrolase TMPRSS2, the impact of complications on COVID-19, and age-related cytokine profiles. Additionally, differences in local and systemic immune responses between children and adults also contribute significantly, particularly interferon responses, heterologous protection from non-COVID-19 vaccinations, and immune status variations influenced by micronutrient levels. The advantageous protection mechanisms of these children may provide insights into the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Importantly, while age-related metabolic profiles and differential COVID-19 vaccine responses may contribute to protection in children, current comparative research remains limited and requires further investigation.">

        <tr id="Post-infection sequela of several viruses have been linked with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we investigated whether mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone or in combination with two putative Parkinsonian toxins, MPTP and paraquat, increased the susceptibility to develop Parkinsonian pathology. We also examined if G2019S LRRK2 mice had any change in sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 as well as if vaccination against this virus altered any neuropathology. Infection with WA-1/2020 or Omicron B1.1.529 strains sensitized both WT and G2019S LRRK2 mice to the neuropathological effects of a subtoxic exposure to MPTP, but not paraquat. These neuropathologies were rescued in WT mice vaccinated with mRNA- or protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice were only protected with the protein-based vaccine. These results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of Parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.">

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 was the causing agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in millions of deaths worldwide and massive economic losses. Although there are already several vaccines licensed, as novel variants develop, understanding the immune response induced by vaccination and natural infection is key for the development of future vaccines. Methods: In this study, we have used flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing to assess the longitudinal CD8+ T-cell response against natural infection and vaccination in convalescent and vaccinated individuals, from early activation to immune memory establishment. Moreover, we have characterized the T-cell receptor clonality and diversity at different stages post-infection and post-vaccination. Results: We have found no significant differences in CD8+ T-cell activation during the first three weeks post-infection compared to the first three weeks after first vaccination. Conversely, natural infection resulted in sustained high levels of T-cell activation at four weeks post-infection, a point in which we observed a decline in T-cell activation post-vaccination despite boosting with a second vaccination shot. Moreover, additional vaccination did not result in enhanced T-cell activation. Of note, we have observed variations in the memory subset structure at every stage of disease and vaccination. Overall, both infection and immunization induced a highly diverse T-cell receptor repertoire, which was observed both between study groups and between patients inside a given group. Conclusions: These data contribute to expand our knowledge about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and call for additional strategies to enhance T-cell responses by booster immunization.">

        <tr id="Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition (here abbreviated as post-COVID) is an escalating global health issue. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of post-COVID following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.We analyzed the gene expression profile in PBMCs from 60 middle-aged post-COVID patients and 50 age-matched controls at a median time of 28 months following a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical assessments included intensity of post-COVID symptoms, physical and mental fatigue, depression and anxiety. Sixty-seven participants performed a mild exertion ergometer test with assessment of lactate concentrations. Transcriptome analysis was performed on mRNA selected by poly-A enrichment and SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were analyzed using the ARTIC protocol.We identified 463 differentially expressed transcripts in PBMCs, of which 324 were upregulated and 129 downregulated in post-COVID patients. Upregulated genes in post-COVID individuals were enriched for processes involving JAK-STAT signaling, negative regulation of ubiquitination, IL9 signaling, and negative regulation of viral process, suggesting chronic inflammation. Downregulated genes were enriched for processes involving mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. No SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments were detected in PBMCs of patients with post-COVID and no IFN genes were found differentially expressed in post-COVID patients. Post-COVID was associated with elevated lactate levels in blood, both at rest and after a short recovery phase following exertion, suggesting increased anaerobic activity in skeletal muscles. We did not find differences in the transcriptional profiles or clinical manifestations when comparing patients who contracted the infection from early SARS-CoV-2 variants with those who contracted the infection during the period when the Omicron variant was prevalent.Our findings highlight molecular changes compatible with a persistent immune response in PBMCs of post-COVID subjects at a median follow-up of 28 months after a mild infection, supporting the hypothesis that post-COVID is a chronic inflammatory condition. The upregulation of JAK/STAT signaling suggests a potential therapeutic target in post-COVID.">

We evaluated the clinical manifestations in elderly individuals following coinfections, including complications in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Ultimately, we have summarized the current strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza coinfections in older adults. Through these studies, we aim to reduce the risk of dual infections in elderly individuals and provide a scientific basis for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of age-related viral diseases, thereby improving their health status.">

        <tr id="Identifying immune markers driving early and effective antibody response in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical due to the threat of future coronavirus pandemics, incomplete global vaccination, and suboptimal booster coverage. Patients with life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are characterized by dysregulated thromboinflammation and cytokine storm that could influence the isotype virus-specific antibody response and the subsequent clinical outcome. We investigated the association between COVID-19-related mortality with the dynamics, magnitude, and relative avidity of nucleoprotein (N), spike (S), and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM, IgA, and IgG in circulation. We also assessed the relationship between the virus-specific antibody responses and cytokine patterns, as well as systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation markers. This multicenter study included COVID-19 patients hospitalized early in the pandemic, classified as survivors (n=62) and non-survivors (n=17). We developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to evaluate each virus-specific isotype using well-characterized outpatient COVID-19 (n=180) and pre-pandemic cohorts (n=111). The pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as the regulatory IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNFRI) levels were evaluated. The ELISAs performed highly for all virus-specific isotypes, although modest for IgM-N. Non-survivors increased N-specific, but no S-specific, IgM and IgA responses throughout the disease course and, more notably, a delayed class switching to IgG-S and IgG-RBD compared to survivors. No differences were observed in the virus-specific IgG relative avidity. Survivors exhibited an antibody response proportional to the degree of systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation, whereas non-survivors showed those dissociated because of their uncontrolled severe thromboinflammation. Only the survivors showed a dominant regulatory cytokine pattern in the early phase of infection (<10 days after symptoms onset), which strongly correlated with developing IgG-S and IgG-RBD protective antibodies. We developed easy-to-use immune assays that enable patient monitoring and identify at-risk populations in low- to middle-income regions. Non-survivors displayed an ineffective N-mediated antibody response, marked by an inability to control inflammation and a compromised time-dependent class switching toward S and RBD-specific IgG. The regulatory cytokine axis, including TGF-β1, maybe a critical immune correlate of effective antibody-mediated immunity in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), brought about by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly impacted public health and the economy. A fundamental aspect of addressing this virus lies in elucidating the mechanisms through which it induces disease. Our study reveals that Non-structural protein 6 (NSP6) of SARS-CoV-2 promotes the initiation of autophagy by activating Beclin1. In the later stage of autophagy, however, NSP6 causes a blockage in the autophagy–lysosome degradation via the inhibition of Mucolipin 1 (MLN1). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) L37F in NSP6, which is associated with asymptomatic infection, similarly enhances the initiation of autophagy but displays a reduced ability to impede lysosome-dependent degradation. In summary, we demonstrated the dual-regulation mechanism of NSP6 in autophagy, which may be one of the reasons for targeting cellular autophagy to induce viral pathogenesis. This finding may provide promising new directions for future research and clinical interventions.">

        <tr id="Seasonal influenza continues to be a global health problem. Current existing vaccines and antivirals against influenza have limited effectiveness, and typically do not stay ahead of the viral evolutionary curve. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents that are effective therapeutically and prophylactically are much needed. We have created a promising new broad-spectrum anti-influenza agent using molecular engineering of a lectin from bananas, H84T, which is well-tolerated and protective in small animal models. However, the potency and effect of H84T on human immune cells and influenza-specific immune responses are undetermined. We found that H84T efficiently inhibited influenza A virus (IAV) replication in primary human dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from blood and tonsil, preserved DC viability and allowed acquisition and presentation of viral antigen. Excitingly, H84T-treated DCs subsequently initiated effective expansion of IAV-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, H84T preserved the capacity of IAV-exposed DCs to present a second non-IAV antigen and induce robust antigen-specific CD8 T cell expansion. Our data support H84T as a potent antiviral in humans as it not only effectively inhibits IAV infection, but also preserves induction of robust pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses against diverse antigens, which likely is clinically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection associated intestinal manifestations including diarrhea and proctitis have been frequently reported during mpox outbreaks. The clade IIb MPXV strain has caused the 2022-2023 global outbreak, whereas the Ia and Ib strains are causing the concurrent outbreaks in Africa. Here, we found clinical evidence that MPXV can directly infect human intestine to induce lesions. Intriguingly, primary organoids cultured from human ileum and rectum support productive infections of MPXV clade IIb, Ia and Ib strains. Upon differentiation, we found that enterocytes and goblet cells but not enteroendocrine cells are capable of supporting viral replication. Given that primary intestinal organoids can be rapidly expanded in large scale, we were able to screen a broad-spectrum antiviral drug library. We identified 12 leading candidates of safe-in-human agents including clinically used drugs such as clofarabine. We extensively validated the anti-MPXV activity of clofarabine in human intestinal and skin organoids, and consistently demonstrated the potent antiviral activity against clade Ia, Ib and IIb strains. These findings are important for better understanding the clinical manifestations of mpox. Primary intestinal organoids based infection models and the established antiviral drug discovery pipeline bear major implications in responding to the current mpox global health emergency, and sustaining epidemic poxvirus preparedness.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of mathematical modeling for understanding viral infection dynamics and accelerated its application into immunological research. Collaborative efforts among international research groups yielded a wealth of experimental data, which facilitated model development and validation. This study focuses on developing a modular mathematical model of the immune response, capturing the interactions between innate and adaptive immunity, with an application to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The model was validated using experimental data from middle-aged individuals with moderate COVID-19 progression, including measurements of viral load in the upper and lower airways, serum antibodies, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and interleukin-6 levels. Parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis were performed to improve the model accuracy. Additionally, identifiability analysis was conducted to assess whether the data were sufficient for reliable parameter estimation. The verified model simulates the dynamics of moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 progressions using measured data on lung epithelium damage, viral load, and IL-6 levels as key indicators of disease severity. We also performed a series of validation scenarios to assess whether the model correctly reproduces biologically relevant behaviors under various conditions, such as immunity hyperactivation, co-infection with HIV, and interferon administration as a therapeutic strategy. The model was developed as a component of the Digital Twin project and represents a general immune module that integrates both innate and adaptive immunity. It can be utilized for further COVID-19 research or serve as a foundation for studying other infectious diseases, provided sufficient data are available.">

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused a global public health crisis, with a significant impact on multiple body systems. This virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, shows ~80% genomic similarity to SARS-CoV and ~50% genomic similarity to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The spike (S) protein plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the virus, as it facilitates its entry into host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. In addition to the respiratory system damage, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a variety of gastrointestinal (GI), neurological, cardiovascular (CV), ocular, renal, etc. clinical manifestations. Neurological complications, such as anosmia, ague, headache, encephalitis and cerebrovascular events, were frequently observed, being attributed to both direct viral invasion and a very strong systemic inflammatory response. GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common and may occur independently of respiratory symptoms, and the presence of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) detected in fecal samples suggests possible fecal-oral transmission. The CV system is affected by myocardial damage, inflammation and coagulation disorders, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. At the ocular level, the virus was identified in ocular secretions, and conjunctivitis, uveitis and episcleritis were observed in about 11% of patients. Renal involvement, manifested by acute kidney injury, was detected in 0.5-7% of cases. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection is not limited to respiratory tract involvement but also has significant systemic implications.">

        <tr id="The outcome of the immune response depends on the content and magnitude of inflammatory mediators, the right time to start, and the duration of inflammatory responses. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent diverse disease severity. Understanding differences in immune responses in individuals with different disease severity levels can help elucidate disease mechanisms. Here, we serially analyzed the cytokine profiles of 809 patients with mild to critical COVID-19. The cytokine profile revealed an overall increase in IL-1β, IL-1Ra, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-18 and impaired production of IFN-α and -β. Only an early rise in IL-1Ra, IL-6, and IL-2 levels was linked to worse disease outcomes. On the other hand, long-term rises in IL-1β, IL-1Ra, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-18 levels were linked to worse disease outcomes. Principal component analysis identified a component, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-α, and IL-12, that was associated with disease severity. Spearman analysis revealed that the correlation of IL-1β and IFN-α was entirely different between mild and critical patients. Therefore, the ratio of IL-1β to IFN-α seemed to be a suitable criterion for distinguishing critical patients from mild ones. The higher levels of the IL-1β to IFN-α ratio correlated with improved outcomes. These data point to an imbalance of IL-1β/IFNα, contributing to hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to the emergence of viral variants with distinct characteristics. Understanding the differential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for effective public health response and treatment development. We investigated the differential effects of the original Wuhan strain and the emergent Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 using a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. We compared the mortality rates, viral loads, and histopathological changes in lung and tracheal tissues, as well as alterations in the lung and intestinal microbiota following infection. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between the variants, with the Wuhan strain causing higher mortality rates, severe lung pathology, and elevated viral loads compared to the Omicron variant. Microbiome analyses uncovered novel and distinct shifts in the lung and intestinal microbiota associated with each variant, providing evidence for variant-specific microbiome alterations. These changes suggest microbiome-related mechanisms that might modulate disease severity and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions This study highlights critical differences between the Wuhan strain and Omicron variant in terms of mortality, lung pathology, and microbiota changes, emphasizing the role of the microbiome in influencing disease outcomes. Novel findings include the identification of variant-specific microbiota shifts, which underscore potential microbiome-related mechanisms underlying differences in disease severity. These insights pave the way for future research exploring microbiome-targeted interventions to mitigate the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections.

Necroptosis, a form of cell death, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. However, the precise characteristics and mechanisms of necroptosis in ARDS remain unclear. Thus, our study seeks to elucidate the specific alterations and regulatory factors associated with necroptosis in ARDS and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the disease. We discovered that necroptosis mediates the progression of ALI through the activation and formation of the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL complex. Moreover, we substantiated the involvement of both MYD88 and TRIF in the activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway in ALI. Furthermore, we have developed a lipid micelle-encapsulated drug targeting MLKL in alveolar type II epithelial cells and successfully applied it to treat ALI in mice. This targeted nanoparticle selectively inhibited necroptosis, thereby mitigating epithelial cell damage and reducing inflammatory injury. Our study delves into the specific mechanisms of necroptosis in ALI and proposes novel targeted therapeutic agents, presenting innovative strategies for the management of ARDS.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) represent one of the most susceptible populations for developing severe COVID-19, and a unique human genetic condition for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility of neurologically vulnerable individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human Chromosome-21 (HSA21) triplication in DS causes global transcriptional deregulation, affecting multiple genes that may directly (e.g., TMPRSS2) or indirectly influence the SARS-CoV-2 entry into central nervous system (CNS) cells. The anti-viral immune response may also be altered in cells with trisomy-21 (T21) due to triplication of genes encoding for several interferon receptor subunits and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we demonstrate that human cells derived from fetal cortical specimens and maintained in primary cultures are susceptible to infection with a molecular clone of vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2) and to authentic SARS-CoV-2. The level of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cultures originated from different cortical specimens varied, seemingly depending on ploidy and chromosomal sex of the cells. We confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cultures and found that XY T21 group had the highest TMPRSS2 mRNA levels, which was associated with increased infectivity in XY—compared to XX T21 cultures. The XX T21 cultures exhibited elevated expression of several ISGs (MX1, STAT1, and STAT2) which was associated with lower infectivity. The comparisons of postmortem aged brain specimens revealed reduced ACE2, TMPRSS2, but elevated STAT2 protein levels in individuals with DS and Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD) compared to control and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. Collectively, these results suggest multifactorial regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cortical cells that involves ploidy, chromosomal sex, and the expression of genes implicated in regulation of virus entry and anti-viral response as contributing factors.

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose significant health threats. As tissue-resident macrophages, alveolar macrophages (AM) are crucial for defending against respiratory viral infection by producing cytokines, engulfing virus-infected cells, and promoting wound healing. However, excessive inflammatory responses can lead to tissue injury. Growing evidence indicates that astragaloside IV (AST IV) regulates innate immune responses. Specifically, AST IV balances the inflammatory response to mitigate tissue damage and promote tissue repair. However, whether AST IV directly targets AM to alleviate lung damage induced by respiratory viral infection remains unclear. Our results demonstrate that AST IV treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in mice during IAV infection. AST IV markedly decreases proinflammatory cytokine levels, mitigates lung injury and promotes lung recovery through enhancing the repair capacity mediated by alveolar type II cells. Mechanistically, AST IV suppresses the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, which is critical for driving inflammatory responses in AM while maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Thus, our findings suggest that AST IV effectively targets AM to alleviate inflammation and lung damage caused by respiratory viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing viral pneumonia.

        <tr id="Background Vitiligo is an acquired skin depigmentation disorder often accompanied by leukoderma and leukotrichia. Half of vitiligo patients experience episodes of stress. Methods We established a chronic unpredictable mild stimulation (CUMS) model in C57BL/6 J mice to simulate chronic mental stress-induced leukoderma and leukotrichia. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to determine the immune landscape and to characterize the relationship between immune-stromal cells. Immunohistochemistry was employed for validation. Results We discovered a similar pro-inflammatory micro-environment composed of keratinocytes and fibroblasts similar to that in human vitiligo. Macrophages in CUMS mice expressed high levels of inflammatory factors and were inclined to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype. Two distinct clusters of melanocytes were also identified: Mel2, defined as melanocyte stem cells, and Mel3, defined as mature melanocytes. Mel2 cells were prone to pyroptosis and necroptosis, while Mel3 cells were susceptible to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ferroptosis. Compared with control mice, higher expression of CXCL16 on dendritic cells and of the CXCL16 ligand, CXCR6, on γδT cells were observed in leukoderma. Dendritic cells and natural killer T cells in the CUMS mouse spleen exhibited elevated levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6, respectively. Activation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis and a non-specific immune response in our CUMS model might imitate chronic mental stress-induced vitiligo in humans better than CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated models. Conclusions We discovered two melanocyte clusters with distinct fates and a pro-inflammatory micro-environment with CXCL16–CXCR6 axis activation of antigen-presenting cells and other innate immunocytes that might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of stress-induced vitiligo.

        <tr id="SARS-CoV- 2 continues to evolve, producing novel Omicron subvariants through recombinant lineages that acquire new mutations, undermining existing antiviral strategies. The viral fitness and adaptive potential of SARS-CoV- 2 present significant challenges to emergency treatments, particularly monoclonal antibodies, which demonstrate reduced efficacy with the emergence of each new variant. Consequently, immunocompromised individuals, who are more susceptible to severe manifestations of COVID- 19 and face heightened risks of critical complications and mortality, remain vulnerable in the absence of effective emergency treatments. To develop translational approaches that can benefit this at-risk population and establish broader therapeutic strategies applicable across variants, we previously designed and engineered in silico miniACE2 decoys (designated BP2, BP9, and BP11). These decoys demonstrated promising efficacy in neutralizing Omicron subvariants. In this study, we leveraged the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for tissue repair and immunomodulation in lung injuries and used these cells as a platform for the secretion of BP2. Our innovative assays, which were conducted with the BP2 protein secreted into the culture supernatant of BP2-MSCs, demonstrated the potential for neutralizing SARS-CoV- 2, including Omicron subvariants. The development of these advanced therapeutic platforms holds significant promise for scalability to effectively mitigate the impact of severe COVID- 19, contributing to broader and more resilient treatment strategies against the evolving landscape of SARS-CoV- 2 variants.

        <tr id="Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.

This study aims to compare the immune phenotype of patients with LTBI/COVID-19 to those with COVID-19 alone, in order to assess whether latent tuberculosis infection induces significant immune cell alterations.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured and stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) to evaluate cellular distribution and function.the LTBI/COVID-19 group exhibited a narrower range of symptoms and required less complex treatment regimens than the COVID-19 group. The cellular evaluation revealed that individuals with COVID-19 displayed a distinct immune profile, characterized by a predominance of monocytes expressing pro-inflammatory and regulatory markers, including TNFR2, HLA-DR+TNFR2, and CD71. While CD4+ T cell subpopulation distribution and function were similar across groups, LTBI/COVID-19 and COVID-19 exhibited similar frequencies of CD8+perforin+ and CD8+Granzime B+ T cells. However, LTBI/COVID-19 displays lower soluble levels of granzyme B and perforin in culture supernatants and perforin, granulysin, and sFas in plasma compared to COVID-19. Notably, CD8+ T cells from LTBI/COVID-19 showed higher antigen-specific degranulation than COVID-19. Moreover, LTBI/COVID-19 individuals predominantly displayed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with highly polarized, compact mitochondria at baseline, which remained unchanged under stimulation. In contrast, COVID-19 had T cells with highly polarized, fragmented mitochondria at baseline, a profile that persisted under stimulation.The findings reveal significant alterations in monocytes and T cells of individuals with LTBI/COVID-19, suggesting that co-infection may induce changes in the cellular phenotype and cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Introduction Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to COVID19 disease and caused a worldwide pandemic in 2019. Since the first wave of infections, there has been significant antigenic shifts, leading to the emergence of new variants. Today, infections have shifted away from the severe, fatal infection seen in 2019. Objective This study aimed to assess how the plasma metabolomes from patients varied with infection with different strains and could reflect disease severity. Methods Patients with COVID19 not requiring intensive care were recruited between January 2021 and May 2022 from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; 33 patients with alpha, 13 delta and 14 omicron variants. These were compared to 26 age matched contemporaneously recruited controls. Plasma samples were extracted into chloroform/methanol/water (1:2.5/1 v/v) and assessed by flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Derived data were assessed using the R based MetaboAnalyst platform. Results Plasma metabolomes from COVID19 patients were clearly different from controls. Metabolite variation could be related to infection with different SARS-CoV2 variants. Variant showed different levels of some phospholipids, ganglioside GD1a and a dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative. Correlations of the plasma metabolomes indicated negative correlations between selected phospholipids and the levels of C-reactive protein, creatinine, neutrophil and D-dimer. Conclusion The plasma metabolomes of COVID19 patients show changes, particularly in phospholipids, which could reflect disease severity and SARS-CoV2 variant infection.

        <tr id="Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including altered innate lymphoid cell (ILC) immune responses, particularly during exacerbations (ECOPD). Baicalin, a natural compound prevalent in various herbal medicines, has shown promise as a therapeutic candidate in ECOPD. However, its potential and molecular mechanism for addressing ILC immune imbalance during ECOPD remain poorly understood. First, this study conducted a cross-sectional analysis of ILC immune responses in stable COPD patients and those experiencing exacerbations. Then, clinical findings of skewed ILC immunity were validated in cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide-induced ECOPD mouse models. Lastly, the therapeutic effect of baicalin on restoring ILC immune homeostasis was investigated in experimental ECOPD mouse models. Significant downregulation of ILC2 immunity was observed during COPD exacerbations, accompanied by increased ILC1 and ILC3 responses, particularly in cases associated with bacterial infections. Notably, elevated IL-22 levels were observed in this group. Administration of recombinant IL-22 in ECOPD mouse models disrupted lung ILC homeostasis, specifically inhibiting the accumulation of ILC2. Proteomics and transcriptomics analyses suggested IL-22 as a mediator of type 2 immune suppression by creating a molecular environment that favors type 1 and type 3 immunity. Treatment with baicalin effectively restored ILC2 immunity by enhancing the recruitment and activation of lung ILC2 while suppressing ILC1 and ILC3 responses. Importantly, baicalin attenuated IL-22 production from lung ILC3, highlighting its potential as an IL-22 inhibitor. Baicalin demonstrates potential as a therapeutic strategy for addressing ILC immune imbalance in COPD exacerbations, particularly by restoring ILC2 immunity and partially inhibiting IL-22 production.

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a complex, multifactorial condition characterized by persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks following acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, but chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and viral persistence are increasingly being implicated. This study investigated the immunopathological drivers of long COVID-19 and their associations with clinical manifestations and organ damage. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 200 COVID-19 survivors aged 18-65 years, in which immune markers, autoantibody profiles, lymphocyte dysfunction, and imaging findings were assessed over a 12-month period. Persistent inflammation was observed, with elevated interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α ± levels correlated with lung fibrosis and cognitive impairment. Autoantibodies were detected in 40% of the participants, particularly those with cardiovascular and neurological symptoms. A significant reduction in CD8+ T-cell counts was associated with severe fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, whereas persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 10% of cases, primarily in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms. Imaging studies revealed multiorgan involvement, with structural abnormalities in the lungs, heart, and brain. These findings highlight the interplay of immune dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and autoimmunity in long-term COVID-19, underscoring the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address its long-term health impacts.">

        <tr id="Asthma, a chronic airway disease, is marked by allergic inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and tissue remodeling. Influenza infections in asthma patients can cause severe exacerbations, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated how pre-existing allergic inflammation affects immune responses to influenza infection in mice exposed to house dust mite (HDM). Mice were repeatedly exposed to HDM, followed by infection with the influenza A virus, and were sacrificed three days post-infection. Plasma was analyzed for HDM-specific immunoglobulins, while lung tissue was used for immune cell flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analysis. HDM exposure induced allergic inflammation, evidenced by more HDM-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2, eosinophils, neutrophils, Th1, and Th17 cells compared to controls. Upon influenza infection, the effects of HDM and influenza co-infection interacted, showing fewer Th1 cells and regulatory T cells and more Th2 cells compared to mice exposed to the influenza virus alone. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed less upregulation of Th1-related genes and antiviral pathways in co-exposed mice, suggesting impaired Th1 immunity and antiviral responses. Pre-existing allergic inflammation significantly altered immune responses in mice co-infected with influenza, revealing underdeveloped antiviral responses as early as three days post-infection. These findings may explain the increased susceptibility of patients with asthma to severe viral diseases.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 variants present diverse clinical manifestations, necessitating deeper insights into their pathogenic effects. This study employs multi-omics approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on vascular damage. Plasma proteomic analysis of unvaccinated participants infected with Omicron BA.2.76 or ancestral variants identifies key signaling pathways associated with endothelial dysfunction, with the vinculin (VCL) pathway emerging as a hallmark of Omicron infections, contributing to lung exudation. Metabolomic analysis of plasma samples from the same cohort reveals disruptions in immune function, cell membrane integrity, and metabolic processes, including altered tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis pathways. An integrated analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data underscores the role of VCL in inflammation and extravasation, highlighting its interactions with adhesion molecules and inflammatory metabolites. A validation cohort of plasma samples from Omicron-infected participants confirms this association by replicating proteomic analysis, showing elevated VCL levels correlated with inflammatory markers. Functional studies in a male rat model of lung injury demonstrate that anti-VCL intervention reduces plasma VCL levels, mitigates alveolar edema, and restores alveolar-capillary barrier integrity, as assessed by histological staining and electron microscopy, thereby illustrating VCL modulation’s impact on vascular leakage and extravasation. These findings establish VCL as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating vascular complications in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

Small-scale molecular interactions have been analyzed by focusing on several genes/single genes, providing important insights; however, genome-wide multi-omics comprehensive molecular interactions have not yet been well investigated with the exception of GWAS and eQTLm, both of which show genetic risks. From April of 2020 until now, we have created a Japan-wide system, initially named the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. This system has collected more than 6500 COVID-19 patients’ peripheral blood and as much associated clinical information as possible from a network of more than 120 hospitals. DNA, RNA, serum, and plasma were extracted and stored in this bank. This study unravels the interplay of inflammatory gene networks that induce different COVID-19 severity levels (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) by using multi-omics data from the Japan COVID-19 Task Force. We analyze RNA and protein expressions to estimate severity-specific inflammation networks that uncover the interplay between RNA and protein networks via ligand–receptor pairs. Our large-scale RNA/protein expression data analysis reveals that the atypical chemokine receptor 2 (ACKR2) acts as a key broker linking RNA and protein inflammation networks to induce COVID-19 critical severity. ACKR2 emerges in RNA and protein inflammation networks, showing active interplay in high-severity cases and weak interactions in mild cases. The results also show severity-specific molecular interactions between interleukin (IL), cytokine receptor activity, cell adhesion, and interactions involving the CC chemokine ligand (CCL) gene family and ACKR2.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated a global pandemic resulting in an estimated 775 million infections with over 7 million deaths, it has become evident that COVID-19 is not solely a pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has shown that, in a subset of patients, certain symptoms − including chest pain, stroke, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and abdominal pain – all indicate a role of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in the disease process. Many of these disease processes persist long after the acute disease has been resolved, resulting in ‘long COVID’ or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and systemic conditions associated with COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Appropriate animal models provide a method of understanding underlying disease mechanisms at the system level through the study of disease progression, tissue pathology, immune system response to the pathogen and behavioral responses. However, very few studies have addressed PASC and whether existing models hold promise for studying this challenging problem. Here, we review the current literature on cardiovascular, neurological and GI pathobiology caused by COVID-19 in patients, along with established animal models of the acute disease manifestations and their prospects for use in PASC studies. Our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of appropriate models in order to recapitulate certain aspects of the disease to enhance the translatability of mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Objective. The aim was to evaluate specific T-cell and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in children hospitalized with respiratory infectious diseases.Materials and methods. Examination of 121 children was carried out in 2021–2024. Among them 22% of patients were under 1 year of age, 33% — 1–3 years, 21% 4–6 years, 24% 7–14 years. In 51 children acute respiratory infection was concomitant with the course of pertussis. Diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infections was based on clinical data and on PCR testing of nasopharyngeal mucus including PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Using a method we developed, memory T cells specific to the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein were assessed in patients' blood. IgG- and IgM-antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein in blood serum were also tested.Results. IgG antibodies to S-glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the blood of 55% of children in 2021, 65% in 2022, 82% in 2023, and 96% in 2024. T lymphocytes activated by stimulation with recombinant S-glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the blood of 25% of children in 2021, 70% in 2022 and 19–35% in 2023–2024. A significant (55%) frequency of serologic markers of transmitted undiagnosed COVID-19 was found in children under 3 years of age whose contacts, especially in 2021, were limited to family. In the groups of patients 3–14 years old, even more children were seropositive (95–100%). Memory T cells were found less frequently in children younger 3 years than after 3 years of age.Conclusion. Examination of individuals with various respiratory diseases can clarify ideas about what part of the population has acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2, as well as assess the role of memory T cells and antibodies to “ancestral” and current strains of SARS-CoV-2 in limiting morbidity.">

        <tr id="The blood‒brain barrier (BBB) is a critical selective interface between the central nervous system (CNS) and the blood circulation. BBB dysfunction plays an important role in the neurological damage caused by sepsis. However, the mechanisms underlying the disruption of the BBB during sepsis remain unclear. We established a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB model and reported that treating with sepsis patient serum leads to structural and functional disruption of the BBB. In a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced mouse model of sepsis, we also observed disruption of the BBB, inflammation in the brain, and impairments in cognition. In both models, we found that the expression of TREM-1 was significantly increased in endothelial cells. TREM-1 knockout specifically in endothelial cells alleviated BBB dysfunction and cognitive impairments. Further study revealed that TREM-1 affects the expression of genes involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The protective effects of TREM-1 inhibition on the BBB and cognition were abrogated by PI3K inhibitors. Our findings suggest that endothelial TREM-1 induces sepsis-induced BBB disruption and cognitive impairments via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Targeting endothelial TREM-1 or the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be a promising strategy to maintain BBB integrity and improve cognitive function in sepsis patients.

        <tr id="Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to persistent or newly emerging symptoms lasting for months, a condition known as long COVID (LC). The pathophysiology of LC remains poorly understood, with cytokine dysregulation proposed as a key mechanism, although findings across the studies have been inconsistent. Patients and methods: We conducted a longitudinal study using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation Panel to assess cytokines in COVID-19 (COV) patients at three months and six months post-infection. These profiles were compared with those of individuals recovering from other upper respiratory tract infections (non-COV). Additionally, we analyzed differences between individuals with LC and those who recovered from COVID-19. Predictive models for LC at three months and sixth months post-infection were developed using inflammatory markers and relevant clinical cofactors, including gender, age, BMI, hemogram, Β2-microglobulin, D-dimers, LDH, AST, ALT, Ferritin, vitamin D, CRP, and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection as classified by WHO criteria. Results: We observed a general decline in inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients over time, with only a few cytokines elevated (CCL4 at month 3 and CST5 at month 6) compared to non-COV controls. In LC patients, an early phase of low-grade inflammation transitioned into significant reduction in proinflammatory biomarkers compared to recovered individuals. Rather than indicating immune normalization, this pattern suggests a possible suppression or exhaustion of the immune response in the months following acute infection. Importantly, our predictive modeling demonstrated that this specific cytokine signature, in combination with acute disease severity and clinical cofactors, described well the presence of LC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that inflammation-related biomarker dysregulation following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection evolves dynamically over a six-month period. By the sixth month, compared to the third month, the presence of LC is more accurately predicted by a combination of persistent biomarker alteration and the severity of the initial infection, as defined by WHO criteria. This represents a novel insight, as previous studies have primarily associated LC with elevated proinflammatory markers, whereas our results suggest that immune suppression or exhaustion may play a more prominent role in the later stages.">

        <tr id="Despite the early recognition that individuals living with obesity are more prone to develop adverse outcomes during COVID-19, the mechanisms underlying these conditions are still unclear. During obesity, an accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the circulation promotes low-grade inflammation. Here, we show that FFAs induce epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, exacerbating their inflammatory profile after SARS-CoV-2 infection, a mechanism named metabolic-primed immunity. Monocytes from people with obesity or primed with palmitate, a central component of circulating FFAs, presented elevated viral load and higher gene expression of IL-6. Palmitate-primed monocytes upregulate fatty acid oxidation and FFAs entry into the mitochondria. FFA-derived acetyl-CoA is then converted into citrate, exiting the mitochondria and is used to support H3K18 histone acetylation, which regulates IL-6 accessibility. Ingestion of palm oil by lean and healthy individuals increased circulating FFAs levels and was sufficient to exacerbate the inflammatory profile of monocytes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings demonstrate that obesity-derived FFAs induce the metabolic priming of monocytes, which exacerbates the inflammatory response observed in people with severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Although the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the emergence of the post-COVID-19 condition presents a new and complex public health challenge, characterized by persistent, multisystem symptoms that can endure for weeks or months after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, significantly affecting survivors’ quality of life. Among the most concerning sequelae are cardiovascular complications, which encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial damage, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This narrative review explores the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health by reviewing the latest and most relevant findings in the literature and highlighting different aspects of COVID-19’s cardiovascular involvement. This review investigates the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular involvement in the post-COVID-19 condition, with a focus on direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, immune-mediated cardiovascular injury, cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial injury. The interplay between pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19 is also explored, revealing that individuals with such conditions are at heightened risk for both severe acute illness and long-term complications. Long-term immune activation and the persistence of viral antigens are increasingly recognized as contributors to ongoing cardiovascular damage, even in individuals with mild or asymptomatic initial infections. As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a deeper understanding of these cardiovascular manifestations is essential. This knowledge will inform the development of targeted strategies for prevention, clinical management, and rehabilitation of affected patients. Furthermore, the insights gained from the intersection of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping responses to future viral epidemics, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches to patient care and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Background Defining the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is critical for informing the management of reinfections, vaccinations, and therapeutics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Using four antibody assays, we evaluated antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and receptor binding domain (RBD) in 98 convalescent participants with varying COVID-19 disease severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe) at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months post-SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR and in 17 non-vaccinated, non-infected controls. Results Increasing acute COVID-19 disease severity correlates with higher anti-N and anti-RBD titers throughout 12 months post-infection. Anti-N and anti-RBD titers decline over time in all participants, except for increased anti-RBD titers post-vaccination, with hospitalized participants exhibiting faster decay rates. Less than 50% of participants retain anti-N titers above controls at 12 months, with non-hospitalized participants falling below controls sooner. Nearly all participants maintain anti-RBD titers above controls for 12 months, suggesting long-term protection against severe reinfections. Nonetheless, by 6 months, few participants retain >50% of their initial 1-month anti-N or anti-RBD titers. Notably, vaccine-induced anti-RBD titers are higher in non-hospitalized participants. Lastly, early convalescent titers correlate with age but not with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) status or steroid use. Conclusion Hospitalized participants initially develop higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that decline faster relative to non-hospitalized participants. While anti-N titers fall below control levels in some participants, anti-RBD titers remain above controls over 12 months, demonstrating long-lived antibody responses known to protect against severe disease. These findings advance our understanding of COVID-19 antibody dynamics.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has a diverse spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe and critical cases that result in the death of the patient. Alongside the viral factors host factors like Age, deregulation of the immune response and presence of comorbidity determine the patient’s outcome. Here we sought to assess the impact of age on natural antibody response, CBC-based inflammatory markers, and outcome of COVID-19 patients. We divided the participants into three groups, young (≤ 35 years), middle-aged (40–60 years), and old (≥ 65 years) patients and collected and analyzed sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. We found that elderly patients showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of inflammation like increased neutrophil percentages, NLR, lymphopenia, and low Hgb levels, compared to middle-aged and young patients. Interestingly these markers were also associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in ion concentration, lipid profile, and coagulation test between the three age groups. We also found that elderly patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased levels of natural antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the two groups. Lastly, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone treatment, even if statistically not significant (P > 0.05) we observed a positive trend among patients under dexamethasone in the aspect of decreasing inflammatory markers. To conclude we showed that SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by an age-dependent deregulation of inflammatory markers that are associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Life-threatening severe dengue (SD) develops in a small subset of patients suffering from dengue fever (DF), a febrile disease that develops following infection with dengue virus (DENV). DENV is a mosquito-borne positive -sense RNA virus. The rapid spread of DENV vectors, which was exacerbated by climate change and inadequate control measures, has led to outbreaks affecting millions worldwide. There is no specific treatment for DF, and the recently introduced vaccines are ineffective in containing the current outbreaks. Like many other viral diseases, the immune system plays a key role in dengue pathogenesis. The lack of models replicating the disease’s immunopathological features has hampered the understanding of the immune system’s role in developing this disease. Recent advances, such as single-cell approaches, provide better systems and methodologies to study the role of different immune cells in SD, closing this gap and providing a better mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis and promoting the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions. Here, we summarize recent advances in SD research, focusing on immune cell interactions and their role in disease severity.">

        <tr id="Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV), a member of the family Arenaviridae, is a highly pathogenic virus capable of causing severe systemic infections in humans. The primary host reservoir is the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), with human infections typically occurring through mucosal exposure to virus-containing aerosols from rodent excretions. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying LASV replication in the respiratory tract, we utilized differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) grown under air–liquid interface conditions, closely mimicking the bronchial epithelium in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that HAECs are permissive to LASV infection and support productive virus replication. While LASV entry into polarized HAECs occurred through both apical and basolateral surfaces, progeny virus particles were predominantly released from the apical surface, consistent with an intrinsic apical localization of the envelope glycoprotein GP. This suggests that apical virus shedding from infected bronchial epithelia may facilitate LASV transmission via airway secretions. Notably, limited basolateral release at later stages of infection was associated with LASV-induced rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in compromised epithelial barrier integrity. Finally, we demonstrate that LASV-infected HAECs exhibited a pronounced type III interferon response. A detailed understanding of LASV replication and host epithelial responses in the respiratory tract could facilitate the development of targeted future therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) pathology involves complex immune responses within granulomatous lesions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cellular compositions of necrotizing granulomatous lesions that developed in the lungs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We identified 11 distinct major cell types, including phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, and T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among T cells, particularly, Pdcd1⁺ γδ T cells were detected in necrotizing granulomatous lesions, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Within the macrophage populations, we identified a cluster with significantly higher Plin2 expression compared to other clusters, whose transcriptomic profile was consistent with that of foamy macrophages. A subset of the Plin2-expressing macrophages was identified as a major source of Ifnb1 and Cxcl1, suggesting their involvement in type I interferon signaling and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, we identified Flrt2, Hyal1, and Mmp13 as novel molecular markers of Plin2-expressing macrophages, which were localized to the peripheral rim regions of necrotizing granulomas. In conclusion, our results provide the immune landscape of necrotizing granulomas and reveal novel functional states of macrophages contributing to TB pathogenesis.">

Clustering analysis using the K-prototypes method identified underlying biological patterns in patients with COVID-19. The penalized multinomial logistic regression analysis identified two comorbidities (hypertension, congestive heart failure) and thirteen analytes as potential risk factors for COVID-19 progression with 88.2% accuracy. Based on a patient’s age, high concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and pentraxin 3 were important biomarkers for lethal COVID-19. Decreased concentrations of interferon gamma-induced protein-10, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I were found to be associated with mild COVID-19, while increasing concentrations of these analytes could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.">

 Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ended, the enduring health impacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continue to garner global attention, as approximately 10% of patients develop long COVID (post COVID-19 condition). The epidemiological characteristics and symptoms of long COVID have been reported, and various pathogenic hypotheses have been proposed. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or fragments persist in some patients post-infection and that these are correlated with long COVID symptoms. This review focuses on clinical studies linking SARS-CoV-2 persistence to long COVID symptoms, and explores the relationship between viral persistence and other etiological hypotheses, such as immune dysregulation, vascular issues, coagulation dysfunction, microbiome dysbiosis, brainstem/vagus nerve signaling dysfunction, and latent virus reactivation. Futhermore, treatment strategies for long COVID are proposed based on current clinical trials of antiviral and immune modulation therapies. Understanding the role of viral persistence in long COVID pathogenesis is critical for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical management of this debilitating condition.

        <tr id="Chronic liver injury triggers the activation and recruitment of immune cells, causing antigen-independent tissue damage and liver disease progression. Tissue inflammation can reshape macrophage composition through monocyte replacement. Replacement of tissue macrophages with monocytes differentiating in an inflammatory environment can potentially imprint a phenotype that switches the liver from an immune-tolerant organ to one predisposed to tissue damage. We longitudinally sampled the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had active liver inflammation and were starting antiviral therapy. Antiviral therapy suppressed viral replication and liver inflammation, which coincided with decreased myeloid activation markers. Single-cell RNA-Seq mapped peripheral inflammatory markers to a monocyte-derived macrophage population, distinct from Kupffer cells, with an inflammatory transcriptional profile. The inflammatory macrophages (iMacs) differentiated from blood monocytes and were unique from macrophage found in healthy or cirrhotic liver. iMacs retained their core transcriptional signature after inflammation resolved, indicating inflammation-mediated remodeling of the macrophage population in the human liver that may affect progressive liver disease and immunotherapy.">

While positive results from modern systemic immune-therapy trials in relapsing disease provide support for the long proposed concept that recruitment of immune constituents to the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to the disease pathogenesis, risk of post-treatment recurrence and limited effectiveness in progressive disease indicate the need to define further processes that contribute to each phase of the disease course. Amongst remaining challenges and opportunities to extend beyond non-specific immune therapy for advancing MS care include : identification of the disease initiating event and what determines individual susceptibility; promoting protection and repair/replacement capacity of the putative targets of disease (oligodendrocytes and their myelin processes, axons) and modulation of the properties of constituents that comprise the CNS microenvironment ( ie glial cells) and its surrounding niches to favor a homeostatic versus pathogenic state.

        <tr id="CD16 is an activating Fc receptor on natural killer cells that mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a key mechanism in antiviral immunity. However, the role of NK cell-mediated ADCC in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly whether it limits viral spread and disease severity or contributes to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. We hypothesized that the high-affinity CD16AV176 polymorphism influences these outcomes. Using a novel in vitro reporter system, we demonstrated that CD16AV176 is a more potent and sensitive activator than the common CD16AF176 allele. To assess its clinical relevance, we analyzed 1,027 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC), a comprehensive longitudinal dataset with extensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical data. The high-affinity CD16AV176 allele was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and severe disease trajectories. Lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were correlated to CD16AV176; however, there was no difference in viral load across CD16 genotypes. Proteomic analysis revealed that participants homozygous for CD16AV176 had lower levels of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that CD16AV176 enhances early NK cell-mediated immune responses, limiting severe respiratory complications in COVID-19. This study identifies a protective genetic factor against severe COVID-19, informing future host-directed therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had a profound impact on the onset, progression, and management of diabetes, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. This review elucidates the multifaceted impact of SARS-CoV-2 on diabetes mellitus, emphasizing the increased complexity of glycemic management in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection following viral infection in the postpandemic era. In this study, we examined the diverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on individuals with diabetes. These effects included an elevated risk of morbidity, erratic fluctuations in blood glucose levels, the emergence of complications associated with diabetes, and the emergence of challenges related to self-management of the disease. From a mechanistic perspective, we investigated the following factors: SARS-CoV-2-mediated direct damage to islet beta cells, dysregulation of the RAAS system, impairment of islet function by oxidative stress, and the effects of the integrated stress response, stress response, and reduced adiponectin levels on insulin utilization efficiency and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, viral effects extend to diabetic complications and cardiovascular risk factors, such as coagulation abnormalities, hypertension, and lipid metabolism. This results in an exacerbation of the development of diabetic complications. This review highlights the urgent need for refined management strategies for patients with diabetes during the pandemic and in the later stages of COVID-19. Additionally, there is a need for integrated management strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the long-term outcomes of patients with diabetes.">

        <tr id="West Nile virus (WNV), a globally distributed flavivirus, poses a significant public health threat, causing West Nile fever and potentially severe neuroinvasive disease in humans. The absence of specific antiviral treatments and licenced human vaccines underscores the importance of understanding WNV pathogenesis, particularly the mechanisms by which it evades host immune responses. This review comprehensively analyzes the multifaceted immune evasion strategies employed by WNV, encompassing the suppression of interferon (IFN) production and signalling through targeting of STAT proteins, IRF3, and RNA sensors, the modulation of antigen presentation via downregulation of MHC molecules and impairment of proteasome function, and the manipulation of cytokine and chemokine responses to dysregulate inflammation and promote viral persistence. Furthermore, WNV exploits the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to gain access to the central nervous system (CNS), both by disrupting the barrier integrity and utilising “Trojan horse” mechanisms. The potential for antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) further complicates the host‐virus interaction. Understanding these immune evasion mechanisms is crucial for deciphering WNV pathogenesis and informing the development of effective vaccines and targeted immunotherapies aimed at preventing and treating WNV‐related diseases. Future research should focus on translating this knowledge into tangible clinical benefits for at‐risk populations, particularly regarding strategies to induce broadly neutralising antibody responses and robust T‐cell immunity while mitigating the risk of ADE.">

        <tr id="Introduction The H9N2 avian influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans. Methods This study investigated the effects of baicalin, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection. In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells, and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection. Results Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, helping to counteract the virus’s suppression of these defense proteins. In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier, baicalin has both antiviral and immune-regulating effects: it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2-infected mice. Most importantly, baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced. These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways (Mx1 and PKR) and restoring adaptive immune balance (CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio). Discussion These dual protective effects highlight baicalin’s potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine-resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2, contributing valuable insights into plant-derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats.">

        <tr id="Background Neuropathological and clinical studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the long-term risk of neurodegeneration. Methods We provide a narrative overview of pathological and clinical observations justifying the implementation of a surveillance program to monitor changes in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the years after COVID-19. Results Autopsy studies revealed diverse changes in the brain, including loss of vascular integrity, microthromboses, gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal- and glial injury and cell death, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals irrespective of the severity of COVID-19. Recent data suggest that microglia play an important role in sustained COVID-19-related inflammation, which contributes to the etiology initiating a neurodegenerative cascade, to the worsening of pre-existing neurodegenerative disease or to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Histopathological data have been supported by neuroimaging, and epidemiological studies also suggested a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases after COVID-19. Conclusions Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic, healthcare systems should be aware of, and be prepared for a potential increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the upcoming years. Strategies may include follow-up of well-described cohorts, analyses of outcomes in COVID-19-registries, nationwide surveillance programs using record-linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses, and comparing the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the post-pandemic periods to values of the pre-pandemic years. Awareness and active surveillance are particularly needed, because diverse clinical manifestations due to earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may no longer be quoted as post-COVID-19 symptoms, and hence, increasing incidence of neurodegenerative pathologies at the community level may remain unnoticed.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Long-term immunosuppressive therapy typically increases the risk of viral infection, yet during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients showed reduced severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility. This suggests potential overlapping molecular mechanisms between IBD and COVID-19 that warrant investigation.


METHODS
From April 2020 to April 2022, we enrolled 363 IBD patients and 146 healthy donors. Serum samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorption assay to determine the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and to measure concentrations of the host-soluble factors sACE2 and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which have SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity. Furthermore, colonic mucosa biopsies were analyzed by real-time PCR to confirm the upregulation of MBL2 as well as to assess the expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules (ie, ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, ADAM17, AGTR1).


RESULTS
Intestinal mucosa expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4 genes was significantly lower in IBD than in healthy individuals, regardless of the type of medication, while ADAM17 and AGT1R were similar across groups. Serum sACE2 levels changed minimally, whereas circulating MBL levels were significantly higher in CD and somewhat elevated in UC patients versus controls. Parallel trends in MBL2 gene expression were observed in IBD patients' intestinal mucosa.


CONCLUSIONS
Overall, our study indicates that the presence of higher basal circulating levels of MBL in CD patients and the decreased intestinal mucosa expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the host cell priming proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in both CD and UC patients may reduce COVID-19 risk, underscoring the potential protective role of these biomarkers in IBD populations against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus’ ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.">

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which
causes COVID-19, causes damage to many organ systems because of the presence of receptor Angiotensin-
Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) in widespread tissues. Its pathogenesis includes viral reproduction,
immunopathy, oxidative damage, and pathological cytokine activities, which all contribute
to its high morbidity and mortality rates. While there are no specific antiviral drugs, preclinical
studies have found ginger to be effective in alleviating inflammation, oxidative stress, and viral
infections. Research indicates that ginger could help improve the inflammatory and oxidative stress
induced by SARS-CoV-2, thus supporting the treatment of COVID-19. The present review reveals
the clinical significance of ginger towards COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy and discusses the therapeutic
potential of ginger during the COVID-19 pandemic by merging traditional medicine, molecular
and in-vitro studies, and clinical studies.

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 presents with a distinct immunological profile, characterized by elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts, seen commonly in fungal and bacterial infections. This study demonstrates that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 show evidence of neutrophil degranulation and have increased expression of neutrophil surface lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), a marker of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). Both early LOX-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on neutrophils were associated with development of severe disease. To determine whether tissue damage or inflammation is required to induce PMN-MDSCs or whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly activates neutrophils to become PMN-MDSCs, we incubated healthy human neutrophils with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly induced LOX-1 surface expression in healthy neutrophils independent of productive infection. LOX-1 induction was dependent on granule exocytosis and promoted up-regulation of reactive oxygen species, CD63, and PD-L1, enabling LOX-1+ neutrophils to suppress autologous T cell proliferation in vitro. These results support a role for PMN-MDSCs in mediating severe COVID-19, and inhibition of PD-L1 represents a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management.


METHODS
Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines.


RESULTS
The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="The SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has impacted the health of millions globally, with many individuals experiencing persistent symptoms even after testing negative, a condition known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or long COVID. This study analyzes demographic influences on the severity and duration of PASC symptoms, with an emphasis on physiological and cognitive effects. Using a self-reporting survey method, data were collected from a sample of 110 participants and analyzed using statistical methods such as exploratory factor analysis, Pearson correlation, and two-factor analysis of variance. The participants were primarily based in California, and a majority of them were ethnically Asian. The study found that females generally reported higher severity of cognitive and physiological symptoms compared to males, while symptom severity was generally lower among vaccinated individuals. Correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between depression and cognitive impairments, underscoring the psychological impact of PASC. This study emphasizes the complexity of PASC, demonstrating how demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and vaccination status influence the severity and duration of symptoms, thereby contributing to the growing understanding of PASC. Further research should consider SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific impacts and broader population samples.">

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic demanded diverse vaccination strategies, and there is significant interest in their effectiveness in generating a robust immune response. In Brazil, the use of CoronaVac was crucial in reducing mortality; however, heterologous booster doses were necessary to enhance memory immune response. This study aimed to evaluate the humoral and cellular immunity in healthcare workers who were vaccinated with a complete regimen of CoronaVac and subsequently received heterologous booster doses over nearly one year. Methods A longitudinal study recruited healthcare professionals with varying levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from the Health Complex of the Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Blood samples were collected at five time points, including baseline and after vaccination with CoronaVac and heterologous booster doses (ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BNT162b2). The Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production was measured by Flow Cytometry, using whole blood samples stimulated or not with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In parallel, serum levels of IgG antibodies against Spike (anti-S) and Nucleocapsid (anti-N) proteins were assessed using an immunoassay. Adjustments were made for confounding factors, including age, sex, level of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and COVID-19 infection status. Results Our results demonstrate that CoronaVac induced high anti-S IgG levels at all evaluated time points (P<0.01). Cytokine analysis revealed a sustained production of antigen-specific Th1 cytokines, including IL-2 (P<0.01) and IFN-γ (P<0.05) regardless of level of SARS-CoV-2 exposure or previous COVID-19 infection at any point during the study. Additionally, we identified six moderate to strong positive correlations (P<0.0001): IL-10 and IFN-γ (ρ=0.77), IL-6 and TNF (ρ=0.77), IL-2 and IFN-γ (ρ=0.71), IL-6 and IL-10 (ρ=0.66), anti-N IgG and anti-S IgG (ρ=0.62), and IL-2 and anti-S IgG (ρ=0.62). Conclusion The CoronaVac elicited an antigen-specific cellular immune response, characterized by enhancing the production of key cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2, with high levels of anti-S IgG. Furthermore, the administration of heterologous boosters significantly enhanced these immune responses, demonstrating induced-specific immunological response. These findings underscore the importance of primary vaccination and boosters in inducing immune protection against COVID-19, potentially informing future vaccination policies and approaches.">

        <tr id="The incidence rate of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is rising. However, the pathogenesis of CAPA remains unclear. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disrupts pathways related to type I interferon and Toll-like receptors, key components in innate immunity, thereby elevating the incidence of CAPA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in T and B cell functional deficiencies or exhaustion within adaptive immunity, weakening the defense against invasive Aspergillus. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and alters the gut microbiota, factors that may aid in diagnosing CAPA. Immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 patients is also believed to heighten the risk of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, this review, examines the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with invasive aspergillosis, and explores the pathogenesis and susceptibility factors of CAPA. We propose that variations in an individual’s immune response significantly determine susceptibility to CAPA. The aim of this paper is to deepen clinical understanding of CAPA’s pathogenesis, thereby aiding in mitigating susceptibility risk and advancing novel treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Common cold coronaviruses were a frequent cause of respiratory infections in older adults living in congregate care homes before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which may influence immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination and infection. We investigated humoral and cellular immune responses to prior common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, how they are affected by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection, and their associations with Omicron BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of long-term care and retirement homes. Methods In SARS-CoV-2 infection–naive residents with 3 monovalent messenger RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, we measured serum anti–receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and common cold human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E; ancestral and Omicron BA.1 neutralizing antibodies; and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation responses to membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike proteins. We examined the relationships of common cold coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune responses, whether antibody and T-cell responses changed after SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccination or infection, and their associations with Omicron BA.1 infection. Results Anti-RBD IgG HCoV-OC43 titers were positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibody titers. Common cold coronavirus anti-RBD IgA titers, but not anti-RBD IgG titers, increased after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, and many residents had cross-reactive T cells. Common cold coronavirus humoral immunity was similar in residents without and those with subsequent Omicron BA.1 infection. Conclusions Despite frequent exposure, and associations of common cold coronavirus and vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity, preexisting common cold coronavirus immunity was not associated with Omicron BA.1 infection in residents of long-term care and retirement communities.">

        <tr id="Background & objectives COVID-19 is a complex disease that affects multiple systems and causes inflammation due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s attraction to ACE-2 receptors. The severity of the disease ranges from mild upper respiratory tract infections to multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Critical clinical features, such as respiratory failure, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, and a hypercoagulable state, are common in severe COVID-19 illness. Identifying patients at higher risk of rapid disease progression leading to severe complications and death is crucial. Available biomarkers lack specificity and accuracy in identifying the severity of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there is a need to identify specific endothelial biomarkers that can predict early organ damage, facilitate effective management of patients, and categorise multisystem involvement during COVID-19 infection. Methods The participants constituted laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-positive patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) features under home isolation or moderate to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) manifestations requiring admission. The chosen markers were analysed using the Human Luminex multiplex bead-based assay system. Results Our study revealed that certain markers, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and Galectin-3 were elevated in all COVID-19-positive patients, while others, like vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), Angiopoietin-2, Thrombomodulin, and tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) were specifically elevated in patients requiring admission. Such findings indicated the potential of some biomarkers in disease prognostication. Interpretation & conclusions Effective management of COVID-19 requires proper risk stratification. The findings of our investigation underscore the necessity for additional research to confirm the clinical utility and importance of these biomarkers and to fully leverage their capabilities in informing the management of severe COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 virus induced COVID-19 pandemic has left survivors to frequently experience cognitive and neuropsychiatric problems such as “brain fog” which is one of many post-acute neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (Neuro-PASC), also referred to as long-COVID. It is unclear whether Neuro-PASC or the cognitive changes of long-term COVID are linked to increased risk for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Although mechanisms involved in the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system remains a challenge, studies have reported the presence of viral particles and viral RNA inside the brain. Our previous data suggest perivascular and vascular inclusions of Transactive response DNA/RNA binding protein-43 occur within astrocytes and endothelial cells in Alzheimer’s and COVID-19 human brain. In the present study, we tested whether SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and vascular phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) inclusions are associated with destabilized or disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB disruption is a feature of several age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, here we asked whether there are any mechanistic links between vascular and perivascular pTDP-43 inclusions and BBB tight junction disruption, which potentially parallel changes to BBB in AD? To test this, hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) from human AD brains (Braak IV-VI; CERAD definite) and cognitively normal age- and sex-matched controls, with and without comorbid COVID-19, were selected from autopsy cases conducted at Yale between 2014-2018 (non-COVID), and COVID-positive cases conducted between April 2020-2023; (n=10-12 per group). Immunofluorescence staining and Confocal imaging revealed differential and distinctive patterns of the three main tight junction proteins of BBB, Claudin-5, Occludin and Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1). Quantitative analysis revealed a highly significantly downregulated expression of Claudin-5 correlating with upregulated expression of GFAP and pTDP-43. The destabilization of the tight junction proteins on aberrant pTDP-43 inclusions suggests a potential breach in the blood-brain barrier and the activation of the paracellular route. The BBB breach is further confirmed by the presence of IgG molecules in the brain parenchyma and enhanced presence of IgG inside the microvessels of AD and COVID. Furthermore, a crucial finding is the increased transendothelial migration with the labeling of CD31 or Platelet endothelial cell adhesion protein PECAM-1 with pTDP-43 and the increased expression of endothelium specific fenestration marker protein, PLVAP compared to the Control. This implies protein leakage, barrier breakdown and loss of barrier integrity and increase in leukocyte trafficking, possibly intensifying inflammatory cascades. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of intensified phosphoTDP-43 microvasculopathy and compromised blood-brain barrier; via transcellular and paracellular pathways in SARS-CoV-2 and AD brain. Moreover this data provide evidence for SARS-CoV-2 fostering similar neuropathophysiological features found in Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a potential link between Long-COVID and development of AD.

        <tr id="Background: The coronavirus–caused disease (COVID-19), first identified in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide becoming a global pandemic. Although people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus presented mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in cardiovascular incidents was observed in several scientific studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response leading to a dysregulation of immune system function and massive production of inflammatory cytokines commonly known as “cytokine storm”. Methods: 57 patients eventually participated in the study, assigned to non–COVID (24 patients) and COVID (33 patients) groups. After signing consent to participate in the study, each patient was given a self–administered questionnaire to fill out prior to specimen collection, anthropometric measurements were taken and venous blood was collected for the following determinations: pro- and anti–inflammatory cytokines using a Bio–Plex 200 system, oxidative stress markers and basic hematological blood parameters. Results: showed statistically significant higher values of IL–1Ra and IL–1β in the COVID-19 group. Of the oxidative stress markers, only MDA levels were higher in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: the results of our study provide evidence and support the occurrence of elevated levels of IL–1Ra, IL–1β and MDA in the COVID-19 group of patients, which are associated with a worse course and prognosis of COVID-19. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and dysregulation of the immune system associated with the cytokine storm is essential to select patients at risk and develop effective drugs and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Aimed to comprehensively investigate the presence of neural autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of COVID‐19 patients experiencing neurological complications during the Omicron wave in China. Forty consecutive COVID‐19 patients with severe neurological complications and 15 disease controls (DC) were enrolled. Neural autoantibodies were detected using both the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on mouse brain tissue and the Brain‐neuronal‐antigen microarray. Our results indicated a significantly higher prevalence of neural autoantibodies in the CSF (62.16% vs. 0.0%) and plasma (38.71% vs. 13.33%) of COVID‐19 patients compared to DC. Additionally, we identified 12 upregulated intrathecal IgG autoantibodies with differential levels between COVID‐19 patients and DC, as well as 51 upregulated IgG autoantibodies in plasma. A high prevalence of anti‐mGluR2 antibodies (13.33%) in COVID‐19 patients was confirmed by cell‐based assays. Western blot analysis showed these antibodies cross‐react with both the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2. Notably, strong binding to both the S protein's RBD‐Fc and mGluR2 was observed, an association that was substantiated by bioinformatics analysis evaluating the similarity between SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins and the targeted antigens on the microarray. This finding hints at a potential cross‐reactivity between anti‐mGluR2 antibodies and the S protein in COVID‐19 patients.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2's continued global health impact underscores the importance of ongoing pathogenesis research. Insights into the host's first line of defense against severe COVID-19 identify actionable biomarkers, informing disease management or therapeutics. Yet, the innate immune response, including cytokines, chemokines, adenosine deaminases (ADAs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs), relevant to COVID-19 remain incompletely characterized.


METHODS
Peripheral blood was longitudinally collected between May 2020 and March 2021 from COVID-19 hospitalized adults (N=79) and healthy controls (HCs) (N=14; not tested, assumed COVID-negative, no viral exposure or symptoms). Heparinized blood was fractionated for plasma cryopreservation and in vitro whole blood TLR-stimulation employing TLR-3, -4, and -7/8 agonists. Post-stimulation culture supernatants were analyzed using multiplex and enzymatic assays.


RESULTS
Upon hospitalization, plasma concentrations of IFNγ, IL-6, CXCL10, and ADAs, were significantly upregulated compared to convalescent time points and HCs. Participants with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs concentrations upon admission. Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and ADAs positively correlated and associated with distinct temporal patterns. TLR-stimulated cell cultures from patients produced reduced IFNα2, IFNγ, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 compared to HCs or later time points.


CONCLUSION
Higher plasma concentrations of IL-27, CXCL10, and ADAs at admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Reduced TLR-mediated IFNα2, IFNγ, and IL-12p70 production suggests COVID dampens Th1-polarizing innate immune responses, providing insight into immunological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Complement overactivation, has been verified in COVID-19 patients. Complement regulatory proteins, including CD55, control complement overactivation thus eliminating complement deposition and cell lysis. We investigated complement regulatory protein expression in COVID-19 for potential deregulated expression patterns driving disease pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed increased PBMCs CD55 expression in severely and critically ill patients. This increase was also detected upon integrated subclustering analysis of monocyte, T cell and B cell populations. FACS analysis confirmed the significant upregulation of CD55 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocyte populations of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients. This upregulation was associated with decreased expression of type-I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, indicating a suppressor effect of CD55. Silencing of CD55 in T cells from COVID-19 severely ill patients in vitro and sensitization with SARS-CoV-2 peptides resulted in significantly augmented expression of ISGs and a reversal of their expression to levels similar to control or higher. The present study uncovers, to the best of our knowledge, a novel regulatory effect of CD55 on type-I IFN responses of severely ill COVID-19 patients, thus indicating its contribution to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and identifies a novel mechanistic pathway in the COVID-19 immune response.">

        <tr id="Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a devastating autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) with limited treatment options. Several studies have shown attenuation of the well-characterized GBS preclinical experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) model with systemically administered therapeutic compounds via anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory mechanisms. Despite this, clinical advancement of these findings is limited by dosing that is not translatable to humans or is associated with off-target and toxic effects. This is due, in part, to the blood-nerve barrier (BNB), which restricts access of the circulation to peripheral nerves. However, during acute neuroinflammation, the normally restrictive BNB exhibits increased vascular permeability and enables immune cell infiltration. This may offer a unique window to access the otherwise restricted peripheral nerve microenvironment for therapeutic delivery. Here, we assessed the degree to which BNB permeability and immune cell infiltration over the course of EAN enables accumulation of circulating nanoparticles. We found that at disease stages defined by distinct clinical scores and pathology (onset, effector phase, and peak of EAN severity), intravenously administered small molecules and nanoparticles ranging from 50 to 150 nm can permeate into the endoneurium from the endoneurial vasculature in a size- and stage-dependent manner. This permeation occurs uniformly in both sciatic nerves and in proximal and distal regions of the nerves. We propose that this nerve targeting enabled by pathology serves as a platform by which potential therapies for GBS can be reevaluated and investigated preclinically in nanoparticle delivery systems.">

        <tr id="Respiratory virus infections, such as those caused by influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronaviruses, pose a significant global health burden. While the immune system’s adaptive components, including memory T cells, are critical for recognizing and combating these pathogens, recurrent infections and variable disease outcomes persist. Memory T cells are a key element of long-term immunity, capable of responding swiftly upon re-exposure to pathogens. They play diverse roles, including cross-reactivity to conserved viral epitopes and modulation of inflammatory responses. However, the protective efficacy of these cells is influenced by several factors, including viral evolution, host age, and immune system dynamics. This review explores the dichotomy of memory T cells in respiratory virus infections: their potential to confer robust protection and the limitations that allow for breakthrough infections. Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the formation, maintenance, and functional deployment of memory T cells in respiratory mucosa is critical for improving immunological interventions. We highlight recent advances in vaccine strategies aimed at bolstering T cell-mediated immunity and discuss the challenges posed by viral immune evasion. Addressing these gaps in knowledge is pivotal for designing effective therapeutics and vaccines to mitigate the global burden of respiratory viruses.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most patients recover fully after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2. Some, however, may develop pulmonary sequelae (PS) and/or long COVID (LC). However, whether these two clinical conditions have similar or different pathogenic mechanisms is unknown. Methods The levels of autoantibodies and 184 inflammatory and organ damage associated proteins in plasma were determined (by immunofluorescence and Olink panels, respectively) 1 year after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 51 patients with PS (DLCO < 80% ref), 31 patients with LC and 31 patients fully recovered (Rec). PS was defined by the presence of reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) lower than 80% ref. LC was defined by the presence of chronic symptoms in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Results We found that patients with PS or LC both showed increased levels than Rec of anti-microbial, immune cell activation and recruitment related proteins. Patients with PS showed higher levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies, whereas LC patients had increased levels of organ-damage associated proteins. In patients with PS most of the elevated proteins correlate with the impairment of lung function (DLCO). Finally, in PS we additionally performed the determinations at an earlier time point (6 months) and showed that the expression of CCL20 and IFN-ɣ was already higher at 6 months, while CCL3 and CCL19 increase from 6 to 12 months, suggesting a pathogenic role in PS persistence. Conclusions Patients with PS or LC have abnormal but different persistent circulatory immune and organ damage biomarkers, suggesting different underlying biology of both post-COVID conditions.

        <tr id="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Des-ignated as an epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020, the virus quickly escalated to a global emergency, officially declared a pandemic in March 2020. With over 6 million recorded deaths and more than 200 identified symptoms in diverse individuals, the impact of COVID-19 is substantial. COVID-19 poses a greater risk to individuals with advanced HIV, while those with well-managed HIV are not at increased risk. Although COVID-19 vaccines are generally effective for people with HIV, some may experience reduced vaccine effectiveness and breakthrough infections due to suboptimal immune responses. Long COVID, affecting at least 65 million individuals, adds a layer of complexity. The virus's rapid mutation has led to diverse symptomatology, prompting adjustments in treatment guidelines. This review compre-hensively examines repurposed antiviral drug candidates against COVID-19, explores immune responses across different age groups, delves into the mechanisms of COVID-19 vaccines, and discusses potential immunosuppressants.

        <tr id="Introduction. The continued epidemic relevance of SARS-CoV-2, even after the end of the associated COVID-19 pandemic in 2023, necessitates further study of the interaction of this virus with the first line of cellular defense, neutrophils. 
The aim of the study was to determine the enzymatic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes of Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) in the dynamics of ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection, which characterizes the microbicidal potential of innate immunity cells. 
Materials and methods. The SARS-CoV-2/Vladivostok/R-8726/2021 strain was used at infectious doses of 3 lg (TCID50/mL) and 2 lg (TCID50/mL) (TCID50 is the 50% tissue cytopathic dose for the Vero E6 cell line); the contact time of the infecting virus-containing liquid with the cell culture was 1 h. The number of viable cells in the adherent leukocyte culture was counted using an inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera and MCView program. The specific (per 1 viable cell) activities of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), 5′-nucleotidase (adenosine monophosphatase, AMPase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and cytochrome oxidase (CCO) were determined spectrophotometrically after incubation with specific substrates of infected and uninfected cell cultures 1, 16, 24, 48 h after virus inoculation. 
Results. The enzymatic activity of leukocytes 1 h after virus inoculation, compared to uninfected leukocytes, was as follows: specific activity of ATPase, MPO was decreased, activity of AMPase, LDH, SDH was increased; 16 h after virus inoculation, activity of MPO was decreased, activity of AMPase, LDH, SDH was increased, activity of ATPase and CCO was at the initial level, i.e. approximately at the level of the uninfected control; 24 h after virus inoculation, AMPase activity was decreased, ATPase activity was increased, LDH, SDH, MPO, CCO activity was at the initial level; 48 h after virus inoculation, ATPase, LDH, SDH, MPO, CCO activity was increased, AMPase activity was at the initial level. Changes in enzymatic activity depend on the infecting dose and correlate with virus accumulation in the culture medium. 
Conclusion. The revealed dynamics of enzymatic activity in the primary culture of adherent leukocytes ex vivo infected with SARS-CoV-2 indicates a decrease in the microbicidal potential of cells of innate immunity in the course of this infection.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has profound systemic effects, including significant impacts on the central nervous system (CNS). Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation and the exacerbation or initiation of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This review explores the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to neurodegenerative processes. We first discuss the pathways of viral entry into the CNS, including transneuronal and hematogenous routes, leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Neuroinflammation, mediated by the activation of microglia and astrocytes and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, is highlighted as a critical factor exacerbating neuronal damage. Oxidative stress and vascular damage are further examined as complementary mechanisms promoting neurodegeneration. In addition, we review how SARS-CoV-2 infection influences proteinopathies by accelerating the aggregation of pathological proteins like alpha-synuclein, tau, and TDP-43, contributing to disease progression in PD, AD, and related disorders. Clinical studies reporting cognitive and motor dysfunctions in post-COVID-19 patients with pre-existing neurodegenerative diseases are also summarized. Finally, this review identifies knowledge gaps and emphasizes the need for further research to clarify the long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the risk of neurodegeneration in vulnerable populations.">

        <tr id="Introduction Severe COVID-19 is characterized by hyperimmune host responses contributing to airway damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Type III interferons (IFN), including IFN lambda 4 (IFNλ4), expressed in individuals harboring the rs368234815-ΔG allele, are implicated in host immune responses to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Methods We investigated associations between IFNλ4 expression through genotyping and COVID-19 disease severity in 853 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases enrolled in the All-Ireland Infectious Diseases Cohort. Additionally, we measured plasma levels of Type I, II and III IFN using quantitative immunoassays along with IFNλ4 expression and COVID-19 disease severity in a sub-group [n=321 (37.6%)] with samples available within 10 days of symptom onset. IFNλ4 was expressed in 382 (44.8%) but expression was not significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Results Within the sub-group, we found no consistent associations between IFNλ4 expression and circulating IFNs. However, we observed significantly increased expression of IFNλ1 and IFNλ2 in severe COVID-19 (P<0.01), with IFNλ2 remaining significantly associated after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, including obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) (P<0.001). Interestingly, although IFNλ2 levels were significantly higher in subjects with obesity, the association between higher IFNλ2 and COVID-19 disease severity was only observed in individuals without obesity (P<0.01). Conclusion These data reveal an important role for IFNλ2 as an immune correlate that predicts COVID-19 disease severity, which may be masked in those with obesity.">

        <tr id="Background Acute lung injury (ALI), including its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a common cause of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Although its clinical characteristics have been well characterized, the relevant mechanism remains unclear. An imbalance in autophagy leads to alveolar remodeling and triggers the pathogenesis of ARDS. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine (Fluda) in ALI. C57BL6 mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and their lung tissues were analyzed via next-generation transcriptome sequencing. Results Western blotting revealed that interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) was highly expressed and STAT1 was phosphorylated following LPS exposure. Fluda significantly decreased the protein expression of STAT1/IRF1 and inhibited the alveolar infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages. Nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release was decreased in the lungs of mice and RAW264.7 macrophages following Fluda treatment. In LPS-induced GFP-LC3 transgenic mice treated with Fluda, the counts of LC3-expressing neutrophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid were significantly decreased. Furthermore, Fluda decreased LC3 and p62 protein expression, thereby inhibiting the release of NO, IL-6, and TNF-α in BAL. In RAW264.7 cells, the inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda decreased LPS-induced ERK and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Conclusions The inhibition of STAT1/IRF1 by Fluda plays a pivotal role in modulating dysregulated autophagy by suppressing the MAPK and NF-κB p65 pathways in ALI.

        <tr id="Impaired spermatogenesis has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on male fertility remains unclear. The purpose of this multicenter study was to investigate the possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility and determine the potential reasons leading to impaired male reproductive functions. In silico approach identified ~60 amino acid sequences containing at least five continuous residues shared by SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and spermatogenesis-linked proteins. Four synthetic peptides were tested with sera from independent cohorts of patients with acute and long COVID-19 syndrome (LCS), and naïve vaccinated subjects. Immunogenicity and pathogenicity studies were performed by immunizing mice with two selected peptides and testing the antigenicity of induced antibodies. While none of four peptides were recognized by antibodies from vaccinated people, infected patients exhibited high reactivity to peptide 4, and LCS patients, especially women, showed elevated antibody levels against peptide 2. Women with LCS and chronic fatigue syndrome had higher levels of peptide 2–reacting antibodies than those with idiopathic chronic fatigue syndrome. Noteworthy, peptide 2 antibodies showed, in in vitro experiment, a specific interaction with mouse testicular tissue antigens. These findings raise the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and spermatogenesis-related antigens may affect infected patients’ fertility, suggesting a potential for autoimmune responses with human consequences.">

        <tr id="Background The manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection range from flu-like symptoms to severe lung disease. The consequences of this inflammatory process impact overall function, which can be detected through both short- to long-term assessments. This study aimed to assess the pulmonary functional and structural characteristics of post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with mild/moderate, severe, and critical clinical presentations. Methods An observational, analytical, and cross-sectional study was conducted between 2020 and 2022, including participants with a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, with mild/moderate (G1), severe (G2), and critical (G3) clinical presentations, all evaluated at least 3 months after acute infection. Spirometry, impulse oscillometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), chest computed tomography, the 6-min walk test (6MWT), hand grip strength, maximum inspiratory pressure, and maximum expiratory pressure were assessed. Results We enrolled 210 participants aged 18–70 years, 32.6% of whom were male, with older age observed in G3. The participants were grouped as follows: G1 (42.3%), G2 (25.7%), and G3 (31.9%). Percentage of predicted X5 differed between G1 and G2, being higher in G1. The percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) according to the Global Lung Function Initiative and its z-score were higher in G1. The FVC by Pereira was lower in G3 compared to G1. The percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) by Pereira was also lower in G3. The Tiffeneau (FEV1/FVC) index was different among groups, increasing with disease severity. The percentage of predicted forced expiratory flow rate at 25–75% (FEF25-75%) of the FVC and FeNO were both higher in G2 than G1. Chest computed tomography revealed the presence of interstitial abnormalities, associated with disease severity. The respiratory muscle strength evaluation showed an association between higher maximum expiratory pressure values in G3 compared to G1, but no association with maximum inspiratory pressure was observed. The 6MWT distance covered decreased with increasing severity, with a lower percentage of predicted values in G3 compared to G1. The right-hand grip strength was also lower in G3 compared to G1. Conclusion Alterations in pulmonary and functional markers were observed in post-COVID-19 evaluations, increasing with disease severity, as seen in G2 and G3. These findings highlight the complexity of post-COVID-19 functional assessments, given the long-term pulmonary sequelae and the consequent impairment of functional capacity.">

        <tr id="The immune characteristics and pathological mechanisms of COVID‐19 and tuberculosis coinfection are not well understood. Single‐cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting complex immune responses and cellular interactions in infectious diseases. Here, we employed scRNA‐seq, combined with laboratory examinations and clinical observations, to elucidate potential mechanisms of immunopathology and protective immunity in coinfected patients. Substantial alterations in immune cell populations in patients with severe coinfection were observed, characterized by severe lymphopenia and massive expansion of myeloid cells. Lymphocytopenia may have resulted from lymphocyte apoptosis and migration. Systemic upregulation of S100 family proteins, mainly released by classical monocytes, might contribute to inflammatory cytokine storm via S100‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway in severely coinfected patients. Myeloid cells may contribute to immune paralysis in severe cases through expansion of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and dysregulated dendritic cell function. The immune landscape of T cells in severe patients were featured by dysregulated Th1 response, widespread exhaustion and increased cytotoxic, apoptosis, migration and inflammatory states. We observed increased plasma cells and overexpression of B‐cell‐activation‐related pathways in severe patients. Together, we provide a comprehensive atlas illustrating the immune response to coinfected patients at the single‐cell resolution and highlight mechanisms of pathogenesis in severe patients.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a major global health crisis with widespread effects on healthcare, society, and economies. Initially seen as a respiratory illness, it is now recognized as a multisystem disease, with growing evidence of its impact on the nervous system. 
Neurological complications - such as cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and mood disorders - have been reported in both severe and mild COVID-19 cases, highlighting the unpredictable nature of post-COVID sequelae. These symptoms can persist long after the acute phase of infection. 
The mechanisms behind these effects are complex and not yet fully understood. They include direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, immune dysregulation (e.g., cytokine storm, autoimmunity), and blood–brain barrier disruption, all of which may lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. 
The long-term neurological consequences pose significant clinical and societal challenges, requiring multidisciplinary care and tailored rehabilitation strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches, aiming to inform evidence-based post-COVID care.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the virus’s unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish it from other respiratory pathogens. It is known that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) activates a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell survival, contributing to the wide range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of HIF-1α is a key driver of systemic inflammation, silent hypoxia, and pathological tissue remodeling in both the acute and post-acute phases of the disease. This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in INPLASY. It involved a literature search in Scopus and PubMed, supplemented by manual reference screening, with study selection facilitated by Rayyan software. Our analysis clarifies the dual role of HIF-1α, which may either worsen inflammatory responses and viral persistence or support adaptive mechanisms that reduce cellular damage. The potential for targeting HIF-1α therapeutically in COVID-19 is complex, requiring further investigation to clarify its precise role and translational applications. This review deepens the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue dysfunction in hypoxia, offering insights for improving clinical management strategies and addressing long-term sequelae.">

In addition, c-ABL targeting attenuates F-actin reorganization induced by DENV infection. Together with the involvement of c-ABL in endothelial dysfunction induced by DENV and host secreted factors, our findings strongly suggest that c-ABL is a potential host-targeted antiviral that could control DENV infection and/or its evolution to more severe forms of the disease.">

Limited data exist regarding antibody responses to breakthrough infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS‐CoV‐2. This study aimed to compare antibody levels and their relationships with clinical features in patients with breakthrough infections.Sera from patients with breakthrough infections were analyzed for IgG, IgM, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) using a fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. Antibody levels were then compared and correlated with clinical features.Booster COVID‐19 vaccination was associated with higher levels of NAb and IgG in breakthrough‐infected individuals (β = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12–0.90, and β = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.35–1.33, respectively). Individuals infected with the Delta variant exhibited higher IgM and IgA levels compared with those infected with the Omicron variant (β = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.46–1.14, and β = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.13–0.98, respectively). The SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA clearance time was negatively correlated with NAb and IgG levels in Delta infections (correlation coefficient rs = −0.31 and −0.26, respectively) and Omicron infections (rs = −0.29 and −0.32, respectively).Patients with breakthrough infections of the Delta variant exhibited higher IgM and IgA levels than those with breakthrough infections of the Omicron variant. Elevated NAb and IgG levels, associated with booster COVID‐19 vaccination, correlated with shorter SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA clearance times. These findings underscore the enhanced immunogenicity of booster vaccination in mitigating the duration of viral RNA positivity.">

        <tr id="Cognitive dysfunction represents one of the most persistent and disabling features of Long COVID, yet its molecular underpinnings remain incompletely understood. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term neurocognitive sequelae. Key processes include persistent neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and neuroendocrine imbalance. Microglial activation and cytokine release (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) promote synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury, while activation of inflammasomes such as NLRP3 amplifies CNS inflammation. Vascular abnormalities, including microthrombosis and BBB leakage, facilitate the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and neurotoxic mediators. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysfunction and reduced vagal tone further exacerbate systemic inflammation and autonomic imbalance. Biomarkers such as GFAP, NFL, IL-6, and S100B have been associated with both neuroinflammation and cognitive symptoms. Notably, transcriptomic signatures in Long COVID overlap with those observed in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting shared pathways involving tau dysregulation, oxidative stress, and glial reactivity. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for identifying at-risk individuals and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. This review underscores the need for longitudinal research and integrative biomarker analysis to elucidate the molecular trajectory of cognitive impairment in Long COVID.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global population. The infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, presents with a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic cases to more severe forms, including a variety of neurological symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, brain fog, paresthesias, dysautonomia, anosmia, and dysgeusia. Additionally, the disease is associated with the long COVID syndrome, in which there is persistence of the effects and symptoms of the acute phase. In recent years the literature has shown relevant data on long COVID, but there is still a need to deepen the knowledge about these long term manifestations. Thus, the present study aimed to describe the main neurological sequelae resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-hospitalized population during the long phase of the disease, gathering scientific evidence through an integrative review of the prevalence of symptoms, patient profile, duration and severity of sequelae, risk factors, comorbidities, and possible nervous system structural damage. The PubMed/Medline database was used with descriptors and, at the end of the screening process with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 studies were included. A group of neurological symptoms associated with long COVID was identified: myalgia, dysgeusia, memory alterations, olfactory dysfunction, dizziness, and pain. Most patients presented multiple symptoms that lasted for more than one year with a significant impact on quality of life. The main risk factors were dyslipidemia, age, ethnicity, muscle/ joint pain, and sex.

We describe clinical symptoms, chemokine, cytokine, metabolomic and lipidomic derangements in a systemic mastocytosis patient following mRNA-1273 booster vaccination. Methods Twenty-eight chemokines and cytokines, 41 amino acids and 16 lipid classes were quantified with state-of-the-art methods. Results Mast cell activation (MCA) symptoms started 24 h after the mRNA-1273 booster vaccination with significant metabolic, lipidomic and cytokine derangements. Histamine concentrations peaked at life-threatening 18 ng/ml concomitant with high tryptase. Peak plasma IL-1Ra, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, CXCL10 and GM-CSF concentrations were elevated 54-, 4.9-, 85-, 54-, 6.1-, 19- and 6.4-fold respectively. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was administered 6 h after admission, because of the highly elevated IL-6 concentrations. More than one year later IL-6 was highly elevated during another MCA attack likely caused by a PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and tocilizumab was again used. Clinical symptoms improved during the following 12 h similar to the vaccine booster MCA attack. Conclusions A mRNA-1273 first booster vaccination likely caused a delayed severe MCA attack with highly elevated Th2-biased cytokines with metabolic and lipidomic derangements. Administration of an IL-6 receptor blocker during both MCA attacks might have shortened the duration of clinical symptoms.

Despite substantial advancements in preventing severe COVID-19 cases through vaccination, the rise in the prevalence of long COVID syndrome and a notable degree of genomic mutation, primarily in the S protein, underscores the necessity for a deeper understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms related to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, the latest part of this series, we investigate the potential pathophysiological molecular mechanisms triggered by the interaction between the spike protein and cellular receptors. Therefore, this review aims to provide a differential and focused view on the mechanisms potentially activated by the binding of the spike protein to canonical and non-canonical receptors for SARS-CoV-2, together with their possible interactions and effects on the pathogenesis of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Introduction. It is now known that 30% of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 develop long-COVID. According to researchers, the reactivation of herpesviruses plays a significant role in triggering long-COVID. In these patients, alteration in lymphocyte populations and T-lymphocyte subpopulations have been observed, yet the nature of these changes remains unclear. The dysregulation of the immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 is further exacerbated by the reactivation of human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6). Therefore, it is essential to distinguish immune response alterations in long-COVID patients based on HHV-6 reactivation and consider these differences when developing therapeutic approaches. 
The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the associative relationships between the number of lymphocyte populations, T-lymphocyte subpopulations, and the severity of the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with long-COVID; 2) to determine and compare the percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD56+, CD8+, CD4/25/127– T-regs and CD19+ cells in long-COVID patients depending on the presence of reactivated HHV-6. 
Materials and methods. In our study, we examined 124 patients, including 73 women (59%) and 51 men (41%), with an average age of 43±9.70 years, all of whom had suffered from COVID-19 in the second half of 2023. To confirm HHV-6 reactivation and form study groups, molecular genetic studies (PCR) were conducted on all patients. Subsequently, flow cytometry was used to analyze the lymphocyte populations and subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from the patients. 
Results. In patients with long-COVID following severe COVID-19, the percentage of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ cells, and CD4+CD25+CD127– T-regs was significantly lower both in the absence of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.014; p=0.016; p=0.045, respectively) and during the active phase of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.045; p=0.005; p=0.008, respectively), compared to the control group. CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased only during the active phase of the herpesvirus (p=0.045). Notably, in the active phase of HHV-6, these cells were further reduced compared to those without herpesvirus reactivation. Additionally, the number of CD19+ B cells was significantly elevated in patients with HHV-6 reactivation, compared to both the control group (p<0.0001) and patients without HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0002). Furthermore, the percentage of CD56+ NK cells in patients with long- COVID following mild and moderate COVID-19 in the history, without HHV-6 reactivation, did not differ significantly from the control group. However, NK cells were significantly lower in patients with long-COVID after severe COVID-19 in the context of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0001). 
Conclusions. Our data confirm that HHV-6 reactivation after COVID-19 plays a role in the development of long-COVID. This is mediated through dysregulation of adaptive immune cell interactions, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and increased production of antibodies with defective structure. Based on our results, patients with long- COVID following severe COVID-19, in the context of HHV-6 reactivation, may have an elevated risk of immunopathological complications, potentially including autoimmune disorders. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background As part of the innate immune system, NK cells contribute to optimizing cancer immunotherapy strategies and are becoming a focal point in cancer research. However, limited research has been conducted to further investigate changes in NK cell subsets and their critical genes following ibrutinib treatment in CLL patients. Methods Peripheral blood samples from patients clinically and pathologically diagnosed with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), newly diagnosed with CLL (ND-CLL), postibrutinib-treated patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and those with Richter's syndrome (RS) were collected. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing was performed, followed by pseudotemporal analysis and functional enrichment to characterize the NK cell subsets. Mendelian randomization analysis and colocalization analysis were employed to identify key genes. Multiple algorithms were used for immune infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis was conducted to pinpoint potential therapeutic agents. Results Three distinct NK cell subsets were identified: CD56bright_NK cells, CD56dim_NK cells, and a highly cytotoxic CLL_NK subset. The core genes of the CLL_NK subset were elucidated through Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses. A cell subset-specific novel index (CNI) was constructed based on these core genes and was shown to be capable of predicting responses to immunotherapy. Oncopredictive algorithms and molecular docking screenings further identified semaxanib and ulixertinib as potential therapeutic candidates for CLL. Conclusion The CLL_NK subset plays a crucial role in the development and progression of CLL. The CNI, derived from its key genes, holds promise as a predictor of immune therapeutic responses, highlighting the significance of CLL_NK subset dynamics and their genetic underpinnings in CLL management.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound global impact. Therapeutic strategies to bridge the crucial 'lockdown' timespan between the emergence of a new virus and vaccine rollout are needed.


METHODS
We recently demonstrated that intranasal (i.n.) administration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in sentinel hamsters can limit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from acutely infected index littermates. The current study investigates if functional immunity develops during i.n. prophylaxis in the same model.


RESULTS
Lung tissue was free from infectious virus and pneumonia in sentinel hamsters after i.n. CCP prophylaxis, unlike those receiving non-immune control plasma (NIP). However, throat swabs from both groups contained viral RNA similar to intentionally infected index littermates. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies were detected in plasma from both sentinel groups two days after it showed in index littermates. This immune response was functional because all sentinel hamsters were protected from reinfection by the same viral strain.


CONCLUSION
Our findings demonstrate that i.n. CCP prophylaxis prevents lung disease in hamsters by restraining the infection to the upper respiratory tract, while still promoting a functional humoral immune response that protects against reinfection.">

It affects multiple systems, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are known to be susceptible to COVID-19. Surprisingly, there is a certain correlation and similarity between these two diseases to some extent. In this study, we performed a systematic review of relevant studies published on PubMed from December 2019 to January 2023 from the aspects of the clinical features of SLE patients with COVID-19, the immunological similarities between COVID-19 and SLE, the prevention and therapeutic approach of SLE patients with COVID-19, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SLE patients. Our findings indicate that SLE patients at higher risk of COVID-19 infection than the general population, and SLE patients treated with glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants have a higher rate of hospitalization. Consequently, the use of immunosuppressants during COVID-19 infection in SLE patients is of concern and additional treatment approaches should be explored. Moreover, SLE patients with COVID-19 also face challenges in accessing healthcare, financial hardship, and psychological distress. These issues require further attention and can be addressed by providing telemedicine, ensuring adequate supplies of medicines and promoting psychological well-beings. Together, this article summarizes the correlation and similarity between SLE and COVID-19, and provides a detailed and practical guide for the prevention, treatment and nursing of SLE patients with COVID-19. Moreover, this article also discusses the fields that require further research and provide reference for the management of other autoimmune diseases in the case of viral infection.">

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, recent findings indicate that it also significantly disrupts the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, contributing to disease severity, systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections and chronic conditions. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, exacerbates the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and has been linked to long-COVID, a condition affecting a significant proportion of survivors and manifesting with over 200 symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the growing recognition of microbiome alterations in COVID-19, the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the microbiome and influences disease progression remain poorly understood. This narrative review investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-microbiota dynamics and evaluates its implications in disease severity and for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

Peripheral blood cytokine profiles may predict the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but none have been identified in US Veterans. Methods We analyzed peripheral blood cytokine profiles from 202 participants in the EPIC3 study, a prospective observational cohort of US Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 across 15 VA medical centers. Illness severity was assessed based on the highest level documented during the first 60 days after recruitment. We correlated cytokine levels with illness severity using LASSO logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models on a 70% training set and calculated the AUC on a 30% test set. Results LASSO regression identified 6 cytokines as predictors of SARS-CoV-2 severity with 77.3% AUC in the test set. Random forest and XGBoost models achieved an AUC of 80.4% and 80.7% in the test set, respectively. All models assigned a feature importance to each cytokine, with IP-10, MCP-1, and HGF consistently identified as key markers. Conclusions Cytokine profiles are predictive of SARS-CoV-2 severity in US Veterans and may guide tailored interventions for improved patient management.

        <tr id="Dengue is an important tropical disease with considerable global impact. Despite this, there remains an urgent need for reliable biomarkers to predict disease severity, as well as effective antiviral drugs and targeted treatments. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of 41 plasma mediators in patients with asymptomatic dengue (AD) and symptomatic dengue (SD), which includes mild dengue fever (DF) and severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Our findings revealed that the levels of nearly all measured mediators were consistently lower in AD compared to SD patients, suggesting a potential protective cytokine response signature. Time-course cytokine analysis in SD shown significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammation and viral clearance upon the acute phase, while various growth factors were elevated during the convalescence. Notably, we identified elevated IL-15 levels in DHF patients three days before fever subsidence, highlighting its potential as an early prognostic biomarker for severe disease outcomes. Furthermore, prolonged high levels of IL-8 and IP-10 in DHF during the critical period may contribute to dengue immunopathogenesis. This study advances the understanding of cytokine dynamics in the natural course of human dengue infection, providing valuable insights for the development of targeted treatments and prognostic biomarkers.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that devastated the world. While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. The present study examined the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using large sample sizes and provides mechanistic information through histological observations. We studied 56 postmortal lung samples from COVID-19 patients. The comparative group consisted of 17 postmortal lung samples from patients who died of influenza A virus subtype H1N1. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis, and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of the pulmonary arterial walls. These results demonstrate that COVID-19 significantly affected the pulmonary vasculature in fatal-course patients, also suggesting the need for careful follow-up in non-fatal cases, at risk of pulmonary hypertension.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has had a profound global impact and continues to represent a health challenge worldwide. The durability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) patients receiving biologic therapies is unknown. This study aimed to quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses post vaccination in these immunosuppressed patients over 12 months. Methods: Prospective study comparing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in PIBD patients aged 5–18 years treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) therapies with or without an immunomodulator (IM) versus vedolizumab. Results: Between 1 May 2021 and 1 May 2022, 194 participants on anti-TNF monotherapy (n = 78), anti-TNF with IM (n = 83), vedolizumab (n = 15), and steroids (n = 18) were recruited. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike levels increased after the first vaccine and were further boosted 1 month after the second dose. Linear mixed-effects modelling showed antibody waning over time (effect difference −2509 IgG AU/mL per week [95%CI: −4998–−20, p = 0.048]), counterbalanced by booster doses (effect difference 184,138 IgG AU/mL per additional vaccine dose [95%CI: 138,342–229,934, p < 0.001]). Receiving anti-TNF therapy contributed to reduced antibody responses compared to vedolizumab (anti-TNF monotherapy effect difference: −212,640 [95%CI: −336,928–−88,351] p = 0.001; anti-TNF with IM: −151,880 [95%CI: −277,309–−26,451] p = 0.018). Seroconversion and breakthrough infection rates were similar between groups, and all infections were mild, without hospitalizations. Conclusions: Although SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were attenuated in PIBD patients receiving anti-TNF therapy compared with vedolizumab, this did not impact protection, as seroconversion and breakthrough infection rates were similar, with no hospitalizations. These data reinforce the importance of updating vaccines and, in particular, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in immunosuppressed PIBD patients on advanced therapies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Individuals with comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis patients (HDP), are particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 and to its complications. Furthermore, their immune response to vaccines is impaired, requiring tailored vaccination strategies. In this study, we investigated through transcriptomic profiling the immune response heterogeneity of HDP vaccinated with two doses of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Methods Transcriptomic analyses were conducted in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from HDP and healthy controls (HC) before and 7 days after each dose. The HDP were stratified into high- and low-responders based on their humoral response after the second dose. Results Significant differences in gene expression related to B cell abundance and regulation, CD4 T cell proliferation, and inflammation pathways were observed at baseline and day 7 between HDP-low responders and HC, while the HDP high-responders displayed an intermediate expression profile for these genes. Discussion Results were consistent with the known immunologic alterations occurring in HDP cohorts related to lymphopenia, chronic inflammation, and dysregulated proliferation of CD4+. Our analyses identified an early transcriptional signature correlated with a diminished immune response in HDP low-responders, highlighting the importance of conducting a characterization of immunocompromised cohorts.">

        <tr id="The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become an important global health issue. Nonetheless, recent studies indicate its possibility as an oncolytic virus for cancer treatment. SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that infects the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are expressed in certain cancer cells. The expressive nature of the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 can infect in cancer cells can lead to selective infection of the virus in cancer cells and also selectively destroy the tumor cells by cytopathic effects. On top of that, the tumor cells' death from viral replication changes the tumor environment. This immunomodulatory effect changes the immune response from one that suppresses to one that enhances immunity against tumors. Moreover, scientists have looked at ways to use chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology to direct viral infections toward cancer cells for improved specificity. However, problems also exist, such as fast viral clearance and antiviral immunity, which limit effectiveness over the long term. Using viruses to kill cancer cells is still a good way to target untreatable and widespread cancers. It will not only kill cancer cells but may also trigger the immune system. Moving forward with this may help create better cancer therapies.">

 Cytokines, secreted by immune cells, are essential for coordinating immune responses against pathogens and abnormal cells, such as those found in cancer. Despite their critical role, a comprehensive understanding of how many different types of immune cells respond to individual cytokines remains elusive. To begin to address this challenge, we created a comprehensive single cell atlas of immune responses to 90 cytokines, profiling the single cell transcriptomes of 10 million PBMCs from 12 donors after 24 hours of treatment. We identified 18 cell types, resulting in the analysis of 19, 440 experimental conditions. Our analysis revealed gene expression changes that are both cell type- and donor-specific, uncovering responses even in rare immune cell populations that are difficult to capture in smaller datasets. Furthermore, we also identified a small number of cytokines that induced changes in cell type proportions after cytokine treatment. Given the limited number of publicly available large-scale single cell studies, we also provide an updated, detailed analysis workflow to encourage researchers to produce similarly scaled-up datasets. By sharing this comprehensive dataset and methodology, we aim to empower the scientific community to scale single cell experiments and drive advancements in immunology, immuno-oncology, cancer biology, and beyond.

        <tr id="In people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, PLWH), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine often results in a limited humoral immune response. While a reduced absolute CD4+ T cell count is a known factor, other determinants remain unclear. To investigate variables influencing the differential antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine in PLWH, 43 HIV-1/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers. A retrospective analysis was also performed, examining immune reconstitution and epidemiological history, including annual CD4+ T-cell counts and the duration of HIV-1 infection. To further elucidate the role of CD4+ T cells in the antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine, next-generation sequencing was used to analyze the T cell receptor (TCR) profiles of CD4+ T cells from twelve representative individuals. The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response in PLWH was not solely determined by the current CD4+ T cell count, the progression of immune reconstitution and the TCR profile of CD4+ T cells also played significant roles. These findings provide critical insights into the multifaceted roles of CD4+ T cells in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in PLWH following COVID-19 vaccination.">

With these delicate dynamics in mind, immunomodulatory therapies have emerged as a promising avenue for mitigating the challenges posed by COVID-19. Precision in manipulating immune pathways presents an opportunity to alter the host response, optimizing antiviral defenses while curbing deleterious inflammation. This review article comprehensively analyzes immunomodulatory interventions in managing COVID-19. We explore diverse approaches to mitigating the hyperactive immune response and its impact, from corticosteroids and non-steroidal drugs to targeted biologics, including anti-viral drugs, cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, cell-based therapies (i.e., CAR T, etc.).

HCoV infections primarily affect the respiratory system, leading to symptoms such as dry cough, fever, and breath shortness, which can progress to acute respiratory failure and death. Beyond respiratory effects, increasing evidence links HCoVs to neurological dysfunction. However, distinguishing direct neural complications from preexisting disorders, particularly in the elderly, remains challenging. This study examines the association between HCoVs and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It also presents the long-term neurological effects of HCoV infections and their differential impact across age groups and sexes. A key aspect of this study is the investigation of the sequence and structural similarities between amyloidogenic and HCoV spike proteins, which can provide insights into potential neuropathomechanisms.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a potentially deadly superinfection in patients with influenza pneumonia, especially those with severe disease, underlying immunosuppression, corticosteroid therapy, or requiring intensive care support. Given the high mortality of IAPA, adjunct immunomodulatory strategies remain a critical unmet need. Previously, the desensitization of pattern recognition pathways has been described as a hallmark of IAPA pathogenesis and a predictor of mortality in IAPA patients. Therefore, we studied the impact of nebulized Toll-like receptor 2/6/9 agonists Pam2 CSK4 (Pam2) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) on infection outcomes and pulmonary immunopathology in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed murine IAPA model. Mice with IAPA receiving mock therapy showed rapidly progressing disease and a paralyzed immune response to secondary Aspergillus fumigatus infection. Nebulized Pam2ODN was well tolerated and significantly prolonged event-free survival. Specifically, dual-dose Pam2ODN therapy before and after A. fumigatus infection led to 81% survival and full recovery of all survivors. Additionally, transcriptional analysis of lung tissue homogenates revealed induction of pattern recognition receptor signaling and several key effector cytokine pathways after Pam2ODN therapy. Moreover, transcriptional and flow cytometric analyses suggested increased frequencies of macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells in the lungs of Pam2ODN-treated mice. Collectively, immunomodulatory treatment with nebulized Pam2ODN strongly improved morbidity and mortality outcomes and alleviated paralyzed antifungal immunity in an otherwise lethal IAPA model. These findings suggest that Pam2ODN might be a promising candidate for locally delivered immunomodulatory therapy to improve outcomes of virus-associated mold infections such as IAPA. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant healthcare burden, morbidity, and mortality caused by secondary fungal pneumonias. Given the heightened prevalence of severe viral pneumonias, such as influenza, and poor outcomes of secondary mold pneumonias, adjunct immunotherapies are needed to prevent and treat secondary infections. We herein demonstrate severely paralyzed immunity to secondary Aspergillus fumigatus infection in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mouse model of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA), partially due to dysregulated pathogen-sensing pathways. To overcome immune paralysis and IAPA progression, we used a dyad of nebulized immunomodulators (Toll-like receptor agonists). Nebulized immunotherapy significantly improved morbidity and mortality compared to mock therapy, increased frequencies of mature mononuclear phagocytes and natural killer cells in the lung, and stimulated antimicrobial signaling. Collectively, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of locally delivered immunomodulatory therapy to alleviate virus-induced immune dysregulation in the lung and improve outcomes of post-viral mold pneumonias such as IAPA. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the significant healthcare burden, morbidity, and mortality caused by secondary fungal pneumonias. Given the heightened prevalence of severe viral pneumonias, such as influenza, and poor outcomes of secondary mold pneumonias, adjunct immunotherapies are needed to prevent and treat secondary infections. We herein demonstrate severely paralyzed immunity to secondary Aspergillus fumigatus infection in a corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mouse model of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA), partially due to dysregulated pathogen-sensing pathways.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi leads to Chagas disease that induces profound changes in the immune response across different cell subsets, influencing parasite control and disease pathology. Dissecting the functional characteristics of distinct immune cells in patients with the asymptomatic (indeterminate - IND) or with the cardiac (CCC) clinical forms is crucial for unveiling mechanisms of disease progression and pathology and identifying disease markers.


METHODS
Here, immune-gene targeted single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from IND and CCC patients to unravel the immune landscape in this polar, well-characterized, clinical groups.


RESULTS
Our findings revealed different myeloid and lymphoid cell clusters in both cohorts, each exhibiting unique gene expression patterns. CCC was characterized by an increased frequency of KLRB1+CD4+, TBX21+CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, which exhibited upregulation of genes associated with cytotoxic and apoptotic responses. Furthermore, we observed monocyte, B cell subsets, along with dendritic cells, expressing inflammatory and notably cytotoxic genes.


CONCLUSIONS
These results reveal cell-specific changes in CCC compared to IND chronic Chagas disease patients, highlighted by distinct gene expression patterns. These nuanced changes indicate immune signature linked to the clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease, which provide information regarding disease pathology, indicating potential markers related to the disease progression.">

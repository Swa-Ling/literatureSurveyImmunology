        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can have multiple etiologies, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or, rarely, mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from patients with myocarditis unrelated to COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19), after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Post-COVID-19) and after COVID-19 vaccination (Post-Vaccination). We identified distinct cytokine expression patterns, with interferon-γ playing a key role in Post-COVID-19, and upregulated IL16 and IL18 expression serving as a hallmark of Post-Vaccination myocarditis. Although myeloid responses were similar across all groups, the Post-Vaccination group showed a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells, and the Post-COVID-19 group exhibited an expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ T and natural killer cells. Endothelial cells showed gene expression changes indicative of vascular barrier dysfunction in the Post-COVID-19 group and ongoing angiogenesis across all groups. These findings highlight shared and distinct mechanisms driving myocarditis in patients with and without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T-cells are essential for controlling and resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet their antigen-specific resolution in relation to disease severity, functional dynamics during acute infection, and long-term memory formation remain incompletely understood. Using comprehensive longitudinal profiling of 553 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic antigens across globally prevalent HLAs, we identified antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses that were either critical for early viral clearance or associated with severe disease outcomes. During acute infection, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a broader and more robust CD8+ T-cell response than those with mild disease. Notably, we identified HLA-A1-restricted immunodominant antigen-specific T-cells strongly associated with severe disease. These T-cells were present at extremely high frequencies but showed significantly reduced expression of cytotoxic molecules at both the transcriptomic (PRF1, GZMB, GZMH, GNLY) and protein levels (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2), as revealed by multidimensional single-cell and cytokine profiling. In contrast, patients with mild disease had T-cells that recognized a more restricted set of antigens, showed only partial overlap with those in severe cases, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity, along with enrichment in gene sets associated with cytotoxic function, hypoxia, and glycolysis. Furthermore, the long-term memory CD8+ T-cells were maintained for a limited subset of immunodominant antigens, with their persistence correlating with their initial frequency during infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination following infection expanded the long-term T-cell repertoire by enhancing pre-existing responses and generating de novo responses, regardless of prior disease severity. These findings resolve the antigen-specific kinetics and durability of CD8+ T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide key insights into their functional landscape. This knowledge could inform future vaccine strategies and therapeutic interventions to enhance protective immunity against emerging viral threats.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 7 million lives worldwide and has been associated with prolonged inflammation, immune dysregulation and persistence of symptoms following severe infection. Understanding the T cell mediated immune response and factors impacting development and continuity of SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cells is pivotal for developing better therapeutic and monitoring strategies for those most at risk from COVID-19. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of memory T cells in a convalescent cohort (n=20), three months post Omicron infection. Utilising flow cytometry to investigate CD4+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO+ memory T cell IL-2 expression following Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1) peptide pool stimulation, alongside T cell receptor repertoire profiling and RNA-Seq analysis, we have identified several immunological features associated with hospitalised status. We observed that while there was no significant difference in median CD4+CD45RO+ IL-2+ and CD8+ CD45RO+ IL-2+ memory T cell count between subgroups, the hospitalised subgroup expressed significantly more IL-2 per cell following Omicron peptide pool exposure in the CD8+CD45RO+ population (p <0.03) and trended towards significance in CD4+CD45RO+ cells (p <0.06). T cell receptor repertoire analysis found that the non-hospitalised subgroup had a much higher number of circulating clonotypes, targeting a wider range of predominantly MHC-I epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several immunodominant epitopes, conserved between both subgroups, were observed, however hospitalised individuals were less likely to express putative HLA alleles responsible for pMHC presentation which may impact TCR affinity. We observed a bias towards shorter CDR3 segments in TCRβ repertoire analysis within the hospitalised subgroup, alongside lower rates of repertoire overlap in CDR3 sequences compared to the non-hospitalised subgroup. We found a significant proportion of TCRs targeted epitopes along the SARS-CoV-2 genome including non-structural proteins, responsible for viral replication and immune evasion. These findings highlight how the continuity of T cell based protective immunity is impacted by both the viral replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 upon intracellular and innate immune responses, and HLA-type upon TCR affinity and clonotype formation. Our novel Epitope Target Analysis Pipeline (Epi-TAP) could prove beneficial in development of new therapeutic strategies through rapid identification of shared immunodominant epitopes across non-hospitalised and hospitalised subgroups.">

        <tr id="Background The durability of vaccine-induced immune memory to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial for preventing infection, especially severe disease. Methods This follow-up report from a phase 1/2 study of S-268019-b (a recombinant spike protein vaccine) after homologous booster vaccination confirms its long-term safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. Results Booster vaccination with S-268019-b resulted in an enhancement of serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers and a broad range of viral neutralization. Single-cell immune profiling revealed persistent and mature antigen-specific memory B cells and T follicular helper cells, with increased B-cell receptor diversity. The expansion of B- and T-cell repertoires and presence of cross-reactive NAbs targeting conserved epitopes within the receptor-binding domain following a booster accounted for the broad-spectrum neutralizing activity. Conclusion These findings highlight the potential of S-268019-b to provide broad and robust protection against a range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, addressing a critical challenge in the ongoing fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).">

        <tr id="Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was repurposed to treat COVID-19 based on its in vitro antiviral effects. However, it was abandoned after multiple clinical trials reported a lack of efficacy. Immunomodulatory effects have been proposed but remain unclear, yet they may be relevant given IVM use for other infections. We assessed the IVM immunomodulatory effect in 24 participants from a clinical trial evaluating its potential to reduce COVID-19 transmission in mild cases within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM-treated patients showed non-significant lower viral loads, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We measured IgG, IgA, and IgM against five SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and 30 cytokines by Luminex, alongside whole blood RNA sequencing, pan-leukocyte immunophenotyping, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell analysis by flow cytometry from day 1 to day 28 post-treatment. All antibody responses increased from day 4, while 13 cytokines significantly decreased over time (adjusted p<0.05). IVM-treated patients had only significantly higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels at day 4 (adjusted p=0.041) and 7 (adjusted p=0.045) compared to placebo. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased over time, with significantly higher effector memory CD4+ T cells at day 7 compared to day 1 (p=0.027) and the only difference between groups was lower frequencies of spike-specific naïve CD4+ T cells at day 7 in IVM-treated participants (0.006% vs 0.036% p=0.02). Transcriptomic data showed downregulation of innate and antiviral blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) over time, with an increase in adaptive immune related BTMs. While no differential gene expression was detected, the IVM-treated had upregulated innate and downregulated T cell and cell cycle BTMs compared to placebo. Overall, our comprehensive longitudinal analysis of early immune responses in mild COVID-19 revealed no robust immunological effects of IVM, consistent with clinical trials results and suggesting a lack of efficacy of IVM in COVID-19 treatment. AUTHOR SUMMARY Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was tested in clinical trials as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due to its in vitro antiviral properties and hypothetical immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory effects of IVM in a clinical trial involving 24 mild COVID-19 patients who received IVM within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM group showed a trend towards lower viral loads post-treatment, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We comprehensively analyzed immune responses by measuring antibody levels, cytokine profiles, immune cell subsets and whole blood gene expression over 28 days. The IVM group only had increased levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid compared to the control group. IVM did not affect the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 T cells, despite a slight decrease in naive CD4+ T cells. Additionally, gene expression analysis showed a decrease in innate and antiviral responses and an increase of adaptive responses over time that were slightly stronger in the placebo compared to the IVM group. In conclusion, despite some differences in IVM treated participants, our detailed analyses do not support significant immunomodulatory effects that could benefit disease progression.">

        <tr id="Regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a key homeostatic regulator of immune cells, has been implicated in multiple diseases associated with aging and chronic inflammation including Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Interestingly, subjects with idiopathic PD display reduced levels of RGS10 in subsets of peripheral immune cells. Additionally, individuals with PD have been shown to have increased activated peripheral immune cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to age-matched healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether peripheral immune cells in the CSF of individuals with PD also exhibit decreased levels of RGS10. Utilizing the Michael J. Fox Foundation Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study we found that RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF of individuals with PD compared to healthy controls and prodromal individuals. As RGS10 levels are decreased in the CSF and circulating peripheral immune cells of individuals with PD, we hypothesized that RGS10 regulates peripheral immune cell responses to chronic systemic inflammation (CSI) prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. To test this, we induced CSI for 6 weeks in C57BL6/J mice and RGS10 KO mice to assess circulating and CNS-associated immune cell responses. We found that RGS10 deficiency synergizes with CSI to induce a bias for inflammatory and cytotoxic cell populations, a reduction in antigen presentation machinery in peripheral blood immune cells, as well as in and around the brain that is most notable in males. These results highlight RGS10 as an important regulator of the systemic immune response to CSI and implicate RGS10 as a potential contributor to the development of immune dysregulation in PD.

        <tr id="Background : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a public health challenge worldwide. The gastrointestinal tract has emerged as an important site of infection and has been implicated as a reservoir for long-term infection, particularly for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. However, whether vaccine-induced systemic antibodies can prevent intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Compared to Vero cells commonly used to assess SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, the intestinal epithelium has a functional interferon response and expresses higher levels of ACE2, enzymes, and antibody-binding Fc receptors that may impact SARS-CoV-2 immune elimination. Methods : We evaluated the potential of antibodies from both naturally infected and vaccinated human subjects to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium. Serum samples were collected from human volunteers who had undergone natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 (n=5) or who had received the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (n=13). Banked sera collected in 2016 served as negative controls (n=2). SARS-CoV-2 (WA01, Delta or Omicron) was pre-treated with sera and then used to infect iPSC-derived human intestinal organoids (HIO) or Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by plaque assay, PCR, or immunofluorescence (IF) after 48-96 h. Results: Both HIOs and Caco-2 cells supported robust infection with SARS-CoV-2. In HIOs, pretreatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a high titer post-vaccine serum completely blocked replication of WA01. Similarly, sera from both naturally infected donors collected in 2020 and sera from individuals who had received a BNT162b2 vaccine significantly inhibited replication of the WA01 strain in Caco-2 cells. In contrast, none of the sera significantly inhibited infection with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. For Omicron, only sera from individuals who had received an Omicron-based vaccine significantly inhibited infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the plaque assay. Across all virus types, sera from individuals who had received Omicron-based BNT162b2 boosters were the most effective at reducing infection in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that vaccine-induced antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are protective in the gut. Our study also supports previous reports indicating that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines need to be adapted to circulating virus strains to convey full protection from infection.">

        <tr id="Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak revealed the susceptibility of elderly patients to respiratory virus infections, showing cell senescence or subclinical persistent inflammatory profiles and favoring the development of severe pneumonia. Methods In our study, we evaluated the potential influence of lung aging on the efficiency of replication of influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as determining the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of the distal lung tissue. Results Using precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from donors of different ages, we found that pandemic H1N1 and avian H5N1 IAV replicated in the lung parenchyma with high efficacy. In contrast to these IAV strains, SARS-CoV-2 Early isolate and Delta variant of concern (VOC) replicated less efficiently in PCLS. Interestingly, both viruses showed reduced replication in PCLS from older compared to younger donors, suggesting that aged lung tissue represents a suboptimal environment for viral replication. Regardless of the age-dependent viral loads, PCLS responded to H5N1 IAV infection by an induction of IL-6 and IP10/CXCL10, both at the mRNA and protein levels, and to H1N1 IAV infection by induction of IP10/CXCL10 mRNA. Finally, while SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 IAV infection were not causing detectable cell death, H5N1 IAV infection led to more cytotoxicity and induced significant early interferon responses. Conclusions In summary, our findings suggest that aged lung tissue might not favor viral dissemination, pointing to a determinant role of dysregulated immune mechanisms in the development of severe disease.

        <tr id="Background Dengue encephalitis, a severe neurological complication of dengue virus infection, is increasingly recognized for its rising incidence and significant public health burden. Despite its growing prevalence, the underlying mechanisms and effective therapeutic strategies remain poorly understood. Methods Cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis was determined by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Viral load of dengue virus and the level of cytokines expression was detected by RT-qPCR. The target cells of dengue virus were verified by immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell was determined by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, adoptive transfer and CCK-8-based cell viability assay. Axonal and synaptic reduction induced by dengue virus infection was demonstrated by RT-qPCR, Western blot, transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence. Finally, motor and sensory functions of mice were detected by open field test and hot plate test, respectively. Results In this study, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing on brain tissues from a dengue-infected murine model to construct a comprehensive cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis. Our findings identify neurons, particularly inhibitory GABAergic subtypes, as the primary targets of dengue virus. Additionally, immune cell infiltration was observed, contributing to significant neurological damage. Comprehensive analyses of cell-cell communication, combined with CD8+ T cell depletion and transfer restoration experiments, have elucidated the critical role of CD8+ T cells in triggering encephalitis through their interaction with neurons. These cells infiltrate the brain from peripheral circulation, interact with neurons, and induce damage of synapse and axon, accompanied by neurological dysfunction. Conclusion We defined cellular atlas of dengue encephalitis in mouse model and identified the primary target neuron of dengue virus. In addition, we demonstrated the significant cytotoxic effect of CD8+ T cell, which leads to apoptosis of neuron and neurological dysfunction of mice. Our study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding dengue encephalitis through advanced sequencing technologies. The insights gained serve as a foundation for future investigations into its pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.

        <tr id="Neurotropic viruses are the most common cause of infectious encephalitis and highly target neurons for infection. Our understanding of the intrinsic capacity of neuronal innate immune responses to mediate protective antiviral responses remains incomplete. Here, we evaluated the role of intercellular crosstalk in mediating intrinsic neuronal immunity and its contribution to limiting viral infection. We found that in the absence of viral antagonism, neurons transcriptionally induce robust interferon signaling and can effectively signal to uninfected bystander neurons. Yet, in two-dimensional cultures, this dynamic response did not restrict viral spread. Interestingly, this differed in the context of viral infection in three-dimensional forebrain organoids with complex neuronal subtypes and cellular organization, where we observed protective capacity. We showed antiviral crosstalk between infected neurons and bystander neural progenitors is mediated by type I interferon signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we then uncovered regions containing bystander neural progenitors that expressed distinct antiviral genes, revealing critical underpinnings of protective antiviral responses among neuronal subtypes. These findings underscore the importance of interneuronal communication in protective antiviral immunity in the brain and implicate key contributions to protective antiviral signaling.

        <tr id="Common neurological symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction, depend on interactions between the peripheral and central nervous systems. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections. Highlights iPSC technology was employed to generate peripheral sensory neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), providing a valuable platform for studying the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 variant exerted both direct and indirect effects on peripheral sensory neurons. Virus exposure upregulated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in peripherin-positive neurons. Additionally, exposure to the virus or its S1 spike protein increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression and trafficking, leading to axonal degeneration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that BA.5 exposure enhanced cAMP signaling pathway, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels that led to the significantly damage on synapses and axon guidance. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine inhibited TRPV1 activation and mitigated axonal damage, offering neuroprotective effects for sensory neurons exposed to SARS-CoV-2.">

Peripheral blood responses among SARS-CoV-2-infected children and adolescents are dominated by interferon pathways, while upregulation of myeloid activation, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways is observed only in adults. Among SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, fever is associated with blunted URT immune responses and more pronounced systemic immune activation. These findings demonstrate that immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 differ across the lifespan, from distinct signatures in childhood and adolescence to age-associated alterations in adults.">

        <tr id="With the continuous emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, long-lasting and broadly reactive cellular and humoral immunity is critical for durable protection from COVID-19. We investigated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in relation to antibodies, infection outcome and disease severity and assessed its durability in a longitudinal cohort over a three-year time course. We identified pre-existing T cells reactive to the seasonal coronavirus (CoV) OC43 that cross-react with the conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike S813-829 peptide. These cross-reactive T cells increased in frequency following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination and correlated with enhanced spike-specific T cell responses and significantly reduced viral loads. Furthermore, our data revealed that CoV-cross-reactive T cells were maintained as part of the long-lasting memory response, contributing to increased T cell frequencies against omicron variants. These findings suggest a functional role of CoV-cross-reactive T cells that extends beyond the initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, contributing to enhanced immunity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can cause neurological symptoms, but the underlying neurotropic mechanisms are unclear. Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics. In summary, human astrocytes, but not neurons, contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, highlighting the potential benefits of ketamine treatment in coronavirus infections.">

        <tr id="In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion2 and systemic hyperinflammation3. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Long COVID represents a significant global health challenge with an unclear etiology. Alongside accumulating evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, a symptomatic overlap exists between long COVID and mitochondrial disorders. However, the genetic underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID have not been previously explored. We employed whole genome sequencing to analyze 13 patients with severe long COVID to identify genetic defects related to mitochondrial function. We performed extracellular bioenergetics flux analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and proteomics to evaluate cellular bioenergetics and compared the results to those of healthy controls. Our investigation identified 10 variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 83 variants of unknown significance affecting a wide range of mitochondria‐associated biological functions. Bioenergetics flux analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed an altered ATP production rate in four long COVID patients compared to healthy controls. This study presents initial evidence of a potential underlying genetic predisposition to mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID while demonstrating altered cellular energy capacity in a subset of these patients. These findings open avenues for further research into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and pathology in patients suffering from long COVID and may pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Epidemiological investigations consistently demonstrate an overrepresentation of the elderly in COVID-19 hospitalizations and fatalities, making the advanced age as a major predictor of disease severity. Despite this, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms explaining how old age represents a major risk factor remain elusive. To investigate this, we compared SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes in young adults (2 months) and geriatric (15–22 months) mice. Both groups of K18-ACE2 mice were intranasally infected with 500 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with analyses performed on days 3, 5, and 7 post-infection (DPI). Analyses included pulmonary cytokines, lung RNA-seq, viral loads, lipidomic profiles, and histological assessments, with a concurrent evaluation of the percentage of mice reaching humane endpoints. The findings unveiled notable differences, with aged mice exhibiting impaired viral clearance, reduced survival, and failure to recover weight loss due to infection. RNA-seq data suggested greater lung damage and reduced respiratory function in infected aged mice. Additionally, elderly-infected mice exhibited a deficient antiviral response characterized by reduced Th1-associated mediators (IFNγ, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9) and diminished number of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Furthermore, mass-spectrometry analysis of the lung lipidome indicated altered expression of several lipids with immunomodulatory and pro-resolution effects in aged mice such as Resolvin, HOTrEs, and NeuroP, but also DiHOMEs-related ARDS. These findings indicate that aging affects antiviral immunity, leading to prolonged infection, greater lung damage, and poorer clinical outcomes. This underscores the potential efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments for elderly subjects experiencing symptoms of severe COVID-19.

        <tr id="Viral replication in endothelial cells is a hallmark of many viral diseases in humans and other animals, underscoring the importance of understanding cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication and the associated consequences for vascular health. Pathogenic variants of infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV, Isavirus salaris) target endothelial cells of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), causing severe systemic disease and major losses during outbreaks in aquaculture. To better understand the endothelial response to ISAV, we used single nucleus RNA-sequencing at pre-clinical (12 days post infection, dpi) and clinical (16 dpi) stages of infection. Our approach enables an assessment of transcriptomic responses for different endothelial subpopulations at unprecedented resolution. ISAV RNA was predominantly detected in endothelial cells, which, along with mononuclear phagocytes, showed the highest number of differentially regulated genes at both time points. At 12 dpi, differentially expressed genes in endothelial cells were enriched for pathways related to NOD-like receptor signaling, antiviral responses, and regulation of programmed cell death. By 16 dpi, we observed a shift toward enrichment of pathways associated with cellular senescence, apelin signaling, and insulin signaling. We identified two distinct infection-related states at both time points: a virus-permissive state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, small GTPase signaling, and MAPK activity, and a bystander phenotype marked by activation of antiviral responses, immune signaling, and translational regulation. This study is the first to capture the individual cell type responses to ISAV infection, and to characterize the in vivo endothelial response to active viral replication at single-cell resolution in any species.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells are critical for immune protection against severe COVID-19 during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, the induction of antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies substantially among infected people, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie such immune heterogeneity is required for pandemic preparedness and risk stratification. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in relation to age, clinical status, and inflammation among patients infected primarily during the initial wave of the pandemic in France or Japan. We found that age-related contraction of the naive lymphocyte pool and systemic inflammation were associated with suboptimal SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and, even more evidently, CD8+ T cell immunity in patients with acute COVID-19. No such differences were observed for humoral immune responses targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, concentrations of which were significantly elevated among patients with severe disease, suppressed the de novo induction and memory recall of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, including those directed against SARS-CoV-2. These results potentially explain the vulnerability of older adults to infections that elicit a profound inflammatory response, exemplified by acute COVID-19.">

Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer-and region-specificity. In Parkinson’s disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The spike S1 subunit induces inflammatory cytokine production, but the immune cell subsets that respond to S1 stimulation and contribute to disease severity remain unclear. Methods We analyzed serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 (moderate: n = 7; severe: n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 38). Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement. The frequency of CD147hi cMono showed a stronger positive correlation with clinical severity markers in younger patients compared to older patients. Conclusions CD147hi cMono are the primary cellular source of S1-induced inflammatory cytokines and may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity and treatment response.

        <tr id="Human microglial heterogeneity is only beginning to be appreciated at the molecular level. Here, we present a large, single-cell atlas of expression signatures from 441,088 live microglia broadly sampled across a diverse set of brain regions and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases obtained from 161 donors sampled at autopsy or during a neurosurgical procedure. Using single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), we derived a 23-factor model for continuous gene expression signatures across microglia which capture specific biological processes (e.g., metabolism, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory signaling, disease-associated states). Using external datasets, we evaluated the aspects of microglial phenotypes that are encapsulated in various in vitro and in vivo microglia models and identified and replicated the role of two factors in human postmortem tissue of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Further, we derived a complex network of transcriptional regulators for all factors, including regulators of an AD-related factor enriched for the mouse disease-associated microglia 2 (DAM2) signature: ARID5B, CEBPA, MITF, and PPARG. We replicated the role of these four regulators in the AD-related factor and then designed a multiplexed MERFISH panel to assess our microglial factors using spatial transcriptomics. We find that, unlike cells with high expression of the interferon-response factor, cells with high expression of the AD DAM2-like factor are widely distributed in neocortical tissue. We thus propose a novel analytic framework that provides a taxonomic approach for microglia that is more biologically interpretable and use it to uncover new therapeutic targets for AD.">

To investigate the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, seven SIV+ rhesus macaques were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 in all macaques was mild. SARS-CoV-2 replication persisted in the upper, but not the lower respiratory tract for 14 days post-infection. Animals showed impaired generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cells. Animals also displayed transient changes in microbial communities in the upper airway and gastrointestinal tract. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 evolution was observed in the upper respiratory tract. This study demonstrates that SIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in rhesus macaques recapitulates aspects of COVID-19 in PLWH. We show that SIV impairs anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, potentially leading to prolonged viral shedding, altered pathogenesis, and viral evolution. This highlights the importance of HIV status in COVID-19 and supports the use of this model for HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different cell-type specific reprogramming as a result of B cell depletion treatment in MS.">

        <tr id="Long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection affect millions of people and strain public health systems. The underlying pathomechanisms remain unclear, necessitating further research in appropriate animal models. This study aimed to characterize the trajectory of lung regeneration over 112 days in the male hamster model by combining morphological, transcriptomic and functional readouts. We demonstrate that in the acute phase, SARS-CoV-2 Delta-infected, male, aged hamsters show a severe impairment of lung function at rest. In the chronic phase, similar impairments persisted up to 7 weeks post-infection but were only evident after exercise on a rodent treadmill. The male hamster model recapitulates chronic pulmonary fibrotic changes observed in many patients with respiratory long COVID, but lacks extra-pulmonary long-term lesions. We show that sub-pleural and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis as well as alveolar bronchiolization persist until 112 dpi. Interestingly, CK8+ alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cells are becoming less prominent in the alveolar proliferation areas from 28 dpi on. Instead, CK14+ airway basal cells and SCGB1A1+ club cells, expressing cell proliferation markers, mainly populate alveolar bronchiolization areas at later time-points. We postulate that pulmonary fibrosis and SCGB1A1+ club cell-rich areas of alveolar bronchiolization represent potential risk factors for other diseases in long-COVID survivors.">

        <tr id="The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly heterogeneous, with interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression playing a dual role in antiviral defense and immune dysregulation. To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Four influenza pandemics have occurred during the past 100 years, and new variants of influenza viruses will continue to emerge. The nasal mucosa acts as the primary site of exposure to influenza A virus (IAV) infection, but viral recognition and host immune responses in the nasal mucosa are still poorly understood. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the utility of non-invasive nasopharyngeal swabs for longitudinal monitoring of mucosal immune responses in pigs experimentally challenged with two swine-adapted and one human-adapted IAV. By tracking antiviral immune responses from disease onset to recovery, we sought to assess the feasibility of this method for capturing dynamic changes in viral load and host responses across different IAV strains. Methods Forty-two IAV-negative pigs were divided into four groups and housed separately for infection studies. Viral and host RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs was analyzed using microfluidic qPCR, while statistical analysis was performed with a Bayesian approach in R. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining was used to assess MUC5AC expression in the nasal mucosa of infected pigs. Results RNA was successfully isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs, enabling gene expression analysis to monitor innate immune responses to IAV infection. A classical innate antiviral immune response was demonstrated after the three virus infections including expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), transcription factors, interferons (IFNs), interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), cytokines, and chemokines. The kinetics and magnitude of immune responses varied between infections, with notable downregulation of mucins following infection with the Danish swine-adapted isolate. Further, the Danish isolate induced a fast but transient IFN-mediated response concurrent with high expression of cytokines and chemokines, while the other swine-adapted Mexican isolate induced a prolonged immune response of ISGs, cytokines, and chemokines. Conclusion This study highlights the significance of highly translational nasopharyngeal swabs as a non-invasive method for assessing mucosal antiviral immune responses. Utilizing microfluidic mRNA analysis, we gained valuable insights into antiviral mucosal responses across 216 swab samples collected from viral inoculation through recovery in three distinct influenza virus infections.">

        <tr id="Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) constitute a significant ongoing public health threat, as the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Cardiovascular symptomatology is emerging as an important manifestation of arboviral infection. We have recently studied the cardiac tropism implicated in cardiac infection in mice for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and we therefore sought to evaluate the cardiac tropism of other emerging alphaviruses and arboviruses. Using human primary cardiac cells, we found that arboviruses from diverse viral families were able to replicate within these cells. Interestingly, we noted that while the closely related alphavirus Mayaro virus (MAYV) could replicate to high titers in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, pulmonary, and brain endothelial cells, the Indian Ocean Lineage of CHIKV (CHIKV-IOL) was restricted in all endothelial cells tested. Upon further investigation, we discovered that this restriction occurs at both entry and egress stages. Additionally, we observed that compared to CHIKV, MAYV may antagonize or evade the innate immune response more efficiently in human cardiac endothelial cells to increase infection. Overall, this study explores the tropism of arboviruses in human primary cardiac cells and characterizes the strain-specific restriction of CHIKV-IOL in human endothelial cells. Further work is needed to understand how the differential restriction of alphaviruses in human endothelial cells impacts pathogenesis in a living model, as well as the specific host factors responsible.">

        <tr id="Introduction Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing immune responses against pathogens. The fluctuation of Treg proportions in COVID-19 remains a topic of debate, and the mechanisms triggering Treg activation in COVID-19 are still unclear. Understanding these issues is essential for better managing immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Methods We collected a cohort of COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and stage to explore the transcriptomic and functional traits of Tregs in these individuals. Using transcriptomic analysis, we evaluated the proportion and functionality of different Treg subsets, specifically HLA_DR+ Tregs, across different stages of COVID-19 patients. Results Our analysis revealed that the proportion of CCR7 + Tregs decreased as the disease advanced, while the cell proportion of HLA_DR+ regs escalated with the severity of the disease. Moreover, the transcription actor CARHSP1 exhibited apositive correlation with the proportion of HLA_DR+ Tregs. Notably, the heightened suppressive function of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients, with interactions between PF4 and CXCR3, contributed to the homeostasis of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that Tregs in COVID-19 patients exhibited weakened TCR clonotype expansion, and the suppression of HLA_DR+ Tregs with expanded TCR clonotypes in severe COVID-19 cases did not show a significant increase compared to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 groups. The findings indicate that Tregs may be activated through the bystander effect, as evidenced by the analysis of TCR clonotype characteristics. Discussion Our research delineates the diversity of dynamic alterations in Tregs and sheds light on potential mechanisms underlying Treg activation, providing a theoretical foundation and offering treatment strategies for managing COVID-19 patients.">

The differences between animal models and humans contribute to inefficiencies in drug development, highlighting the need for more relevant and predictive, non-animal models.

This model exhibited a functional barrier over a 30-day period, evidenced by high transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These findings were further validated by tight junctions’ confocal microscopy and low permeability to Lucifer yellow, confirming AlveolAir™ as robust platform for drug transport assays. Additionally, successful infections with H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses were achieved, and antiviral treatments with Baloxavir and Remdesivir, respectively, effectively reduced viral replication. Interestingly, both viruses infected only the epithelial layer without replicating in endothelial cells.

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) levels have been noted to be considerably increased in patients with sepsis, where they are linked to disease severity and can independently predict short- and long-term mortality risk. Serum levels of GDF15 have also been negatively associated with gray matter volume and predict cognitive impairment in older individuals. However, the impact of GDF15 on sepsis-induced cognitive and memory impairments, as well as the mechanisms behind these effects, are poorly understood. Methods To examine the role of GDF15 in SAE, a sepsis model was created in adult C57BL/6J mice using intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GDF15 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were measured by ELISA. The anti-GDF15 monoclonal antibody ponsegromab was injected intracerebroventricularly before modeling, and cognitive and memory functions of the septic mice were assessed using fear-conditioning and novel object recognition tests. Microglial activation and phagocytosis were evaluated using immunofluorescence and Golgi staining. Additionally, an in vitro investigation of LPS-stimulated microglia was conducted to evaluate the impacts of GDF15 on inflammatory cytokine productions and microglial phagocytic activity. Mechanisms were explored using RNA sequencing, qPCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence assays. Results In the cerebrospinal fluid of septic mice, levels of GDF15 were notably elevated after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Lateral ventricular injection of the anti-GDF15 antibody alleviated both cognitive and memory impairment in the septic mice, together with microglial activation and phagocytosis in the hippocampus, thereby protecting against synaptic loss. Conclusion The levels of GDF15 were elevated in the brains of septic mice. Targeting GDF15 with an anti-GDF15 antibody was found to improve sepsis-induced cognitive and memory impairment by reducing the microglial inflammatory response and phagocytosis. These results indicate that GDF15 could serve as an important therapeutic target for treating SAE.

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="This study investigates the role of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a metabolite produced by cholesterol hydroxylase encoded by the Ch25h gene, in modulating microglial function and its potential implications in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. We demonstrated that 25HC impairs microglial surveillance, reduces phagocytic capacity, and increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo two-photon microscopy revealed that 25HC administration diminishes microglial response to brain lesions, while flow cytometry confirmed reduced phagocytosis in both in vivo and in vitro models. Additionally, amyloid-beta (Aβ) was shown to upregulate Ch25h expression and elevate 25HC levels in microglia, exacerbating these functional impairments. Mechanistically, 25HC was found to enhance cholesterol esterification, disrupt cell membrane dynamics, and further reduce microglial mobility and phagocytosis. Treatment with Avasimibe, a cholesterol esterification inhibitor, restored membrane dynamics and microglial function, leading to attenuated AD pathology in a 5XFAD mouse model. These findings suggest that 25HC-induced changes in microglial function contribute to AD progression, and targeting cholesterol metabolism could offer therapeutic potential.

        <tr id="The understanding of how the host immune response differs in T-cell phenotype and memory formation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) remains limited. LTRs who recovered from COVID-19 infection without prior vaccination represent a unique population for studying immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Six LTRs with positive neutralizing antibodies (nAb+) and six LTRs with negative nAb (nAb-) were included at 6 months following COVID-19 infection. It was found that nAb+ LTRs had higher anti-RBD IgG titers and greater neutralizing percent inhibition compared to nAb- LTRs. Fifteen T-cell subsets were identified in COVID-19 convalescent LTRs, and it was shown that only terminal effector CD8+ - 3 decreased in the nAb+ group, while elevated IL-10 expression levels were found in the nAb- group. After stimulation with the SARS-CoV-2 XBB spike peptide pool in vitro, it was observed that the nAb+ group exhibited an increase in effector memory CD4+ cells with lower PD-1 expression, a reduction in effector memory CD4+ - 2 cells, and terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells, while the nAb- group showed high expression of CTLA-4 and IL-10 in terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells. Four SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell subsets were identified, with high expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in terminal effector CD8+ - 1 and terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in both groups. Perforin was mainly detected in terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in nAb+ LTRs. In addition to these proportional differences, stem cell memory CD4+ cells with higher IL-17A expression and stem cell memory CD8+ cells with higher CTLA-4 expression were also found in nAb- LTRs. These findings suggest that LTRs who developed nAb+ following SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit stronger T-cell responses, with more robust immune activation and memory recall, compared to nAb- LTRs. This study underscores the importance of understanding T-cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 recovery for guiding vaccination strategies and managing immunity in LTRs.">

        <tr id="Abstract COVID-19 vaccines are crucial in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and severe health outcomes. Despite widespread administration, their long-term systemic effects on human metabolism remain inadequately understood. This longitudinal study aims to evaluate IgG responses, 34 cytokines, 112 lipoproteins, and 21 low-molecular-weight metabolites in 33 individuals receiving two to four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Changes in metabolic profiles for the first 16 days post each dose of vaccine, and up to 480 days post-initial dose, were compared to baseline (before vaccination). Additionally, metabolic profiles of vaccinated participants were compared to a reference cohort of unvaccinated individuals without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (controls) and SARS-CoV-2 cases. Positive IgG responses were observed in 78.8% (N = 26) of participants after the first dose, reaching 100% with subsequent doses. The most common side effects were localized pain at the injection site and “flu-like” symptoms, reported by > 50% of participants. Systemic side effects, e.g., sore lymph nodes, fatigue, and brain fog, were reported but showed no significant correlations to IgG responses. Transient temporal changes were observed for cytokine IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third vaccine dose. Compared to the reference cohort, 497 vaccinated samples (95.0%) had profiles similar to the controls, while the remaining 26 samples with prior infection exposures were similar to mild cases of SARS-CooV-2 infection. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination did not induce lasting changes in inflammatory and metabolic responses, nor did it induce changes similar to mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This supports the metabolic safety of the vaccine and contributes to increased vaccine confidence. Key messages Minimal changes in inflammatory/metabolic markers up to 480 days post-vaccination. Transient increase in IP10 (CXCL10) and glutamic acid around the third dose. Post-vaccination IgG response did not alter metabolic profiles like SARS-CoV-2 cases. Our findings provide insights into the safety of repeated COVID-19 vaccinations.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly enhanced our understanding of CD8+ T cell immunity and their role in natural infection and vaccine-induced protection. Rapid and early SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses have been associated with efficient viral clearance and mild disease. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses can compensate for waning, morbidity-related, and iatrogenic reduction of humoral immunity. After infection or vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are formed, which mount an efficient recall response in the event of breakthrough infection and help to protect from severe disease. Due to their breadth and ability to target mainly highly conserved epitopes, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are also able to cross-recognize epitopes of viral variants, thus maintaining immunity even after the emergence of viral evolution. In some cases, however, CD8+ T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. In particular, delayed and uncontrolled, e.g., nonspecific and hyperactivated, cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses have been linked to poor COVID-19 outcomes. In this minireview, we summarize the tremendous knowledge about CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination that has been gained over the past 5 years, while also highlighting the critical knowledge gaps that remain.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation in alveolar epithelial cells remains very limited. The contributions of intracellular insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2) to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are also unclear. In this study, we have uncovered a critical role for IGFBP2, specifically in alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2), in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we show that IGFBP2 mRNA expression is significantly downregulated in primary AEC2 cells isolated from fibrotic lung regions from patients with COVID-19-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) alone or IPF with a history of COVID-19. Using multicolor immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that IGFBP2 and its selective ligands IGF1 and IGF2 were significantly reduced in AEC2 cells from patients with COVID-ARDS, IPF alone, or IPF with COVID history than in those from age-matched donor controls. Further, we demonstrated that lentiviral expression of Igfbp2 significantly reduced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines—Tnf-α, Il1β, Il6, Stat3, Stat6 and chemokine receptors—Ccr2 and Ccr5—in mouse lung epithelial cells challenged with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein injury (S2; 500 ng/mL). Finally, we demonstrated higher levels of cytokines—TNF-α; IL-6 and chemokine receptor—CCR5 in AEC2 cells from COVID-ARDS patients compared to the IPF alone and the IPF with COVID history patients. Altogether, these data suggest that anti-inflammatory properties of IGFBP2 in AEC2 cells and its localized delivery may serve as potential therapeutic strategy for patients with COVID-19.

        <tr id="Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have emerged. Although the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the lungs, it can also affect the brain and induce neurological symptoms. However, the specific effects of different variants on the brain remain unclear. In this study, a whole-transcriptome analysis was conducted using the brain tissues of K18-hACE2 mice infected with the ancestral B.1 (Wuhan) variant and with major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.529 (Omicron). After sequencing, differential gene expression, gene ontology (GO) and genome pathway enrichment analyses were performed. An Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) was used to identify the abundance of different cell populations. Additionally, RT-qPCR was used to validate the RNA-seq data. The viral load and hierarchical clustering analyses divided the samples into two different clusters with notable differences in gene expression at day 6 post-infection for all variants compared to the control group. GO and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses revealed similar patterns of pathway enrichment for different variants. ImmuCellAI revealed the changes in immune cell populations, including the decrease in CD4+ T and B cell proportions and the increase in CD8+ T and dendritic cell proportions. A co-expression network analysis revealed that some genes, such as STAT1, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), were dysregulated in all variants. A RT-qPCR analysis for IL-6, CXCL10 and IRF7 further validated the RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, this study provides, for the first time, an extensive transcriptome analysis of a K18-hACE2 mouse brain after infection with major SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Objective Both B-cell- and T-cell-mediated immunity are crucial for the effective clearance of viral infection, but little is known about the dynamic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in people living with HIV (PLWH) after a full course of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Methods In this study, fifty people living with HIV (PLWH) and thirty healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled to assess B-cell and T-cell responses at the day before the vaccination (T0), two weeks after the first dose (T1), two months after the first dose (T2), the day of the third dose (T3), one month after the third dose (T4), three months after the third dose (T5) and 12 months (T6) after the third dose. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses were induced in people living with HIV (PLWH), and these responses lasted at least one year after the third vaccine dose. However, the peak frequencies of Spike-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in PLWH were lower than those in HIV-negative controls. In addition, the expansion of activated B cells, memory B cells and plasma cells after primary vaccination was observed, but the percentages of these cells were decreased at T6 and were comparable to those at T0. Additionally, the percentages of activated T cells, exhausted T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with enhanced functional activity were increased following the administration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In addition, PLWH had lower percentages of plasma cells, RBD-specific B cells, circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells and CD38+ cTfh cells, and the percentages of the latter two types of cells were positively correlated with the titer of neutralizing antibodies, indicating these differences may account for the weaker immune responses induced in PLWH. Conclusion These data suggest that specific B-cell and T-cell responses could be sustained for at least one year after receiving the third vaccination. Our findings emphasize that the weak SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses induced in PLWH have implications for clinical decision-making and public health policy for PLWH with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Background Pregnant women are considered a high-risk population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as the virus can infect the placenta and embryos. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been widely reported to cause retinal pathological changes and to infect the embryonic retina. The infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2 is primarily mediated through spike (S) protein, which also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, it remains poorly understood how the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 affects retinal development, and the underlying mechanism has not yet been clarified. Methods We used human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal organoids (hEROs) as a model to study the effect of S protein exposure at different stages of retinal development. hEROs were treated with 2 μg/mL of S protein on days 90 and 280. Immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the influence of S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages. Results The results showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the receptors facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, were expressed in hEROs. Exposure to the S protein induced an inflammatory response in both the early and late stages of retinal development in the hEROs. Additionally, RNA sequencing indicated that early exposure of the S protein to hEROs affected nuclear components and lipid metabolism, while late-stages exposure resulted in changes to cell membrane components and the extracellular matrix. Conclusion This work highlights the differential effects of SARS-CoV-2 S protein exposure on retinal development at both early and late stages, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced developmental impairments in the human retina.

        <tr id="Introduction Porcine Circovirus (PCV2) infection is prevalent in pig farming and causes significant economic losses. In recent years, the PCV2d subtype has become the most prevalent genotype worldwide, exhibiting higher virulence, leading to more severe viremia and organ damage. Therefore, studying the biological characteristics of the PCV2d subtype is of great significance. Methods We established a PCV2d infection model using BALB/c mice and employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically analyze the transcriptome of 10 cell types in the lung tissues of infected mice. We developed a comprehensive marker gene catalog for these cell types. Results Compared to uninfected mice, PCV2d infection induced extensive viral replication and immunosuppressive responses in most cell types. Monocyte macrophages with high levels of viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various cell population interactions occurring through CD40-CD40L and CXCL14-CXCR4 were identified. These cells predominantly mediate antigen presentation and processing pathways in vivo, contributing to PCV2d-driven inflammatory lung injury. Discussion Our data uncovered a complex unique immune response scenario in the lung tissue of mice after PCV2d infection, deciphering the potential mechanisms underlying PCV2d-driven inflammatory responses in mice. Furthermore, this study provides a rich database for the molecular basis of different cell types' responses to PCV2d infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has highlighted the critical importance of understanding protective long-lasting immune responses. This study investigates the epitope specificity, T cell receptor (TCR) usage, and phenotypic changes in SARS-CoV-2-specfic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells over time in convalescent individuals with COVID-19. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 28 unvaccinated individuals with primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (6 identified as the D614G variant, clade 20C) and analyzed up to 12 months post-symptom onset. Antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) using specific dextramer and antibody reagents. TCR clonotypes and activation markers were characterized to explore T cell dynamics. Results SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited waning frequencies long-term, transitioning from memory-like to a naïve-like state. scRNAseq revealed specificity against both spike and non-spike antigens with increased CD95 and CD127 expression over time, indicating that naïve-like T cells may represent stem cell memory T cells, which are multipotent and self-renewing, likely important for long-lived immunity. TCR clonal expansion was observed mainly in memory T cells, with overlapping TCR beta chain (TRB)-complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences between participants, suggesting shared public TCR epitope-specific repertoires against SARS-CoV-2. Further, unique spike-specific CD4+ T cells with high CD95 and CD127 expression were identified, which may play a crucial role in long-term protection. Discussion This study highlights epitope-specificity heterogeneity, with some immunodominant responses, and suggests a potential role for long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. Shared TCR repertoires offers insights into cross-reactive and protective T cell clones, providing valuable information for optimizing vaccine strategies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings underscore the critical role of cellular immunity in long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 and emphasizes the importance of understanding T cell dynamics.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely infectious respiratory virus and a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. MeV infection of the respiratory epithelium induces shedding of multinucleate epithelial cells from the apical surface of the epithelium without compromising epithelial barrier integrity. To study the mechanisms driving the apical extrusion of MeV-infected respiratory epithelial cells, we used primary differentiated tracheal epithelial cell cultures (rhTECs) and respiratory samples from rhesus macaques infected with wild-type MeV (WT MeV) or live-attenuated MeV (LAMV). We show that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, rather than cell death or inflammasome activation, plays a key role in WT MeV and LAMV-induced cell shedding. Inhibiting S1P signaling resulted in delayed shedding of clusters of infected cells and higher viral titers within the epithelium, suggesting that cell extrusion impacts viral dynamics within the respiratory tract. We also found that shedding of individual infected cells began early after apical infection, prior to the formation of infected cell clusters within the epithelium. These findings offer new insights into MeV biology and pathogenesis within the respiratory tract. IMPORTANCE Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, measles virus (MeV) still has a significant global impact, and in 2022 alone led to over 136,000 deaths. MeV is one of the most contagious known viruses and spreads via the respiratory route. When respiratory epithelial cells are infected, they are shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract, but this process is poorly understood. Here, we use primary differentiated respiratory epithelial cells from rhesus macaques to show that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, and not cell death or inflammasome activation, plays a role in cell shedding during both wild-type and live-attenuated MeV infection. Through this mechanism, MeV-infected cells are extruded without disrupting the integrity of the respiratory epithelium. Inhibiting S1P signaling resulted in delayed shedding of infected cells and higher viral titers in the epithelium. These findings indicate that host cellular responses play an important role in MeV infectivity.">

        <tr id="Background Our previous studies demonstrated that activated T cells accumulate in perihematomal regions following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and exacerbate hemorrhagic brain injury. In the present study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying brain-infiltrating T cell activation and the associated pathophysiological effects in neurological outcomes following ICH. Methods We employed standardized collagenase injection-induced and autologous blood injection models of ICH in male C57BL/6J mice. T cell receptor (TCR) activation, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine production were quantified through immunostaining, flow cytometry, and cytokine arrays at 1- and 3-days post-ICH. Brain edema volume was measured at 3 days post-ICH and neurobehavioral assessments were conducted up to 14 days post-ICH. Pharmacological inhibition of TCR activation was achieved using the TCR-specific inhibitor AX-024, administered intraperitoneally at a dosage of 10 mg/kg 1-hour post-ICH. Results Flow cytometry and immunostaining detected TCR activation of brain-infiltrating T cells. Specific TCR activation inhibitor AX-024 administration markedly reduced TCR activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain at 1- and 3-days post-ICH. Moreover, AX-024 administration led to a significant reduction in the infiltration of other leukocyte populations, and significantly reduced brain edema while improved long-term sensorimotor and cognitive outcomes up to 14 days post-ICH. Discussion Our findings underscore the critical role of TCR activation in the mobilization and activation of brain-infiltrating T cells post-ICH. Inhibition of TCR activation via AX-024 administration might be developed as a promising therapeutic strategy to improve neurological outcomes following ICH. However, further research is necessary to thoroughly explore the complex pathophysiological processes involved.">

        <tr id="Background HIV-1-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-1-NCI) is marked by ongoing and chronic neuroinflammation with loss and decline in neuronal function even when antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) successfully suppresses viral replication. Microglia, the primary reservoirs of HIV-1 in the central nervous system (CNS), play a significant role in maintaining this neuroinflammatory state. However, understanding how chronic neuroinflammation is generated and sustained by HIV-1, or impacted by ART, is difficult due to limited access to human CNS tissue. Methods We generated an in vitro model of admixed hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) derived microglia embedded into embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived Brain Organoids (BO). Microglia were infected with HIV-1 prior to co-culture. Infected microglia were co-cultured with brain organoids BOs to infiltrate the BOs and establish a model for HIV-1 infection, “HIV-1 M-BO”. HIV-1 M-BOs were treated with ART for variable directions. HIV-1 infection was monitored with p24 ELISA and by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Inflammation was measured by cytokine or p-NF-kB levels using multiplex ELISA, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results HIV-1 infected microglia could be co-cultured with BOs to create a model for “brain” HIV-1 infection. Although HIV-1 infected microglia were the initial source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells also had increased p-NF-kB levels, along with elevated CCL2 levels in the supernatant of HIV-1 M-BOs compared to Uninfected M-BOs. ART suppressed the virus to levels below the limit of detection but did not decrease neuroinflammation. Conclusions These findings indicate that HIV-1 infected microglia are pro-inflammatory. Although ART significantly suppressed HIV-1 levels, neuronal inflammation persisted in ART-treated HIV-1 M-BOs. Together, these findings indicate that HIV-1 infection of microglia infiltrated into BOs provides a robust in vitro model to understand the impact of HIV-1 and ART on neuroinflammation.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in both plasma and EVs. A deep-immunophenotyping of monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) was performed, along with immunostainings of SARS-CoV-2 in the colon.Higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilaments were found in EVs but not in plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs9 expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon.COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC.

        <tr id="Abstract Chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV) are mosquito-borne viruses that cause severe epidemics, often in remote regions. A limitation to our understanding of these pathogens is the difficulty of performing assays of the cellular immune response. To fill this gap, we developed a novel miniaturized automated system capable of processing 250 μl of whole blood for high-throughput cellular analysis. In a field study with a pediatric cohort in Msambweni, Kenya, known for previous exposure to CHIKV and/or DENV, we processed 133 whole blood samples using our system under three conditions: no stimulation, and stimulation with CHIKV or DENV peptide pools. These samples underwent CyTOF or flow cytometry analysis to evaluate virus-specific memory T cell responses and phenotypes. CyTOF analysis of 81 participant samples revealed significant cytokine responses to CHIKV and DENV, particularly IFNγ (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and TNF-α (P < 0.0001) by γδ T cells. Additionally, a significant TNF-α response was observed in the CD8+ TEMRA memory subset to DENV, albeit to a lesser degree than in γδ T cells. To confirm our CyTOF findings, we employed flow cytometry on the remaining 40 samples using a targeted panel, validating significant TNF-α (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01) and IFN-γ (P < 0.05) responses by γδ T cells to CHIKV and DENV, respectively. Our study demonstrates that our innovative automated system enables detailed assessment of immune function, particularly beneficial in pediatric populations and resource-limited settings with limited sample volumes. This approach holds promise for advancing our understanding of cellular immune responses to various viral and infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, causes severe disease in older adults, and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in the United States for children during their first year of life [1]. Despite its prevalence worldwide, RSV-specific treatments remain unavailable for most infected patients. Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells, and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV infected and bystander activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing. Importance Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly. Despite its substantial global health burden, RSV-targeted treatments remain unavailable for the majority of individuals. While vaccine development is underway, a detailed understanding of the host response to RSV infection and identification of required human host factors for RSV may provide insight into combatting this pathogen. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and functional genomics to understand the host response in both RSV infected and bystander cells, identify what host factors mediate infection, and contextualize these findings relative to dozens of previously reported screens across 17 additional viruses.">

        <tr id="Background Variant-adapted vaccines are recommended in vulnerable populations to address the waning immunity and the emergence of immune-escaping SARS-CoV-2 variants, yet data about immune responses to such vaccines in people living with HIV (PLWH) are limited. We therefore aimed to assess long-term immune responses to an original–BA.4/5 mRNA booster in this population. Methods In this prospective longitudinal study, PLWH receiving either an original–BA.4/5 bivalent booster or an original monovalent booster and HIV-negative healthcare workers (HCWs) receiving a bivalent booster were enrolled and sampled before (T0), 1 month (T1), and 4–9 months (T2) after the vaccine administration. SARS-CoV-2–specific T and B cells, RBD-binding antibodies, and RBD-blocking antibodies against both wild type (WT) and omicron BA.4/5 virus were determined. Results The bivalent booster is able to transiently increase both humoral and polyfunctional T cell responses in PLWH, with humoral responses comparable to those observed in HCWs. While T cell responses are cross-reactive against viral variants and stable over time, humoral immunity is imprinted to the ancestral virus and wanes quickly. Furthermore, whilst previous SARS-CoV-2 infection does not affect the trajectory of vaccine-elicited immune responses, markers of HIV-related T cell dysfunction are associated with lower antibody peak responses and higher antibody waning. Lastly, the bivalent booster was superior to the monovalent one in inducing BA.4/5-reactive RBD-blocking antibodies. Conclusions The original–BA.4/5 bivalent booster is highly immunogenic in PLWH and superior to the monovalent one in inducing humoral responses against the BA.4/5 virus, although HIV-related T cell dysfunction markers are associated with blunted and less durable antibody immunity.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 is rare in children suggesting differences in immune response between children and adults. Limited information is available on how cellular immunity is modulated by COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection, and whether it is differentially modulated in children compared to adults. Here, we aimed to compare COVID-19 vaccine-induced functional T cell response between adults and children with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adults (18–45 years; n = 45) and children (5–10 years; n = 51;), who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or remained unvaccinated, and previously infected or not with SARS-CoV-2 were selected from two cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies conducted in Bangladesh. Plasma nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay; IFN-γ, perforin and granzyme B secreting T cells were assessed using ELISpot assay. Vaccination in adults without previous infection, induced higher frequencies of IFN-γ and granzyme B secreting T lymphocytes compared to unvaccinated adults, while it increased only IFN-γ expression in vaccinated children. Previous infection increased IFN-γ response in unvaccinated adults only. Unvaccinated children showed higher granzyme B expression compared to adults irrespective of infection status. In vaccinated individuals, prior infection induced perforin expression in both adults and children. Children showed slightly different functional T cell response than adults in response to COVID-19 vaccination and infection. mRNA vaccination provided higher IFN-γ response in both adults and children, but induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in adults only. Future studies may evaluate the impact of other types of COVID-19 vaccines on functional T cell immunity in children to confirm the findings.

        <tr id="Background The mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after non-severe COVID-19 remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate transcriptomic changes in peripheral blood cells of patients with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) and assess if distinct clinical subtypes with specific gene signatures could be identified. Methods The cohort included 111 PCC patients from the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant era, with 57 recovered (Recov) and 54 having prolonged symptoms indicative of PCC. The results were compared to 63 healthy controls (Ctrl) without known SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data included patient assessments, laboratory results, comorbidities, and questionnaires on quality of life and functioning. Transcriptomic analysis and cellular deconvolution methods were used on total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results PCC patients had more comorbidities (mean 1.3) and more frequently (59%) at least one comorbidity than recovered patients (31%) and controls (24%). Overall, past COVID-19 illness or current PCC symptoms caused minimal changes in the blood cell transcriptome, with only 3–6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified across comparisons. However, a subset of male PCC patients exhibited an increased fraction of deconvoluted erythroblasts and significant genome-wide gene expression changes, with 399 DEGs compared to recovered and control males. These genes were enriched in pathways related to heme metabolism and gas exchange in erythrocytes. Conclusions Persistent symptoms in PCC are multifactorial and not directly linked to peripheral blood cell gene expression changes. However, a subgroup of male PCC patients shows distinct erythrocyte responses that may contribute to long-term symptoms.">

        <tr id="The primary function of microglia is to maintain brain homeostasis. However, in several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, the pathophysiological hallmarks that drive disease progression involve neurotoxicity and alterations in neuroinflammation. In this study, we exposed murine neonatal primary microglial cultures to external signals that mimic the in vivo stimuli caused by pathogens, injury, or toxic agents. In the presence of benzoyl ATP (bzATP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we observed a coordinated increase in the expression of interleukins and chemokines. We focused on the dynamics of the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) that are statistically significant (DEMs) and tracked their post-activation dynamics. Monitoring miRNAs 3 and 8 hours (h) post-activation revealed robust changes in 33 and 57 DEMs, most of which were upregulated. The DEMs exhibiting the strongest temporal regulation included miR-155, miR-132, miR-3473e, miR-222, and miR-146b. Additionally, a strong downregulation of miR-3963 was attributed to the exposure to bzATP. Through their regulation of TNFα and NFκB signaling pathways, the identified DEMs reflect the cellular response to inflammatory signals. We incubated the activated cells with ladostigil, a neuroprotective compound that has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and cognitive decline. While there was no significant effect 3 h post-activation, at 8 h, a few miRNAs implicated in inflammation suppression such as miR-27a, miR-27b, and miR-23b were upregulated in a ladostigil-dependent manner. We conclude that the miRNA expression profile provides a sensitive indicator of the regulatory mechanisms underlying inflammation-related responses in microglia. We propose that primary microglia subjected to controlled activation paradigms can serve as a robust model for inflammatory states in the brain to monitor the aging brain along the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome predominantly affecting children, with a propensity to induce coronary artery lesions. Aberrant immune activation and cytokines cascade reactions are involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in immune cell communication during the course of KD and to identify potential biomarkers. Methods The study enrolled seven pediatric patients diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease (KD) between December 2019 and December 2021. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was utilized to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Bioinformatics methods including quality control, dimensionality reduction, cell annotation, differential expression analysis, cell communication analysis, and co-expression network analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. Results This study utilized single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the dynamics of immune cell communication during the course of KD, revealing a significant increase in the number of CD14+ monocytes in the early stages of vasculitis, which play a central role in cell-cell communication. SELPLG was identified as a particularly crucial gene in the signal transduction among immune cells. The study also observed various cellular communication patterns of vasculitis at different time points and identified co-expression modules related to ribosomal function, cell proliferation, and immune responses in CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD16+ monocytes. Notably, the expression of the ITK gene in CD14+ monocytes stood out. Furthermore, MHC-I genes were the most active molecules involved in signal transduction, and the expression of CD40 genes increased with the prolongation of vasculitis duration. Conclusion CD14+ monocytes play a pivotal role in cellular communication during the activation process of KD vasculitis, with SELPLG and ITK as important communication signal genes. These findings provide a novel perspective for the discovery of biomarkers, prediction of disease progression, and the development of targeted treatment strategies for KD.

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.">

        <tr id="Adult stem cell therapy holds great promise for treating decompensated liver cirrhosis on the basis of animal studies, despite uncertainty about its clinical therapeutic efficacy and unclear underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the role of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), a profibrotic and proinflammatory matricellular protein, in inflammation-related heterogeneity in stem cell therapy. Our results showed that a high level of circulating FSTL1 is significantly correlated with therapeutic response in patients with cirrhosis. FSTL1 facilitated MSC-mediated early recruitment of Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophages within 24 h postinfusion, which was essential for the empowerment of MSCs and subsequent Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage remodelling at 48 h postinfusion. Fstl1 deficiency abrogated early macrophage recruitment and effective Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage accumulation, resulting in the poor antifibrotic effect of MSCs in mice. Whereas, recombinant FSTL1 protein restored the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in CCl4-injured Fstl1+/− mice. Mechanistically, host FSTL1 enhanced rapid recycling of CCR2 to the membrane via activation of the CD14/TLR4/NF-κB/ATP6V1G2 axis, leading to early recruitment of Ly6C+ monocytes /macrophages. Taken together, our findings revealed that FSTL1 is a critical regulator of the fibrotic immune microenvironment and facilitates subsequent stem cell therapy. These data suggest that FSTL1 could serve as a predictive biomarker of stem cell therapy response in patients with liver cirrhosis.">

T-cell stimulation without SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens was used as a control. T-cell response was compared to B-cell response by evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We observed an upregulation of specific subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, our results demonstrate the induction of a broad and distinct CD4+ T-cell response in pwMS even on anti-CD20 treatment and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulation after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. This was particularly seen in CD4+high and CD4+CD154+ T cells. Our results do not support the induction of a CD8+ T-cell immune response. While humoral immune response was impaired in pwMS during ocrelizumab and fingolimod treatment, there was evidence of a compensatory upregulation of subpopulations of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells at low levels of seroconversion in pwMS. In conclusion, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms of the adaptive immune response in pwMS following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.">

        <tr id="The upper airway epithelium is the primary site of exposure to Bordetella pertussis and the initiator of host responses to this microbe. B. pertussis may cause serious respiratory infections resulting in major complications, as well as severe impairment of airway function. While pertussis treatment options are limited because the molecular responses in the upper respiratory tract in the early stages of infection have not been characterized. Here, we performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of nasal turbinates isolated from mice over 11 days after B. pertussis infection. Using RNA-seq, we characterized the differentially expressed genes and pathways associated with the changes in the nasal turbinates following infection. Statistical analysis revealed that infection is a dynamic process characterized by increased expression of a set of acute inflammatory responses at an early stage. After this initial inflammatory response, we observed increases in the levels of transcripts associated with the regulation of immune processes. In particular, we found that B. pertussis infection significantly increased the levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and related genes in the nasal turbinates at 2 h, 2 days, and 4 days postinfection. Therefore, we investigated the role of type I IFNs in B. pertussis infection in type I IFNs receptor-deficient (IFNAR1−/−) mice. There was no difference in bacterial clearance or adaptive immune responses between wild-type and IFNAR1−/− mice. However, a lack of type I IFNs signaling ameliorated pulmonary immunopathology, reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and limited the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung during B. pertussis infection. Thus, our findings suggest that inhibiting the effects of type I IFNs may contribute to dampening inflammation, which could be an approach for the treatment of B. pertussis infection and management of the associated disease symptoms.">

In this study, we evaluated whether Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), a serum marker of lung alveolar cell damage, is predictive for disease severity. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Serum levels of Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), soluble Fas Ligand, cytochrome C, thymus- and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) and of oxidate stress related proteins were analyzed. Clinical patient data were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. COVID-19 positive patients were divided in two groups according to disease severity. The mean day difference between COVID-19 diagnosis date and sampling date was +11 days. Concentrations of TARC were lower in COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative patients (unpaired t-test, p=0.002). In addition, CC16 serum levels were significantly elevated in sera taken from patients that were admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) (p=0.0082). In a matched cohort, sera taken prior to ICU admission (-3 days) contained higher CC16 levels (paired t-test, p=0.0072). Multivariable analyses adjusted for known risk factors (age, gender, blood counts, lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, underlying disease) showed that CC16 levels were independently associated to COVID-19 severity (interquartile-range, odds ratio 1.53, p=0.0102). In conclusion, our findings highlight CC16 as a promising biomarker for early identification of severe COVID19 cases, which could improve patient management and resource allocation.">

        <tr id="Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) initiates secondary injuries that worsen neurological damage and hinder recovery. While peripheral immune responses play a key role in stroke outcomes, clinical results from immunotherapy have been suboptimal, with limited focus on T-cell dynamics. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) offer therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. They can regulate immune responses and reduce neuroinflammation, potentially enhancing recovery by fostering a pro-regenerative peripheral immune environment. However, the effect of UMSCs on T-cell dynamics in AIS remains underexplored. This study investigates T-cell dynamics following AIS and examines how UMSCs may mitigate immune dysregulation to develop better treatment strategies. Methods AIS patients (NIHSS scores 0–15) were recruited within 72 h of stroke onset, with peripheral blood samples collected on Day 0 (enrollment) and Day 7. T-cell compartments were identified by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine levels were quantified using a cytometric bead array (CBA). Mitochondria in UMSCs were labeled with MitoTracker. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were isolated, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cocultured with UMSCs in both direct contact and Transwell systems. Flow cytometry, CBA, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect T-cell compartments, gene expression markers for helper T (Th) cell differentiation, cytokine profiles, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA in UMSCs was depleted. The effects of UMSCs and mitochondria-depleted UMSCs on ischemic stroke mice were compared through behavioral assessments and analysis of the peripheral immune microenvironment. Results In AIS, T-cell compartments underwent a phenotypic shift from naïve to effector or memory states, with a specific increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells, leading to alterations in T-cell-mediated immune functions. In an ex vivo co-culture system, LPS stimulation further amplified these disparities, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in T cells. Notably, UMSCs restored mitochondrial function and reversed the shift in T-cell compartments through mitochondrial transfer. Critically, UMSC treatment significantly improved both neurological deficits and peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke mice, whereas mitochondria-depleted UMSCs failed to produce this effect. Conclusions Our comprehensive insights into the key attributes of T-cell compartments in acute ischemic stroke and the immune regulatory mechanisms of UMSCs provide a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke and the therapeutic potential of UMSC treatment.

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="In this study, the critical role of the epipharynx in managing long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in particular, how residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA affects signalling pathways in the epipharynx were investigated via spatial gene expression analysis (Visium HD). Moreover, we hypothesize that epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) targeting the epipharynx could improve long COVID symptoms by modulating local inflammation and gene expression. We conducted a comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of three patients with long COVID and two control individuals without COVID-19. Residual SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the epipharynx of patients with long COVID, along with the activation of signalling pathways in epithelial and immune cells. After EAT, the viral RNA was either completely cleared or significantly reduced. T-cell receptor signalling pathways were suppressed; the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, were reduced; and excessive antibody production was mitigated. Histology showed that EAT effectively eliminated the inflamed, dysfunctional ciliated epithelium. This study clarifies that SARS-CoV-2 has long-term effects on the immune response in the epipharynx, emphasizing the need to focus on chronic epipharyngitis as a potential cause of long COVID. Furthermore, EAT may offer a promising approach to alleviating persistent long COVID symptoms.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a site of replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and GI symptoms are often reported by patients. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends upon heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, which commensal bacteria that bathe the human mucosa are known to modify. To explore human gut HS-modifying bacterial abundances and how their presence may impact SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a task-based analysis of proteoglycan degradation on large-scale shotgun metagenomic data. We observed that gut bacteria with high predicted catabolic capacity for HS differ by age and sex, factors associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and directly by disease severity during/after infection, but do not vary between subjects with COVID-19 comorbidities or by diet. Gut commensal bacterial HS-modifying enzymes reduce spike protein binding and infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bacterial grooming of the GI mucosa may impact viral susceptibility. IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, can infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and individuals who exhibit GI symptoms often have more severe disease. The GI tract’s glycocalyx, a component of the mucosa covering the large intestine, plays a key role in viral entry by binding SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein via heparan sulfate (HS). Here, using metabolic task analysis of multiple large microbiome sequencing data sets of the human gut microbiome, we identify a key commensal human intestinal bacteria capable of grooming glycocalyx HS and modulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro. Moreover, we engineered the common probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to effectively block SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection of human cell cultures. Understanding these microbial interactions could lead to better risk assessments and novel therapies targeting viral entry mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HAM/TSP is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease characterized by leukocyte infiltration in the spinal cord. T-lymphocytes are the most important targets of HTLV-1 infection, but monocytes are also infected. Monocytes from HTLV-1-infected individuals exhibit important functional differences compared to cells from uninfected donors. Here, we investigated the effects of cell-cell physical contact and/or secreted factors of HTLV-1-infected cells in monocyte activation and differentiation. Methods The THP-1 human monocytic cell line was co-cultured with a human cell line transformed by HTLV-1 (MT-2) for 6 days. To determine the effects of co-culturing HTLV-1-infected cells in THP-1 monocytes cells were characterized by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, and real-time PCR. Computational analysis of published transcriptomic datasets was realized to compare molecular profiles of macrophages and mononuclear cells from HTLV-1 carriers. Results Co-culture of monocytes with HTLV-1-infected cells induced macrophage differentiation and upregulation of typical macrophages-associated molecules (HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86), increased cytokine (TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β) levels and their coding genes expression. Consistently, published transcriptomic datasets showed changes in important genes associated with inflammation during HAM/TSP in patients. The presence of HTLV-1-infected cells in the culture also induced significant upregulation of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISG), indicating viral infection. Monocyte activation and differentiation into pro-inflammatory macrophages occurred in a cell-to-cell contact-independent manner, suggesting the role of factors secreted by infected cells. Conclusions Together, our results indicated that HTLV-1-infected cells induced monocyte differentiation into macrophages inflammatory, predominantly.

        <tr id="Significance Severe COVID-19 is associated with uncontrolled inflammation, leading to acute respiratory distress. We found that mice deficient in platelets’ 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) demonstrate exacerbated inflammation and worse outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. One mediator derived from platelet 12-LOX activity, 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), was found to negatively correlate with disease severity. Taken together our data unravel a possible role of platelets and possibly 12-HETrE, which is documented as promoting anti-inflammatory effects, in dampening the inflammatory burden of infected mice and pinpoints potential new therapeutic strategies (12-LOX inhibitors or 12-HETrE receptor agonists) to better combat severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Since the emergence of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, the disease has led to widespread acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), who are at increased risk due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy. This study aims to explore the differences in immune responses between kidney transplant recipients and non-kidney transplant recipients in COVID-19-induced ARDS to identify potential therapeutic targets for improving outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 108,320 cells derived from peripheral blood samples to construct a global single-cell map of COVID-19 induced ARDS in kidney transplant recipients(ARDSKT), COVID-19 induced ARDS in non transplant recipients(ARDSNKT), and healthy controls. Subsequently, using cellular clustering analysis, we obtained single-cell maps of different cell types. We employed enrichment analysis to determine the pathways involved in different subpopulations and focused on the role of key immune cells such as monocytes, megakaryocytes, B cells, and CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Significant immune differences were observed between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT. In ARDSKT, the S100A9+ MK subpopulation, which activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, was elevated, promoting inflammation. In contrast, the S100A12+ monocyte subpopulation that activates the chemokine signaling pathway was more abundant in ARDSNKT, reflecting a stronger inflammatory response, while its abundance was reduced in ARDSKT due to immunosuppression. The CXCR4+ B subpopulation, crucial for adaptive immunity, was significantly reduced in ARDSKT. Additionally, the XAF1+ Teff subpopulation, associated with apoptosis, was more abundant in ARDSKT, potentially impairing immune recovery. This study highlights the immune differences between ARDSKT and ARDSNKT, revealing the impact of immunosuppression on immune dysregulation. These findings suggest that targeting specific immune pathways can improve therapeutic strategies for ARDSKT.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus that can infect the brain, and an uncontrolled infection can lead to a range of diseases, including chronic nerve pain, encephalitis, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. These outcomes are often severe and have lasting consequences, highlighting the need to identify host factors that contribute to disease severity. In this study, we report that intranasal HSV-1 infection in murine model, which promotes viral dissemination into the brain, implicates the host protein heparanase (HPSE) as a key mediator of neuroinflammation. Specifically, we observed that the HPSE activity during HSV-1 infection in naïve animals promotes the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, enhances microglial activity in the brain, and contributes to cognitive impairment, anxiety, and motor coordination deficits. Such effects are significantly less detectable in heparanase deficient (Hpse−/−) mice. Additionally, we found that moderate activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), particularly in Hpse+/+ mice, may contribute to the activation of the inflammasome pathway. This, in turn, leads to the activation of caspase-1 (Casp1) and caspase-3 (Casp3), which may play a role in nerve function loss. Our findings position HPSE as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating virus-induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral defects. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection in the brain can lead to severe and often permanent neurological consequences. Host factors influence disease outcomes in response to infection, and understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective therapies. This study identifies the host protein HPSE as a key mediator of neuroinflammation in response to HSV-1 infection. We demonstrate that the HPSE activity drives proinflammatory cytokine expression and microglial activation and promotes a signaling cascade involving toll-like receptors and caspase activation, potentially intensifying neuroinflammatory responses. These findings implicate HPSE as an important player in HSV-1 pathogenesis in the central nervous system and suggest that targeting HPSE could provide a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate virus-induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioral disturbance.">

        <tr id="Vesiculovirus carajas (CARV) is a pathogen with neuroinvasive potential, yet its impact on neuroinflammation and sickness behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuropathological and immunological responses to CARV encephalitis in adult BALB/c mice. Mice were intranasally inoculated with either infected or uninfected brain homogenates, and clinical, histopathological, and cytokine profiles were analyzed. CARV antigens were primarily detected in necrotic neurons, with prominent microglial activation near the ventricles and blood vessels. By day 10 post-infection, infected mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of MCP-1, IFN-γ, IL-12 p70, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in the brain, indicating a strong inflammatory response. These findings highlight the inflammatory modulation associated with CARV infection and suggest a hematogenous route of neuroinvasion, distinguishing CARV from other vesiculovirus species. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of CARV encephalitis and its potential impact on neuroimmune dynamics.">

        <tr id="The constrained cross-talk between myeloid cells and T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) restricts cancer immunotherapy efficacy, whereas the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2−/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor. Our findings uncover Parkin’s involvement in suppressing macrophage antigen presentation for coordinating the cross-talk between macrophages and T cells.">

        <tr id="The health burden of ocular toxoplasmosis is substantial, and there is an unmet need for safe and curative anti-microbial drugs. One major barrier to research on new therapeutics is the lack of in vitro human-based models beyond two-dimensional cultured cells and tissue explants. We aimed to address this research gap by establishing a human retinal organoid model of ocular toxoplasmosis. Retinal organoids, generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells and grown to two stages of organization, were incubated with a suspension of live or heat-killed GT-1 strain T. gondii tachyzoites, or medium without tachyzoites. Both developing (1 month post-isolation) and matured (6 months post-isolation) organoids were susceptible to infection. Spread of live parasites from the margin to the entire organoid over 1 week was indicated by immunolabelling for T. gondii surface antigen 1. This progression was accompanied by changes in the levels of selected tachyzoite transcripts—SAG1, GRA6, and ROP16—and human cytokine transcripts—CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, and IL6—in infected versus control conditions. Our human retinal organoid model of ocular toxoplasmosis offers the opportunity for many future lines of study, including tachyzoite interactions with retinal cell populations and leukocyte subsets, parasite stage progression, and disease processes of different T. gondii strains, as well as drug testing.">

        <tr id="Molecular changes underlying the persistent health effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. To discern the gene regulatory landscape in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients, we performed enzymatic DNA methylome and single-cell RNA sequencing in nasal cells of COVID-19 patients (n = 19, scRNA-seq n = 14) and controls (n = 14, scRNA-seq n = 10). In addition, we resampled a subset of these patients for transcriptome analyses at 3 (n = 7) and 12 months (n = 5) post infection and followed the expression of differentially regulated genes over time. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 3112 differentially methylated regions between COVID-19 patients and controls. Hypomethylated regions affected immune regulatory genes, while hypermethylated regions were associated with genes governing ciliary function. These genes were not only downregulated in the acute phase of the disease but sustained repressed up to 12 months post infection in ciliated cells. Validation in an independent cohort collected 6 months post infection (n  = 15) indicated symptom-dependent transcriptional repression of ciliary genes. We therefore propose that hypermethylation observed in the acute phase may exert a long-term effect on gene expression, possibly contributing to post-acute COVID-19 sequelae.">

        <tr id="Background COVID-19 appears to have a progression of three stages. The latter stage is characterized by a high level of cytokine release, which in turn triggers an uncontrolled reaction known as cytokine storm where mast cells are involved. The presence of anti-IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this phase has been previously reported, suggesting an association with the severity of the disease. Our study aims to assess the prognostic significance of IgE antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 across a spectrum of clinical presentations, including individual with mild symptoms, hospitalized patients, and those who presented a critical progression. Methods The study included 64 patients distributed into the following groups: 22 critically ill hospitalized individuals (Critical); 21 non-critical hospitalized patients (Severe); 21 mild symptomatic non-hospitalized cases (Mild); and 22 healthy blood donors with samples collected in October 2019. Anti-IgE antibodies against Spike (S) protein were detected using a homemade ELISA, where the plate was sensitized with the RBD of recombinant S protein. Results Among 64 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 28.1% tested positive for IgE isotype antibodies against S protein RBD, whose prevalence was similar across severity groups: Mild 23.8%, Severe 28.6%, and Critical 31.8% (p = 0.842). Patients with IgE response exhibited higher levels of LDH compared to non-IgE responders, with a 40% increase (p = 0.037), and a non-significantly higher tendency in other inflammatory markers. Conclusion In SARS-CoV-2 infection, roughly a fourth of patients presented an IgE isotype response, regardless of disease severity, which is associated with higher levels of LDH.

        <tr id="Recent studies have shown an increased abundance of Sphingomonas paucimobilis, an aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium with a distinctive cell envelope rich in glycosphingolipids, within the gut microbiome of individuals with Alzheimer Disease (AD). However, the fact that S. paucimobilis is a well-known pathogen associated with nosocomial infections presents a significant challenge in investigating whether its presence in the gut microbiome is detrimental or beneficial, particularly in the context of AD. This study examines the impact of S. paucimobilis-derived extracellular vesicles (Spa-EV) on Aβ-induced pathology in cellular and animal models of AD. Microarray analysis reveals that Spa-EV treatment modulates Aβ42-induced alterations in gene expression in both HT22 neuronal cells and BV2 microglia cells. Among the genes significantly affected by Spa-EV, notable examples include Bdnf, Nt3/4, and Trkb, which are key players of neurotrophic signaling; Pgc1α, an upstream regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis; Mecp2 and Sirt1, epigenetic factors that regulate numerous gene expressions; and Il1β, Tnfα, and Nfκb-p65, which are associated with neuroinflammation. Remarkably, Spa-EV effectively reverses Aβ42-induced alteration in the expression of these genes through the upregulation of Mecp2. Furthermore, administration of Spa-EV in Tg-APP/PS1 mice restores the reduced expression of neurotrophic factors, Pgc1α, MeCP2, and Sirt1, while suppressing the increased expression of proinflammatory genes in the brain. Our results indicate that Spa-EV has the potential to reverse Aβ-induced dysregulation of gene expression in neuronal and microglial cells. These alterations encompass those essential for neurotrophic signaling and neuronal plasticity, mitochondrial function, and the regulation of inflammatory processes.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections remain a significant public health burden globally with infected individuals at high risk for cognitive decline and memory loss even on combination antiretroviral therapy. Almost half of HIV infected individuals smoke, which drives poorer health outcomes including a higher dementia rate. Microglia are the brain’s immune cells that serve as a persistent HIV reservoir contributing to neuroinflammatory signaling. We examined interactions between the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 and nicotine within human microglia cells (HMC3) that endogenously express chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) shows that gp120 alters mitochondria proteins within HMC3 cells. In the presence of nicotine, gp120 increased the expression of mitochondrial prohibitin 2 (PHB2), cytochrome c (cyt c), and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) but decreased fission 1 (FIS1) levels. An analysis of mito-YFP expression confirms that interaction between nicotine and gp120 increases the size and branching of mitochondrial networks. Interaction between nicotine and gp120 is also surprisingly found to promote the release of amyloid precursor protein (APP) peptides from microglia. This was accompanied by visualization of amyloid containing vesicles that colocalized with the autophagy protein LC3B-II in the cell. Taken together, our findings show that interaction between nicotine and gp120 impact microglia in a manner that regulates mitochondrial proteins and network properties and impacts amyloid protein management and release within microglia. These mechanisms may contribute to understanding neuroinflammatory signaling in smokers with HIV.

Pathophysiological findings of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder suggest cerebellar functional deficits. However, the link between stress-induced microglia reactivity and cerebellar dysfunction is missing. Here, we investigate the developmental immune environment in translational mouse models that combine two risk factors: maternal infection and repeated social defeat stress (2HIT). We find the synergy of inflammatory stress insults, leading to microglial increase specifically in the cerebellum of both sexes. Microglial turnover correlates with the Purkinje neuron loss in 2HIT mice. Highly multiplexed imaging-mass-cytometry identifies a cell transition to TREM2(+) stress-associated microglia in the cerebellum. Single-cell-proteomic clustering reveals IL-6- and TGFβ-signaling association with microglial cell transitions. Reduced excitability of remaining Purkinje cells, cerebellum-involved brain-wide functional dysconnectivity, and behavioral abnormalities indicate cerebellar cognitive dysfunctions in 2HIT animals, which are ameliorated by both systemic and cerebellum-specific microglia replacement.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Monkeypox virus (Mpox) has been recognized for causing distinct skin lesions and is primarily transmitted through skin and sexual contact. To date, the transmissibility and pathogenesis of the Mpox virus in distal human lung has never been completely explored. Here the transmission pathways and Mpox tropism on patient-derived air-liquid epithelium (ALE) model fabricated using isolated primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAECs) were investigated. hAECs were cultured and exposed to the Mpox virus clade IIb isolated from the patient. DNA, proteins, and the tropism were elucidated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and high-content fluorescent imaging. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to systematically observe the cellular distribution of viral particles. Viral titres were determined by TCID50 assay. Innate immune response and inflammatory mediators were measured using Milliplex® multiplex and ELISA analysis. Pathology at alveolar barrier integrity was determined using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) analysis. The study included mock-infected cells as control. Mpox virus significantly infected 42.82% of total hAEC populations. The prominent observed pathology included a significant reduction in TEER values, loss of tight junction protein, presence of tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), and syncytium morphology. Four stages of Mpox biogenesis were clearly observed without significant activation of IL-6, MIP1alpha, TNF-α, and Galectin-9, although IL-1β were subtly promoted. The developed patient-derived ALE is a versatile model for Mpox virus clade IIb infection reflecting respiratory transmission competence of the Mpox. Postinfection lung pathogenesis demonstrated alveolar barrier damage without significant inflammation, raising concerns about possible immune evasion by the virus.">

        <tr id="Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) ligands effectively reduce immunopathological damage in viral pneumonia models. Specifically, S1P1 ligands inhibit cytokine storm and help preserve lung endothelial barrier integrity. We recently showed that the S1P receptor ligand ozanimod can be safely administered to hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibiting severe symptoms of viral pneumonia, with potential clinical benefits. Here, we extend on this study and investigate the impact of ozanimod on key features of the immune response in patients with severe COVID-19. We quantified circulating cytokine levels, peripheral immune cell numbers, proportions and activation status; we also monitored the quality of the humoral response by assessing anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) antibodies. Our findings reveal that patients receiving ozanimod during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit significantly reduced numbers of circulating monocytes compared with those receiving standard care. Correspondingly, in the ozanimod-treated group, circulating levels of C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) were decreased. While treatment with ozanimod negatively impacted the humoral response to COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, it did not impair the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in vaccinated patients. These findings suggest that ozanimod influences key immune mechanisms during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can provide information on patient immunity, identify asymptomatic patients, and track the spread of COVID-19. Efforts have been made to develop methods to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Here, we describe a flow cytometric assay for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM in human plasma. To assess the antibody response against the different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, five viral recombinant proteins, including spike protein subunit 1 (S1), N-terminal domain of S1 (S1A), spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike protein subunit 2 (S2), and nucleocapsid protein (N), were generated. A comparison of the antibody profiles detected by the assay with plasma from 100 healthy blood donors collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and plasma from 100 virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated a clear discrimination between the two groups. Among the COVID-19 patients, the antibody responses for the viral proteins, as determined by their prevalence, were anti-RBD IgG = anti-N IgG > anti-S1 IgG > anti-S1A IgG > anti-S2 IgG, and anti-RBD IgM > anti-S1 IgM > anti-N IgM > anti-S2 IgM. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM was not associated with sex, age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness, except for a higher prevalence of anti-S2 IgG being observed in men than in women. The levels of anti-RBD IgG were higher in patients 65 years and older and in patients who had severe symptoms. Similarly, patients who had severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of anti-S1 and anti-S1A IgG than patients who had mild or moderate symptoms. The levels of anti-RBD IgM tended to be higher in men but did not differ among age, race, days after the onset of symptoms, or severity of illness. Our study indicates that the flow cytometric assay, especially using RBD as target antigen, can be used to detect simultaneously anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in human plasma.">

        <tr id="Background Cell-mediated immunity may provide durable protection against severe COVID-19, including among solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). This exploratory analysis in the open-label phase 3b trial evaluated cell-mediated immunity of mRNA-1273 in a subset of participants (59 kidney and 33 liver SOTRs; 12 immunocompetent participants). Methods In Part A, SOTRs received three 100-µg doses of mRNA-1273; immunocompetent participants received two doses. In Part B, an additional 100-µg dose was offered ≥4 months after the primary series. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-specific T-cell responses were measured by intracellular cytokine staining and polyfunctionality analyses. Results The primary series and additional dose of mRNA-1273 induced S protein-specific CD4+ T-cell responses exhibiting a Th-1-biased profile in both SOTRs and immunocompetent participants; however, response rates and magnitudes were lower among SOTRs. S protein-specific Th-2 CD4+ T-cell responses were below those observed for Th-1; CD8+ T-cell responses were not as robust among SOTRs compared with immunocompetent participants. Kidney SOTRs received multiple immunosuppressants and had lower cell-mediated immunity responses than liver SOTRs. Polyfunctional responses exhibited Th-1 cytokine signatures with ≤5 functional markers reported in SOTRs and immunocompetent participants. Conclusion Overall, a three-dose mRNA-1273 primary series elicited Th-1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses among SOTRs that were improved with an additional dose.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of human activity worldwide, frequently resulting in post-acute sequelae and affecting multiple organ systems. The underlying mechanisms driving both acute and post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 are still poorly understood, warranting further investigation for new targets. The study represents the first attempt to explore the role of T-cadherin in COVID-19 pathogenesis as well as its implications in pulmonary fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction. First, we revealed a significant decrease in T-cadherin expression in post-mortem lung samples from COVID-19 patients. This downregulated T-cadherin expression correlated with the elevated levels of VE-cadherin and reduced levels of β-catenin, suggesting a disruption in endothelial cell-cell contact integrity and function. Second, the reciprocal relation of T-cadherin and VE-cadherin expression was further confirmed using cultured human endothelial Ea.hy926 cells. T-cadherin overexpression caused a decrease in VE-cadherin mRNA expression in cultured endothelial cells providing additional evidence in favor of their interplay. Third, employing Cdh13 −/− mice, we unveiled the protective role of T-cadherin deficiency against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Fourth, we demonstrated the mice lacking T-cadherin to have downregulated reactive oxygen species production and Nox2 mRNA expression in an angiotensin II-mediated endothelial dysfunction model. Our findings provide rationale for further studies into T-cadherin-mediated mechanisms in these processes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

Here, we present clinical, pathological, and virological analyses of three cases of prolonged COVID-19 among patients undergoing treatment for B-cell lymphoma. These patients had all been treated with anti-CD20 antibody and bendamustine. Despite various antiviral treatments, high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) levels persisted for >4 weeks, and two of them succumbed to COVID-19. The autopsy showed bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrosis. Overlapping cytomegalovirus, fungal and/or bacterial infections were also confirmed. Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed accumulation of mutations and changes in variant allele frequencies over time. NSP12 mutations V792I and M794I appeared independently in two cases as COVID-19 progressed. In vitro drug susceptibility analysis and an animal experiment using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that each mutation, V792 and M794I, was independently responsible for remdesivir resistance and attenuated pathogenicity. E340A, E340D, and F342INS mutations in the spike protein were found in one case, which may account for the sotrovimab resistance. Analysis of autopsy specimens indicated heterogeneous distribution of these mutations. In summary, we demonstrated temporal and spatial diversity in SARS-CoV-2 that evolved resistance to various antiviral agents in malignant lymphoma patients under immunodeficient conditions caused by certain types of immunochemotherapies. Strategies may be necessary to prevent the acquisition of drug resistance and improve outcomes, such as the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for lymphoma considering patients’ immune status and the institution of early intensive antiviral therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Mycobacterium abscessus complex pulmonary disease (MABC-PD) is a chronic and often relapsing disease with considerable morbidity, especially among individuals with other chronic pulmonary conditions. A major clinical challenge lies in distinguishing infection-related symptoms from underlying lung disease and identifying reliable prognosticators to guide treatment decisions and monitoring therapeutic response. Methodology/Principal Findings To address the gaps in clinically relevant indicators, we profiled whole blood transcriptome and 45 plasma proteins of MABC-PD patients across different disease and treatment phases. Whole blood bulk RNA-sequencing revealed that MABC-PD patients with progressive disease exhibited elevated expression of genes related to innate immune and inflammatory responses, with reduced abundance of genes associated with peripheral T and NK cells. Among the 45 plasma cytokines and chemokines profiled, plasma levels of TNFSF10 were significantly reduced, while IFNγ, interleukin-17F (IL17F) and IL17C were elevated in patients with disease progression, despite the reduced abundance of peripheral T and NK cell-associated genes, suggesting recruitment of activated T cells to infection sites in the lungs during disease progression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of IFNγ and IL17F demonstrated strong predictive performance for differentiating patients with disease progression from healthy controls, with AUCs of 0.946 (95% CI 0.829-1.000) and 0.875 (95% CI 0.6699-1), respectively. Conclusions These findings provide insights into the immune profiles of MABC-PD patients during disease progression and suggest that T cell-associated cytokines, such as IFNγ and IL17F, could serve as useful biomarkers for identifying those under watchful waiting or post-treatment who are at risk of disease progression, thereby aiding in more timely and targeted therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background COVID‐19 exhibits a variety of symptoms and may lead to multi‐organ failure and death. This clinical complexity is exacerbated by significant immune dysregulation affecting nearly all cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. Granulocytes, including eosinophils, are affected by SARS‐CoV‐2. Objectives Eosinophil responses remain poorly understood despite early recognition of eosinopenia as a hallmark feature of COVID‐19 severity. Results The heterogeneous nature of eosinophil responses categorizes them as dual‐function cells with contradictory effects. Eosinophil activation can suppress virus‐induced inflammation by releasing type 2 cytokines like IL‐13 and granular proteins with antiviral action such as eosinophil‐derived neurotoxins and eosinophil cationic protein, and also by acting as antigen‐presenting cells. In contrast, eosinophil accumulation in the lungs can induce tissue damage triggered by cytokines or hormones like IFN‐γ and leptin. Additionally, they can affect adaptive immune functions by interacting with T cells through direct formation of membrane complexes or soluble mediator action. Individuals with allergic disorders who have elevated levels of eosinophils in tissues and blood, such as asthma, do not appear to be at an increased risk of developing severe COVID‐19 following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. However, the SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine appears to be associated with complications and eosinophilic infiltrate‐induced immunopathogenicity, which can be mitigated by corticosteroid, anti‐histamines and anti‐IL‐5 therapy and avoided by modifying adjuvants or excipients. Conclusion This review highlights the importance of eosinophils in COVID‐19 and contributes to a better understanding of their role during natural infection and vaccination.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lung diseases are widespread worldwide. Pulmonary immunity plays a vital role against lung pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the pathogenesis, including the development of local immune responses to infection, is fundamental for developing interventions to control the viral infection. Methods Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and euthanized 11–14 days later. Results Tertiary lymphoid tissue was found in all SARS-CoV-2 infected animals. The number (13.9 vs 1.5 iPLT number/ lung cm2), size (25992 vs 13946 µm2) and total area (0.46 vs 0.02 mm2 iPLT/ lung cm2) of the lymphoid tissue aggregations were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals than that of normal controls. This induced pulmonary lymphoid tissues comprised B cells, T cells, CD169 macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells with evidence of lymphocyte priming and differentiation. Discussion The results suggest local immunity plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further study of pulmonary immunity could lead to new interventions to develop vaccine strategies and discover new immune-regulatory biomarkers in monitoring and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection and other lung diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to COVID19 disease and caused a worldwide pandemic in 2019. Since the first wave of infections, there has been significant antigenic shifts, leading to the emergence of new variants. Today, infections have shifted away from the severe, fatal infection seen in 2019. Objective This study aimed to assess how the plasma metabolomes from patients varied with infection with different strains and could reflect disease severity. Methods Patients with COVID19 not requiring intensive care were recruited between January 2021 and May 2022 from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; 33 patients with alpha, 13 delta and 14 omicron variants. These were compared to 26 age matched contemporaneously recruited controls. Plasma samples were extracted into chloroform/methanol/water (1:2.5/1 v/v) and assessed by flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Derived data were assessed using the R based MetaboAnalyst platform. Results Plasma metabolomes from COVID19 patients were clearly different from controls. Metabolite variation could be related to infection with different SARS-CoV2 variants. Variant showed different levels of some phospholipids, ganglioside GD1a and a dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative. Correlations of the plasma metabolomes indicated negative correlations between selected phospholipids and the levels of C-reactive protein, creatinine, neutrophil and D-dimer. Conclusion The plasma metabolomes of COVID19 patients show changes, particularly in phospholipids, which could reflect disease severity and SARS-CoV2 variant infection.

        <tr id="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged the current understanding of the complement cascade mechanisms of host immune responses during infection-induced nonresolvable lung disease. While the complement system is involved in opsonization and phagocytosis of the invading pathogens, uncontrolled complement activation also leads to aberrant autophagic response and tissue damage. Our recent study revealed unique pathologic and fibrotic signature genes associated with epithelial bronchiolization in the lung tissues of patients with nonresolvable COVID-19 (NR-COVID-19) requiring lung transplantation. However, there is a knowledge gap if complement components are modulated to contribute to tissue damage and the fibrotic phenotype during NR-COVID-19. We, therefore, aimed to study the role of the complement factors and their corresponding regulatory proteins in the pathogenesis of NR-COVID-19. We further examined the association of complement components with mediators of the host autophagic response. We observed significant upregulation of the expression of the classical pathway factor C1qrs and alternative complement factors C3 and C5a, as well as the anaphylatoxin receptor C5aR1, in NR-COVID-19 lung tissues. Of note, complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor (DAF; CD55) was significantly downregulated at both transcript and protein levels in the NR-COVID-19 lungs, indicating a dampened host protective response. Furthermore, we observed significantly decreased levels of the autophagy mediators PPARγ and LC3a/b, which was corroborated by decreased expression of factor P and the C3b receptor CR1, indicating impaired clearance of damaged cells that may contribute to the fibrotic phenotype in NR-COVID-19 patients. Thus, our study revealed previously unrecognized complement dysregulation associated with impaired cell death and clearance of damaged cells, which may promote NR-COVID-19 in patients, ultimately necessitating lung transplantation. The identified network of dysregulated complement cascade activity indicates the interplay of regulatory factors and the receptor-mediated modulation of host immune and autophagic responses as potential therapeutic targets for treating NR-COVID-19.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Oxidative stress (OS) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and may be associated with sequelae after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study evaluated OS and inflammation biomarkers in blood from individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). 64 male and female participants were distributed into three groups: healthy individuals (n = 20), acute COVID-19 patients (symptoms for <3 weeks, n = 15), and PASC patients (symptoms for >12 weeks, n = 29). Analyses included inflammatory cytokines, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and OS markers, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), reduced glutathione (GSH), uric acid (UA), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and protein carbonyls (PC). Individuals with PASC showed increased IL-6 and IL-8. Both COVID-19 groups exhibited decreased SOD and CAT. GST decreased only in the acute group. Elevated GGT and GSH were found in the PASC group. High UA levels were observed in PASC individuals. There were no changes in TBARS values ⁣⁣in the PASC group. However, PC concentrations were elevated only in this group. Correlations were identified between inflammatory markers and OS parameters. These findings suggest that individuals with PASC pronounced OS, which potentially exacerbates disease complications. Monitoring OS biomarkers could aid in patient prognosis and management.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoinflammatory disease of unknown origin, involving characterized by immune cell infiltration into the target tissue, central nervous system (CNS), resulting in local and/or systemic inflammation. The symptoms vary from gait disturbance, visual impairment and learning and memory impairment and are being managed with corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive agents. However, several patients do not respond to these treatments, which can also elevate the risk of severe infections. Therefore, there remains an ongoing need to identify new therapeutic targets. MS exhibits distinctive pathology, clinical course, and treatment responses, suggesting the importance of targeting disease site-specific immune cells to mitigate immune system-induced inflammation, rather than employing broad immunosuppression. Chemokines and chemokine receptors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MS by recruiting immune cells to the CNS, leading to inflammation and demyelination. Therapies targeting chemokines have shown promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials, but more research is needed to fully understand their mechanisms and optimize their efficacy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are essential players in the immune response to infections, involved in shaping innate and adaptive immunity. However, a complete understanding of their specific roles in respiratory infections, including SARS‐CoV‐2, remains elusive. Methods To investigate the dynamics of monocytes and DCs in blood as well as the upper and lower airways, we sampled 147 patients with varying degree of COVID‐19 severity longitudinally during the spring of 2020. Results Using flow cytometry, proteomics and in vitro TLR stimulation, we found differences in the distribution and function of monocytes and DCs in patients compared with controls, and importantly, reduced levels of DCs in both blood and airways. In fact, lower frequencies of cDC2s (Lin− HLA‐DR+ CD1c+) early after symptom onset predicted subsequent severe disease, and depletion of DC subsets lasted longer in patients with more severe disease. In contrast, severe COVID‐19 was associated with increased frequencies of activated monocytes in the lower, but not the upper, airways. Proteomic analysis showed that monocyte and DC‐related cytokines in plasma and airways associated with disease severity. During convalescence, cell frequencies and responses to TLR ligands normalised in blood, except for persistently low plasmacytoid DCs. Conclusion Our study reveals a distinct pattern of recruitment of monocytes but not DCs to the airways during severe COVID‐19. Instead, decreased levels of DCs in both blood and airways were found, possibly contributing to more severe COVID‐19. The connection between low blood DCs early in disease course and more severe outcomes provides insight into COVID‐19 immunopathology, with possible therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="Objectives/Goals: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to impact multiple organ systems, including the brain, and is associated with increased cognitive decline in vulnerable populations. The gut microbiome may play a significant role in modulating these effects, as shifts in microbiota composition have been linked to inflammation and systemic disease processes. Methods/Study Population: To explore these interactions, we conducted an acute COVID-19 study using 12-week-old C57 mice intranasally inoculated with 1x10^4 PFU of the Mouse Adapted 10 (MA-10) strain of SARS-CoV-2. On day 5 postinfection, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing on fecal samples, analyzed using QIIME2 and DeSeq2, to assess microbiome alterations and identify changes in metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory responses. Results/Anticipated Results: Analysis revealed notable shifts in the gut microbiome during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, with significant alterations in metabolic pathways related to inflammation and immune regulation. These changes suggest that early gut microbiome disruptions may contribute to the host response in acute COVID-19. Discussion/Significance of Impact: Our findings indicate that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to rapid alterations in the gut microbiome, which could underlie inflammatory and immune pathways impacting disease progression. These insights highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapies to mitigate acute COVID-19 morbidity and warrant further investigation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Aim COVID‐19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) as a pandemic infectious disease. So far, it has been known that this virus uses several receptors to enter the host cell, one of which is neuropilin‐1 (NRP1). Also, one of the main causes of clinical manifestations, severity of disease, and mortality of patients is cytokine storm syndrome, one of these cytokines being interleukin (IL)‐6. Our aim was to study the level of expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Materials and Methods Our study population included the test group (80 patients with COVID‐19) and the control group (30 healthy individuals). Venous blood was taken from all subjects. After isolating PBMCs from blood using Ficoll, RNA was extracted. Then, cDNA synthesis, the expression level of NRP1 and IL‐6 compared to GAPDH housekeeping gene was measured by real‐time PCR. Results The level of NRP1 gene expression was increased significantly in COVID‐19 different groups compared to the control group. Surprisingly, it was observed that the amount of NRP1 gene decreased in the vaccinated group compared to nonvaccinated groups. IL‐6 gene expression was also significantly increased in all groups except vaccinated patients compared to the control group. Also, the results indicated that there was a positive and statistically considerable relationship between IL‐6 expression level and NRP1 expression level (p = 0.03). Conclusion The significant increase in the expression of NRP1 and IL‐6 genes in COVID‐19 patients, especially in moderate and severe cases, indicates their potential involvement in the progression of the disease, which may serve as biomarkers of disease severity. Also, since these genes play an important role in causing severe inflammation, cytokine storm, and immunopathological complications of COVID‐19, further investigations maybe needed to achieve therapeutic goals to control COVID‐19 and similar diseases.">

        <tr id="Background: Abnormal activation of microglia occurs in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and leads to subsequent neuroinflammation and major AD pathologies. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as great potential therapeutic targets in AD. However, the extent of circRNAs entwined and the underlying mechanism in microglia-driven neuroinflammation in AD remain elusive. Methods: The circular RNA Dlg1 (circDlg1) was identified using circRNA microarray screening in magnetic-isolated microglia of APP/PS1 mice. CircDlg1 expression in microglia of APP/PS1 mice and AD patients was validated by FISH. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were conducted to explore the roles of circDlg1 in microglia. Adeno-associated virus 9 preparations for interfering with microglial circDlg1 were microinjected into mouse lateral ventricle to explore influences on microglial response, neuroinflammation and AD pathologies. Y-maze, novel object recognition and Morris water maze tasks were performed to assess cognitive performance. RNA pulldown assays, mass spectrometry analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to validate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of circDlg1. Results: A novel circular RNA circDlg1 was observed elevated using circRNA microarray screening in microglia isolated from APP/PS1 mice and validated increased in intracerebral microglia of AD patients. Microglia-specific knockdown of circDlg1 remarkably ameliorated microglial recruitment and envelopment of amyloid-β (Aβ), mitigated neuroinflammation, and prevented cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, circDlg1 interfered with the interaction between phosphodiesterase 4b (PDE4B) and Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase of PDE4B. The formed ternary complex protected PDE4B from ubiquitination-dependent degradation via unique N-terminal targeting domain, thus consequently decreasing cAMP levels. We further confirmed that microglial circDlg1 downregulation significantly activated PKA/CREB anti-inflammatory pathway by decreasing PDE4B protein levels in APP/PS1 mice. Conclusion: The novel microglia-upregulated circDlg1 tightly involves in neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice via determining the protein fate of PDE4B. Microglial loss of circDlg1 promotes microglial protective response to Aβ deposition and relieves neuroinflammation, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy that specifically targets the microglial response in AD.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of death in patients with COVID-19. β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis). In this study, we developed a SARS-CoV-2-infected A549-hACE2 cell model to evaluate the efficacy of the A549-hACE2 monoclonal cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The A549-hACE2 cells were then subjected to either knockdown or overexpression of the effector β-catenin, and the modified cells were subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we employed transcriptomics and raw letter analysis approaches to investigate other potential effects of β-catenin on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We successfully established a model of cellular fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung-derived cells. This model can be utilized to investigate the molecular biological mechanisms and cellular signaling pathways associated with virus-induced lung fibrosis. The results of our mechanistic studies indicate that β-catenin plays a significant role in lung fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the inhibition of β-catenin mitigated the accumulation of mesenchymal stroma in A549-hACE2 cells. Additionally, β-catenin knockdown was found to facilitate multi-pathway crosstalk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that β-catenin overexpression did not exacerbate cellular fibrosis may be attributed to the activation of PPP2R2B.">

Previous studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs); however, the subsequent effects on hematopoiesis and immune reconstitution have not yet been described. Here we evaluated the pathological effects of infection of umbilical-cord-blood-derived HSPCs with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant pseudovirus (PsV). Transcriptomic analysis of Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, aging and the NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting a potential trigger of inflammaging. Omicron PsV-infected HSPCs presented decreased numbers of multipotential progenitors (granulocyte‒erythrocyte‒macrophage‒megakaryocyte colony-forming units) ex vivo and repopulated primitive hematopoietic stem cells (Ki-67−hCD34+ cells) in an HSPC transplantation NOD-scid IL2rγnull mouse model (Omicron mouse). Furthermore, Omicron PsV infection induced myeloid-biased differentiation of HSPCs. Treatment with nanographene oxide, an antiviral agent, partially mitigated the myeloid bias and inflammaging phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the abnormal hematopoietic and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight potential therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The SAR-CoV-2 virus has evolved to co-exist with human hosts, albeit at a substantial energetic cost resulting in post-infection neurological manifestations [Neuro-post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)] that significantly impact public health and economic productivity on a global scale. One of the main molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of Neuro-PASC, in individuals of all ages, is the formation and inadequate proteolysis/clearance of phase-separated amyloid crystalline aggregates—a hallmark feature of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. Amyloidogenesis during viral infection and persistence is a natural, inevitable, protective defense response that is exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2. Acting as chemical catalyst, SARS-CoV-2 accelerates hydrophobic collapse and the heterogeneous nucleation of amorphous amyloids into stable β-sheet aggregates. The clearance of amyloid aggregates is most effective during slow wave sleep, when high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—a biphasic modulator of biomolecular condensates—and melatonin are available to solubilize amyloid aggregates for removal. The dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics by SARS-CoV-2, in particular fusion and fission homeostasis, impairs the proper formation of distinct mitochondrial subpopulations that can remedy challenges created by the diversion of substrates away from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis to support viral replication and maintenance. The subsequent reduction of ATP and inhibition of melatonin synthesis during slow wave sleep results in incomplete brain clearance of amyloid aggregates, leading to the development of neurological manifestations commonly associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Exogenous melatonin not only prevents mitochondrial dysfunction but also elevates ATP production, effectively augmenting the solubilizing effect of the adenosine moiety to ensure the timely, optimal disaggregation and clearance of pathogenic amyloid aggregates in the prevention and attenuation of Neuro-PASC.">

In this opinion, we review how advances in human nose and lung organoid models, which are able to express all cell types of the respiratory epithelia, i.e., Club, basal, goblet, and ciliated cells, have provided novel insight into the pathogenesis, age-dependent susceptibility, viral attenuation signature, and immune mechanisms of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. The models have also demonstrated potential for studying hitherto uncultivable human viruses and to be useful for studies of zoonotic risk.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (e.g. H5N1) infects the lower airway to cause severe infections, and constitute a prime candidate for the emergence of disease X. The nasal epithelium is the primary portal of entry for respiratory pathogens, serving as the airway's physical and immune barrier. While HPAI virus predominantly infects the lower airway, not much is known about its interactions with the nasal epithelium. Hence, we sought to elucidate and compare the differential responses of the nasal epithelium against HPAI infection that may contribute to its pathology, and to identify critical response markers. We infected human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) cultured at the air–liquid interface from multiple healthy donors with clinical isolates of major human seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, influenza B) and HPAI H5N1. The infected cells were subjected to virologic, transcriptomic and secretory protein analyses. While less adapted to infecting the nasal epithelium, HPAI H5N1 elicited unique host responses unlike seasonal influenza. Interestingly, H5N1 infection of hNECs induced responses indicative of subdued antiviral activity (e.g. reduced expression of IFNβ, and inflammasome mediators, IL-1α and IL-1β); decreased wound healing; suppressed re-epithelialization; compromised epithelial barrier integrity; diminished responses to oxidative stress; and increased transmembrane solute and ion carrier gene expression. These unique molecular changes in response to H5N1 infection may represent potential targets for enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for better surveillance and management of HPAI infection in humans.">

        <tr id="Approximately four months after recovering from a mild COVID-19 infection, around 25% of individuals developed visuoconstructive deficit (VCD), which was found to be correlated with an increase in peripheral immune markers and alterations in structural and metabolic brain imaging. Recently, it has been demonstrated that supplemental vitamin B12 regulates hyperinflammation during moderate and severe COVID-19 through methyl-dependent epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, whole peripheral blood cultures were produced using samples obtained from patients with confirmed persistent VCD, and controls without impairment, between 10 and 16 months after mild COVID-19. This experimental model was used to assess the leukocyte expression patterns of 11 biomarkers previously associated with VCD in long COVID and explore the potential of pharmacological B12 in regulating these genes. The results showed that patients with persistent VCD displayed continued upregulation of CCL11 and LIF compared to controls. It is worth noting that elevated serum levels of CCL11 have been previously linked to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the addition of 1 nM of vitamin B12 to blood cultures from individuals with VCD normalized the mRNA levels of CCL11, upregulated the neuroprotective HGF, and, to a lesser extent, downregulated CSF2 and CXCL10. There was an inverse correlation observed between CCL11 mRNA levels and methylation levels of specific cytosines in its promoter region. These findings underscore the significance of systemic inflammation in persistent VCD associated with long COVID. Moreover, the study provides evidence suggesting that B12, acting as an epidrug, shows promise as a therapeutic approach for addressing this cognitive impairment.

        <tr id="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly evolved into a pandemic around the world. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the epidemiology and seasonality of other traditional respiratory viruses, e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, etc. These traditional respiratory viruses have transmission mode and clinical symptoms similar to SARS-CoV-2 but may differ in clinical outcomes and management. Co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature but have shown mixed evidence in clinical outcomes. With SARS-CoV-2 evolving into mild Omicron variants, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, which in turn affect the epidemiology and clinical course of respiratory viral infections. In response to these changes, multiplex molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and one or more traditional respiratory viruses are attracting more attention in the field and have been developed into a variety of testing modalities. In this review, we describe the seasonality (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), epidemiology, and clinical significance of traditional respiratory viruses and their co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the post-COVID era. Furthermore, we review commonly used multiplex molecular tests and their applications for the detection of respiratory viruses and their co-infections. Altogether, this review not only sheds light on the epidemiology and clinical significance of respiratory viral infections and co-infections in the post-COVID era, and but also provides insights into the laboratory-based diagnoses of respiratory viral infections using multiplex molecular testing.">

        <tr id="Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has varied presentations from asymptomatic to death. Efforts to identify factors responsible for differential COVID-19 severity include but are not limited to genome wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptomic analysis. More recently, variability in host epigenomic profiles have garnered attention, providing links to disease severity. However, whole epigenome analysis of the respiratory tract, the target tissue of SARS-CoV-2, remains ill-defined. Results We interrogated the nasal methylome to identify pathophysiologic drivers in COVID-19 severity through whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of nasal samples from COVID-19 positive individuals with severe and mild presentation of disease. We noted differential DNA methylation in intergenic regions and low methylated regions (LMRs), demonstrating the importance of distal regulatory elements in gene regulation in COVID-19 illness. Additionally, we demonstrated differential methylation of pathways implicated in immune cell recruitment and function, and the inflammatory response. We found significant hypermethylation of the FUT4 promoter implicating impaired neutrophil adhesion in severe disease. We also identified hypermethylation of ELF5 binding sites suggesting downregulation of ELF5 targets in the nasal cavity as a factor in COVID-19 phenotypic variability. Conclusions This study demonstrated DNA methylation as a marker of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with enhancer-like elements playing significant roles. It is difficult to discern whether this differential methylation is a predisposing factor to severe COVID-19, or if methylation differences occur in response to disease severity. These differences in the nasal methylome may contribute to disease severity, or conversely, the nasal immune system may respond to severe infection through differential immune cell recruitment and immune function, and through differential regulation of the inflammatory response.

        <tr id="The immune system’s response to an invading pathogen is the critical determinant in recovery from illness. Here, we hypothesize that the immune response will swiftly follow classical activation and a resolution trajectory in patients with the rapid evolution of symptoms if challenged by a viral pathogen for the first time. Alternatively, a dysregulated response will be signified by a protracted clinical trajectory. Consequently, we enrolled 106 patients during the first wave of COVID-19 and collected their blood within 24 h, 48 h, 7 days, and over 28 days from symptoms onset. The pathogenic burden was measured via serum levels of the S-spike protein and specific immunoglobulin titers against the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The nonspecific immunological response was gauged using interleukin 6, leukocytosis, and C-reactive protein. Coagulation status was assessed. Several serum biomarkers were used as surrogates of clinical outcomes. We identified four clusters depending on the onset of symptoms (immediate [A], 6 days [B], 12 days [C], and over 21 days [D]). High variability in the S-spike protein in cluster A was present. The corresponding immunoglobulin titer was random. Only procalcitonin differentiated clusters in terms of markers of nonspecific inflammation. Coagulation markers were not significantly different between clusters. Serum surrogates on cardiomyopathy and neuronal pathology exhibited significant variability. Implementation of ECMO or noninvasive ventilation was more prominent in cluster C and D. Interestingly, SOFA or APACHE II scores were not different between nominal (A and B) versus dysregulated clusters (C and D).">

Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor that is activated when pattern recognition receptors detect viruses. Upon activation, IRF3 induces the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) and interferon-stimulated genes, which protect the host from viral infection. However, coronaviruses antagonize this pathway, delaying type 1 IFN production. It is, therefore, unclear how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. Our prior reports showed that IRF3 promotes harmful inflammation during bacterial sepsis in mice. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that IRF3 cannot effectively control the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and instead promotes harmful inflammation during severe COVID-19. METHODS AND MODELS: We used mice transgenic for the human angiotensin converting-enzyme 2 transgene, driven by the keratin 18 promoter (K18-ACE2 mice) that were IRF3 deficient or IRF3 sufficient to test how IRF3 influences COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, K18-ACE2 mice showed a dose-dependent disease, characterized by mortality, lethargy, weight loss, and lung pathology, reminiscent of clinical COVID-19. However, K18-ACE2 mice lacking IRF3 were protected from severe disease with reduced mortality (84.6% vs. 100%) and disease score. We found that IRF3 promoted IFN-β production in the lungs and reprogrammed the cytokine profile, while viral load in the lungs was similar in the presence or absence of IRF3. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that IRF3 played a detrimental role in murine COVID-19 associated with changes in IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines.">

        <tr id="Chronic liver injury triggers the activation and recruitment of immune cells, causing antigen-independent tissue damage and liver disease progression. Tissue inflammation can reshape macrophage composition through monocyte replacement. Replacement of tissue macrophages with monocytes differentiating in an inflammatory environment can potentially imprint a phenotype that switches the liver from an immune-tolerant organ to one predisposed to tissue damage. We longitudinally sampled the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had active liver inflammation and were starting antiviral therapy. Antiviral therapy suppressed viral replication and liver inflammation, which coincided with decreased myeloid activation markers. Single-cell RNA-Seq mapped peripheral inflammatory markers to a monocyte-derived macrophage population, distinct from Kupffer cells, with an inflammatory transcriptional profile. The inflammatory macrophages (iMacs) differentiated from blood monocytes and were unique from macrophage found in healthy or cirrhotic liver. iMacs retained their core transcriptional signature after inflammation resolved, indicating inflammation-mediated remodeling of the macrophage population in the human liver that may affect progressive liver disease and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Excessive inflammation and cytokine release are hallmarks of severe COVID-19. Certain programmed cell death processes can drive inflammation, however, their role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is unclear. Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of regulated cell death initiated by inflammasomes and executed by the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Using an established mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus and a panel of gene-targeted mice we found that deletion of the inflammasome (NLRP1/3 and the adaptor ASC) and pore forming proteins involved in pyroptosis (GSDMA/C/D/E) only marginally reduced IL-1β levels and did not impact disease outcome or viral loads. Furthermore, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not trigger GSDMD activation in mouse lungs. Finally, we did not observe any difference between WT animals and mice with compound deficiencies in the pro-inflammatory initiator caspases (C1/11/12-/-). This indicates that the classical canonical and non-canonical pro-inflammatory caspases known to process and activate pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and GSDMD do not substantially contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. However, the loss of IL-1β, but not the absence of IL-18, ameliorated disease and enhanced survival in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals compared to wildtype mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that IL-1β is an important factor contributing to severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, but its release was largely independent of inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a global public health threat. Although no replication-competent virus has been found in breast milk samples, breastfeeding practices during the pandemic were impacted. It is well known that breast milk is adapted to meet the needs of infants, providing the appropriate amounts of nutrients and various bioactive compounds that contribute to the maturation of the immune system and antioxidant protection, safeguarding infants against diseases. While its composition is variable, breast milk contains immune cells, antibodies, and cytokines, which have anti-inflammatory, pro-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial properties that strengthen infant immunity. Since COVID-19 vaccines have not yet been approved for infants under six months of age, newborns rely on the passive transfer of antibodies via the placenta and breast milk to protect them against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several studies that analyzed breast milk samples in the context of COVID-19 have demonstrated that a strong antibody response is induced following maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of maternal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through natural infection and/or vaccination on the immunological composition of breast milk based on the studies conducted on this topic.">

        <tr id="Paediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) is characterised by abrupt onset obsessive compulsive disorder and regression in neurodevelopmental skills, triggered by infection or stress. Whether PANS is a distinct entity or part of a neurodevelopmental spectrum is uncertain, and its pathophysiology remains unclear. We show that children with PANS (n=32) and other non-PANS (n=68) neurodevelopmental disorders (total n=100) have higher reported early childhood infections and a loss of previously acquired developmental skills compared to neurotypical controls (n=58). Children with PANS have normal routine immune testing, however bulk RNA-sequencing (PANS n=20 vs controls n=15) revealed upregulated pathways in ribosomal biogenesis and RNA methyltransferases, and downregulated pathways in diverse cellular functions such as mitochondrial activity, cell signalling, endocytosis, and immune responses. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (PANS n=2 vs controls n=2) confirmed these findings but showed heterogeneity across immune cell types. Toll-like receptor stimulation assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed reduced TNF and interleukin-6 responses in PANS patients (n=7) compared to controls (n=7). RNA sequencing before and after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in PANS patients (n=9 vs controls n=10) revealed reversal of the dysregulated ribosomal, epigenetic, and cell signaling pathways. Given the central role of the immune system in synaptic pruning and neurodevelopment, these insights provide rationale for novel epigenetic and immune modulating therapies to optimize neurodevelopmental trajectories and minimize neuropsychiatric impairment.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial constituents of innate immunity, playing a vital role in the early defense against viral infections and cancer. Their antiviral capabilities stem from direct cytotoxic activity against infected cells and immunoregulatory functions that modulate adaptive immune responses. In the context of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), NK cells contribute to controlling viral replication and limiting excessive inflammatory responses.



 This review highlights the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity, focusing on their interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). We discuss potential sources of NK cells for adoptive transfer therapy, critical factors influencing their therapeutic efficacy, and considerations for clinical translation in COVID-19 treatment.



 Various NK cell sources for adoptive therapy are discussed, including peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetically engineered NK cells. Key factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NK cell-based therapies are analyzed, including cytokine modulation, NK cell subset selection, and delivery methods.



 Understanding the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity and the factors that influence the success of adoptive NK cell therapy can inform the design of more effective immunotherapies for COVID-19 patients. Strategies for improving NK cell function, such as genetic modification and optimizing therapy protocols, are highlighted to enhance therapeutic outcomes.



 NK cells neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by releasing cytotoxic granules, inhibiting replication, and modulating inflammation. They originate from peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetic engineering. Therapeutic strategies include adoptive transfer, cytokine modulation, and optimized delivery. Inflammation is controlled, reducing excessive immune responses.

        <tr id="Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of T cell maturation and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell function in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, which counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses. Methods Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and subjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune cell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell exhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell differentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were investigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived tumor organoids. Results MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively associated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It correlates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of immune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting their 3’ untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell promotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T cells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression and suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing ectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in mice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced with miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from the same patients. Conclusions MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ T cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could represent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering promising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.">

Deciphering the immune response in this population, particularly the role of cytokines underlying immunopathogenesis could elucidates the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Methods This prospective, two‐stage study enrolled 75 individuals with HIV diagnosed with COVID‐19 (case group) and 25 individuals from the general population infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 only (control group). COVID‐19 diagnosis followed World Health Organization guidelines. Plasma cytokine levels were measured using a cytokine bead array. Results The case group skewed slightly females (61.2% vs. 42.9% female in the control group) an average age of 3 years older (44.13 years vs. 40.86 years). Importantly, all the case group participants had mild complications, while a significant majority (88.1%) in the control group experienced severe complications. The control group displayed a substantially higher IgM titer 963 IU/mL compared to only 39.3 IU/mL in the case group. The control group had significantly higher levels of IL‐6, IL‐10, IFN‐γ, TNF‐α compared to the case group. Conclusion This study suggests a potentially distinct immune response in HIV‐positive patients when infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. Elucidating these differences could lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.">

        <tr id="Animal models are indispensable for unraveling the mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). This review evaluates recent research on PASC-related perturbations in animal models, drawing comparisons with clinical findings. Despite the limited number of studies on post-COVID conditions, particularly those extending beyond three months, these studies provide valuable insights. Three hallmark features of PASC—lung fibrosis, hyperglycemia, and neurological sequelae—have been successfully replicated in animal models, paving the way for mechanistic discoveries and future medical interventions. Although most studies have reported post-COVID conditions within 14–60 days post-infection, they still offer critical reference for future long-term research. This review also explores potential mechanisms of persisting immune misfiring, a key factor in the chronicity of PASC symptoms. Moreover, challenges in modeling PASC are also discussed, including the limited genetic diversity in inbred animal strains and difficulties in accurately identifying PASC-affected individuals. To address these issues, we propose methodological improvements, such as comparing individual animal parameters with control averages and incorporating genetically diverse populations like collaborative cross models. These strategies will enhance the identification and characterization of PASC endotypes in animal studies. By integrating findings from animal models with clinical manifestations of PASC, future research can provide more valuable insights into its mechanisms and support the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for longitudinal studies in animal models to fully uncover the mechanisms driving PASC and guide interventions to mitigate its public health impact.">

        <tr id="Long COVID has emerged as a significant challenge since the COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared as an outbreak in March 2020, marked by diverse symptoms and prolonged duration of disease. Defined by the WHO as symptoms persisting or emerging for at least two months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection without an alternative cause, its prevalence varies globally, with estimates of 10–20% in Europe, 7.3% in the USA, and 3.0% in the UK. The condition’s etiology remains unclear, involving factors, such as renin–angiotensin system overactivation, persistent viral reservoirs, immune dysregulation, and autoantibodies. Reactivated viruses, like EBV and HSV-6, alongside epigenetic alterations, exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy imbalance. Emerging evidence links SARS-CoV-2 to chromatin and gut microbiome changes, further influencing long-term health impacts. Diagnosis of long COVID requires detailed systemic evaluation through medical history and physical examination. Management is highly individualized, focusing mainly on the patient’s symptoms and affected systems. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating diverse perspectives to address systemic manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies. Enhanced understanding of long COVID’s pathophysiology and clinical features is critical to improving patient outcomes and quality of life. With a growing number of cases expected globally, advancing research and disseminating knowledge on long COVID remain vital for developing effective diagnostic and management frameworks, ultimately supporting better care for affected individuals.">

        <tr id="Long COVID-19 is characterized by the persistence of symptoms and immune alterations beyond the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the demographic, clinical, and immunological differences between individuals with and without long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This observational study included 206 participants, comprising 90 patients with long COVID-19 and 116 without. Data on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were collected, alongside immune cell profiles and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Statistical analyses compared these parameters between the two groups. Long COVID-19 patients were predominantly female (77.8%), older (47.78% aged 41–60, 20% >60 years), and had higher BMI, hypertension (31.1%), and autoimmune diseases (11.1%) compared to nonlong COVID-19 individuals (P < 0.001). Clinical symptoms unique to long COVID-19 included memory loss (40.0%), hair loss (37.8%), fatigue (35.6%), and myalgia/arthralgia (28.9%), all absent in the control group (P < 0.001). Immunologically, patients with long COVID-19 exhibited distinct immune profiles, including elevated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+), reduced B cells, and higher CD4/CD8 ratios. Moreover, long COVID-19 patients had higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, with 15.5% showing levels between 1000–2500 BAU/ml, compared to 6.9% in controls. These immunological biomarkers, including altered T cell subsets and antibody levels, highlight the complex immune dysregulation associated with long COVID-19. These findings could inform future clinical management and therapeutic strategies targeting immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Bats are reservoirs for multiple viruses, some of which are known to cause global disease outbreaks. Virus spillovers from bats have been implicated in zoonotic transmission. Some bat species can tolerate viral infections, such as infections with coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses, better than humans and with less clinical consequences. Bat species are speculated to have evolved alongside these viral pathogens, and adaptations within the bat immune system are considered to be associated with viral tolerance. Inflammation and cell death in response to zoonotic virus infections prime human immunopathology. Unlike humans, bats have evolved adaptations to mitigate virus infection-induced inflammation. Inflammatory cell death pathways such as necroptosis and pyroptosis are associated with immunopathology during virus infections, but their regulation in bats remains understudied. This review focuses on the regulation of inflammation and cell death pathways in bats. We also provide a perspective on the possible contribution of cell death-regulating proteins, such as caspases and gasdermins, in modulating tissue damage and inflammation in bats. Understanding the role of these adaptations in bat immune responses can provide valuable insights for managing future disease outbreaks, addressing human disease severity, and improving pandemic preparedness.">

        <tr id="Purpose of review Nonhuman primate (NHP) models of HIV-1 infection provide complementary experimental pathways for assessing aspects of acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) that cannot be addressed in humans. This article reviews acute infection studies in SIV-infected or SHIV-infected macaque species over the previous 18 months. Recent findings Reviewed studies examined the dynamics of replication-competent viral reservoir establishment during early infection, reservoir maintenance throughout therapy, and factors influencing viral rebound after treatment cessation. Also discussed are acute infection events in the central nervous system and liver and potential links between these events and manifestations of comorbidities during chronic infection. Additional studies addressed how occurrences during acute infection impact the development of natural viral control or posttreatment control. Another report evaluated treatment during acute infection with broadly neutralizing antibodies with enhanced ability to engage innate immune cells, highlighting the ability of this early intervention to shape innate and adaptive antiviral responses. Summary NHP models of HIV-1 infection are a fundamental research tool for investigating AHI events. These models enable detailed pathogenesis characterization and the testing of hypothesis-driven strategies for altering disease courses through interventions during AHI, including targeting viral persistence and comorbidities that persist throughout chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Since SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented changes in the epidemiology of other infectious diseases, investigations on coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and one of the famous vector-borne diseases, malaria, are crucial for disease control, especially in malaria-endemic areas. The clinical profiles, possible mechanisms for interactions, and representative control measures of COVID-19 and malaria coinfections have recently garnered public attention. The overlap in epidemiology, infection incubation, and clinical symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria coinfections has been thoroughly discussed to provide a detailed diagnostic procedure for coinfections, thereby guiding appropriate clinical interventions. Immunological and genetic evidence has shown that previous malaria exposure may protect the body from the poor prognosis of COVID-19. ACE2 downregulation and TLR-induced pathways play a role in this protective effect, as do CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell activation and coinhibitory receptor upregulation, which help maintain a balance of immune reactions. Finally, multiple control measures for coinfections were discussed, and malaria control efforts were enriched in the context of COVID-19. These efforts included (1) developing vaccinations; (2) evaluating the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in the SARS-CoV-2 treatment; (3) exploring recent advances in natural products that are potentially useful for coinfection treatment; (4) researching and implementing bioinsecticides for malaria control, such as gene-driven mosquitoes, fungi, and bacterial symbionts; and (5) improving national electronic disease surveillance platforms in malaria-endemic regions. At last, the above findings summarized valuable lessons about malaria and COVID-19 control and expedite further investigations on coinfections with complex clinical presentations.

        <tr id="Background: The coronavirus–caused disease (COVID-19), first identified in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide becoming a global pandemic. Although people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus presented mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in cardiovascular incidents was observed in several scientific studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response leading to a dysregulation of immune system function and massive production of inflammatory cytokines commonly known as “cytokine storm”. Methods: 57 patients eventually participated in the study, assigned to non–COVID (24 patients) and COVID (33 patients) groups. After signing consent to participate in the study, each patient was given a self–administered questionnaire to fill out prior to specimen collection, anthropometric measurements were taken and venous blood was collected for the following determinations: pro- and anti–inflammatory cytokines using a Bio–Plex 200 system, oxidative stress markers and basic hematological blood parameters. Results: showed statistically significant higher values of IL–1Ra and IL–1β in the COVID-19 group. Of the oxidative stress markers, only MDA levels were higher in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: the results of our study provide evidence and support the occurrence of elevated levels of IL–1Ra, IL–1β and MDA in the COVID-19 group of patients, which are associated with a worse course and prognosis of COVID-19.

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="La Crosse virus (LACV) is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in the U.S., primarily affecting children under 16 years. Despite severe morbidity and potential mortality risks, no vaccines or antivirals exist. Murine models recapitulate human susceptibility patterns, with weanling mice (3 weeks old) succumbing to disease while adults (≥8 weeks old) exhibit resistance. We characterized the T cell responses underlying this difference. Adult mice mounted robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by 6 days post-infection (dpi), with sustained IFN-γ, granzyme B, IL-2, and TNF-α production. These T cells expanded significantly and exhibited in vivo cytotoxicity against cells pulsed with LACV glycoprotein (Gc) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens. In contrast, weanlings showed weak T cell responses and 100% mortality by 7 dpi. Immunization with LFn-LACV-Gc and -N improved T cell cytotoxicity and survival in weanlings, highlighting their potential as vaccines. These findings inform strategies to mitigate LACV-induced encephalitis in children.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most patients recover fully after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2. Some, however, may develop pulmonary sequelae (PS) and/or long COVID (LC). However, whether these two clinical conditions have similar or different pathogenic mechanisms is unknown. Methods The levels of autoantibodies and 184 inflammatory and organ damage associated proteins in plasma were determined (by immunofluorescence and Olink panels, respectively) 1 year after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 51 patients with PS (DLCO < 80% ref), 31 patients with LC and 31 patients fully recovered (Rec). PS was defined by the presence of reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) lower than 80% ref. LC was defined by the presence of chronic symptoms in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Results We found that patients with PS or LC both showed increased levels than Rec of anti-microbial, immune cell activation and recruitment related proteins. Patients with PS showed higher levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies, whereas LC patients had increased levels of organ-damage associated proteins. In patients with PS most of the elevated proteins correlate with the impairment of lung function (DLCO). Finally, in PS we additionally performed the determinations at an earlier time point (6 months) and showed that the expression of CCL20 and IFN-ɣ was already higher at 6 months, while CCL3 and CCL19 increase from 6 to 12 months, suggesting a pathogenic role in PS persistence. Conclusions Patients with PS or LC have abnormal but different persistent circulatory immune and organ damage biomarkers, suggesting different underlying biology of both post-COVID conditions.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT SARS‐CoV‐2 is an oral pathogen that infects and replicates in mucosal and salivary epithelial cells, contributing to oral post‐acute sequelae COVID‐19 (PASC) and other oral and non‐oral pathologies. While pre‐existing inflammatory oral diseases provides a conducive environment for the virus, acute infection and persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 can also results in oral microbiome dysbiosis that further worsens poor oral mucosal health. Indeed, oral PASC includes periodontal diseases, dysgeusia, xerostomia, pharyngitis, oral keratoses, and pulpitis suggesting significant bacterial contributions to SARS‐CoV‐2 and oral tissue tropism. Dysbiotic microbiome‐induced inflammation can promote viral entry via angiotensin‐converting enzyme receptor‐2 (ACE2), serine transmembrane TMPRSS2 and possibly other non‐canonical pathways. Additionally, metabolites derived from a dysbiotic microbiome can alter the physiological and biochemical pathways related to the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. This may promote a pro‐inflammatory microenvironment, leading to immune exhaustion, loss of tolerance, and susceptibility to a variety of oral pathogens, causing acute and later chronic inflammation. Microbial release of mimics of host metallopeptidases related to furin, ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17), and glycoprotein metabolites can further aid viral attachment to T cell immunoglobulin‐like (TIMs), enhancing viral entry while simultaneously depressing oral mucosal immune resistance and clearance. Membrane reorganization characterised by neuroproteins, such as neuropilins, also functionally assists with SARS‐CoV‐2 entry and extends the pathogenesis of PASC from the oral cavity to the brain, gut, or other non‐oral tissues. Thus, poor oral health, characterised by disrupted oral microbiomes can promote viral tropism, weaken antiviral resistance, and heightens susceptibility to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This immune dysfunction also increases the risk of additional viral infections, exacerbating oral conditions like periodontal and endodontic diseases. These persistent oral health issues can contribute to systemic inflammation, creating bidirectional effects between oral and non‐oral tissues, potentially leading to Post‐Acute Sequelae of COVID‐19 (PASC).">

        <tr id="Cellular innate immune pathways are formidable barriers against viral invasion, creating an environment unfavorable for virus replication. Interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in driving and regulating these cell-intrinsic innate antiviral mechanisms through the action of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The host IFN response obstructs viral replication at every stage, prompting viruses to evolve various strategies to counteract or evade this response. Understanding the interplay between viral proteins and cell-intrinsic IFN-mediated immune mechanisms is essential for developing antiviral and anti-inflammatory strategies. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses, encode a range of proteins that, through shared and distinct mechanisms, inhibit IFN-mediated innate immune responses. Compounding the issue, a dysregulated early IFN response can lead to a hyper-inflammatory immune reaction later in the infection, resulting in severe disease. This review provides a brief overview of HCoV replication and a detailed account of its interaction with host cellular innate immune pathways regulated by IFN.">

Human bronchial epithelial cells serve as a viral replication target and source of the innate immune response to these viruses. To better understand the immune responses induced by RSV and HMPV in the pediatric airway epithelium, we comparatively studied pediatric and adult epithelial responses. We used normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells cultured in an air–liquid interface culture system (ALI), which helps to mimic the architecture of the human lower respiratory tract epithelium. Our results demonstrate differential viral replication patterns and reduced interferons; and inflammatory cytokines’ expression in pediatric cells compared to adult cells. However, pediatric epithelial cells expressed an increased mucus response and induced a stronger pro-inflammatory response in monocyte-derived dendritic cells. These findings reveal age-dependent immune epithelial responses that may contribute to more severe infections by HMPV and RSV.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence indicate that individual host immune response to pathogens may be as important as virulence factors in determining the severity of infection. However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology®™ software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NFκ-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response. Author Summery Infections often cause personal suffering, but also high economic costs. Brain infections such as bacterial or viral meningitis are particularly serious and carry a high risk of death or permanent disability. At the same time, resistance to anti-infective drugs is increasing and fewer new antibiotics are being developed. As a result, there is a great need for translational research to develop new treatments beyond conventional anti-infectives. Due to its strict compartmentalisation, the brain is well suited to identify specific pathogen-dependent, but also host (patient) dependent inflammatory patterns in infections. Using a cohort of patients with a defined group of pathogen-specific meningitis, we investigated the inflammatory patterns in the cerebrospinal fluid and were able to describe new specific pathogen-dependent and new host-dependent immune responses and identify associated signalling pathways. We were also able to show how and at what cellular and molecular level the blood-brain barrier is disrupted by infection. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier is an important aspect and has major implications for the course and prognosis of brain infections. Once the pathogen- and host-specific aspects of the immune response are understood, new personalised therapeutic approaches can be developed that directly target the regulation of the individual immune response.">

        <tr id="Despite effective HIV suppression, neuroinflammation and neurocognitive issues are prevalent in people with HIV (PWH) yet poorly understood. HIV infection alters the human virome, and virome perturbations have been linked to neurocognitive issues in people without HIV. Once thought to be sterile, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hosts a recently discovered virome, presenting an unexplored avenue for understanding brain and mental health in PWH. This cross-sectional study analyzed 85 CSF samples (74 from PWH on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, and 11 from controls without HIV, CWH) through shotgun metagenomics for DNA/RNA viruses. Taxonomic composition (reads and contigs), α and β diversity, and relative abundance (RA) of prokaryotic (PV), human eukaryotic (hEV), and non-human eukaryotic viruses (nhEV) were evaluated in relation to HIV infection, markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, cognitive functions, and depressive symptoms. Sensitivity analyses and post-hoc cluster analysis on the RA of viral groups and blood-brain barrier permeability were also performed. Of 46 read-positive CSF samples, 93.5% contained PV sequences, 47.8% hEV, and 45.6% nhEV. Alpha diversity was lower in PWH versus CWH, although p>0.05. At β diversity analysis, HIV status explained 3.3% of the variation in viral composition (p=0.016). Contigs retained 13 samples positive for 8 hEV, 2 nhEV, and 6 PV. Higher RA of PV was correlated with higher CSF S100β (p=0.002) and β-Amyloid 1-42 fragment (βA-42, p=0.026), while higher RA of nhEV with poorer cognitive performance (p=0.022). Conversely, higher RA of hEV correlated with better cognition (p=0.003) and lower βA-42 (p=0.012). Sensitivity analyses in virome-positive samples only confirmed these findings. Three CSF clusters were identified and showed differences in astrocytosis, βA-42, tau protein, and cognitive functions. Participants with hEV-enriched CSF showed better cognitive performance compared to those with virus-devoid and nhEV-enriched CSF (models’p<0.05). This study provides the first comprehensive description of the CSF virome in PWH, revealing associations with neuroinflammation and cognition. These findings highlight the potential involvement of the CSF virome in brain health and inform about its composition, origin, and potential clinical implications in people with and without HIV. Author Summary HIV can affect brain health and mental well-being, even in people on successful antiretroviral therapy. The reasons behind this are still unclear. HIV also influences the communities of microbes and viruses living in the human body, and recent research suggests that the human virome, the collection of all viruses within the body, may play a role in cognitive functions, mood, and brain health. For a long time, scientists believed that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which surrounds the brain, was sterile, while robust evidence has shown that the CSF hosts its own unique virome. Via advanced genetic sequencing (shotgun metagenomics), we analyzed the CSF virome in people with and without HIV looking for possible links to neuroinflammation, cognitive performance, and depression. We found that while HIV infection does affect the composition of CSF viral communities, there were no remarkable differences in the CSF virome of individuals with and without HIV. Most viral sequences appeared to come outside the brain. A higher abundance of non-human viral sequences, such as viruses of bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals, was associated with neuroinflammation and poorer cognitive performance. On the other hand, a higher abundance of human viruses correlated with better cognitive function and healthier signature of neuromarkers. These findings provide new insights into the presence and characteristics of the human CSF virome and how it might influence brain health. They also suggest new potential mechanisms of HIV-associated neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Background Ischemic stroke is characterized by a high incidence and elevated mortality. Ischemic events trigger neuroinflammation, leading to severe brain edema and neuronal necrosis. Microglia are the primary mediators of neuroinflammation. Inhibition of M1 microglia effectively alleviate neuronal damage in mild stroke. TPT-260 is a minimally cytotoxic, small molecule chaperone of the retromer complex, which mediates the recycling and trafficking of membrane protein receptors. This study explores the therapeutic effects and related mechanisms of TPT-260 in stroke model mice from an anti-inflammatory perspective, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of TPT-260 in treating stroke. Methods In this study, a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model was established to simulate ischemic stroke. Primary microglia were cultured for lipopolysaccharides treatment to construct M1 microglia. Both animals and cells were treated with TPT-260. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and the expression of downstream pro-inflammatory factors Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined. Results In vivo results revealed that TPT-260 significantly reduced the brain infarct area and inflammation as well as improved the neurological function of the stroke model mice. The potential mechanism of TPT-260 involved the marked inhibition of the lipopolysaccharides-induced M1 microglia by suppressing NF-κB nuclear translocation and attenuating the expression IL-1β and TNF-α. Moreover, TPT-260 inhibited NOD-like receptor protein 3 and reduced inflammasome formation, thereby decreasing the release of mature IL-1β and alleviating neuroinflammation. Conclusion TPT-260 attenuated M1 microglia via repression of NF-κB signaling, thus preventing neuroinflammation and neuronal injuries in stroke model mice.">

        <tr id="Severe infections such as malaria are on the rise worldwide, driven by both climate change and increasing drug resistance. It is therefore paramount that we better understand how the host responds to severe infection. Hematopoiesis is particularly of interest in this context because hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the turnover of all blood cells, including all immune cells. Severe infections have been widely acknowledged to affect HSPCs; however, this disruption has been mainly studied during the acute phase, and the process and level of HSPC recovery remain understudied. Using a self-resolving model of natural rodent malaria, infection by Plasmodium chabaudi, here we systematically assess phenotypically defined HSPCs’ acute response and recovery upon pathogen clearance. We demonstrate that during the acute phase of infection the most quiescent and functional stem cells are depleted, multipotent progenitor compartments are drastically enlarged, and oligopotent progenitors virtually disappear, underpinned by dramatic, population-specific and sometimes unexpected changes in proliferation rates. HSPC populations return to homeostatic size and proliferation rate again through specific patterns of recovery. Overall, our data demonstrate that HSPC populations adopt different responses to cope with severe infection and suggest that the ability to adjust proliferative capacity becomes more restricted as differentiation progresses.">

        <tr id="Increased body temperature, both locally and systemically, is a key feature of the inflammatory response. Heat is associated with increased blood flow to affected areas and increased immune infiltrate, yet increased temperature has also been described to have direct effects on immune cell function. In a recent study, Heintzman, et al investigated the effect of febrile temperature (39 °C) on T cell function. They describe increased TH1 function and fitness accompanied by a decrease in regulatory T cell suppressive function.

        <tr id="Aim: The objectives of our study were to evaluate a range of circulating biomarkers in COVID-19-related long-term neurological dysfunction.
Methods: The study involved 30 patients with post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and 28 patients after COVID-19 without PCS. The third cohort consisted of 29 patients with acute COVID-19 of varying severity. The severity of COVID-19 was classified as mild and moderate to severe. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and the SAGE test were used to study cognitive functions. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Sheehan Anxiety Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory were used to study affective functions. The levels of serum cytokines and IgM, IgG, IgA to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus were determined using the Vector-Best test systems (Novosibirsk, Russia). We also studied the IgG subclasses to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2.
Results: А mild to moderate COVID-19 infection primarily increases the risk of affective disorders and asthenia and, to a lesser extent, the development of cognitive impairment. The levels of IFN-α, IL-6, as well as serum antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 among patients with PCS were significantly higher compared to convalescents without PCS. IgM to the SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the blood of patients with PCS during 2–7 months after the disease. After moderate and severe COVID-19, IgG2 and IgG4 were predominant in the blood of patients with PCS and neurological symptoms. The levels of IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 in the blood serum of patients with PCS were higher after moderate and severe COVID-19 compared to patients who had mild COVID-19.
Conclusions: The obtained data on an elevated level of cytokines and IFN-α in the blood of PCS patients can suggest the hypothesis about the participation of chronic inflammation in neurological disorders. The main limitation of the study is the relatively small sample size, which limits the statistical analyses.">

        <tr id="Humoral immunity is orchestrated by follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which promote cognate B cells to produce high-affinity, protective antibodies. In aged individuals, humoral immunity after vaccination is diminished despite the presence of Tfh cells, suggesting defects after initial Tfh formation. In this study, we utilized both murine and human systems to investigate how aging alters Tfh cell differentiation after influenza vaccination. We found that young Tfh cells underwent progressive differentiation after influenza vaccination, culminating in clonal expansion of effector-like cells in both draining lymph nodes and blood. In aging, early stages of Tfh development occurred normally. However, aging rewired the later stages of development in Tfh cells, resulting in a transcriptional program reflective of cellular senescence, sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and metabolic reprogramming. We investigated the extent to which this rewiring of aged Tfh cells is due to the age-associated inflammatory ("inflammaging") microenvironment and found that this setting was sufficient to both block the transition of Tfh cells to a post-effector resting state and to skew Tfh cells towards the age-rewired state. Together, these data suggest that aging dampens humoral immunity by cytokine-mediated rewiring of late effector Tfh cell differentiation into an activated, yet less functional, cellular state.">

        <tr id="Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is often asymptomatically carried in the upper airways but can cause a wide spectrum of disease conditions, from local respiratory tract infections to invasive disease such as sepsis or meningitis. The factors driving NTHi’s transition from benign carriage to severe systemic disease remain poorly understood. It is unknown whether NTHi strains associated with invasive or non-invasive disease differ in their capacity to trigger inflammatory responses in innate immune cells. To address this question, we have used an in vitro infection model of human THP-1 cells differentiated to macrophages. To evaluate inflammatory responses, we studied the expression of 3 prototypic pro-inflammatory molecules, ICAM-1, TNF-α, and IL-1β. The role of lipooligosaccharide in triggering inflammatory responses was assessed using inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling. Our experiments demonstrated that NTHi strains isolated from cases of invasive and non-invasive infections were similarly able to induce strong activations of macrophage pro-inflammatory responses. Our findings support the hypothesis that the development of invasive versus non-invasive NTHi disease may be more significantly influenced by the adaptive immune response than the innate immune response.">

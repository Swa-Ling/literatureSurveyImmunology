        <tr id="Sustained smouldering, or low-grade activation, of myeloid cells is a common hallmark of several chronic neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis1. Distinct metabolic and mitochondrial features guide the activation and the diverse functional states of myeloid cells2. However, how these metabolic features act to perpetuate inflammation of the central nervous system is unclear. Here, using a multiomics approach, we identify a molecular signature that sustains the activation of microglia through mitochondrial complex I activity driving reverse electron transport and the production of reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, blocking complex I in pro-inflammatory microglia protects the central nervous system against neurotoxic damage and improves functional outcomes in an animal disease model in vivo. Complex I activity in microglia is a potential therapeutic target to foster neuroprotection in chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system3.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global health threat, yet our understanding of the dynamics of early cellular responses to this disease remains limited1. Here in our SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study, we used single-cell multi-omics profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs and blood to temporally resolve abortive, transient and sustained infections in seronegative individuals challenged with pre-Alpha SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses revealed rapid changes in cell-type proportions and dozens of highly dynamic cellular response states in epithelial and immune cells associated with specific time points and infection status. We observed that the interferon response in blood preceded the nasopharyngeal response. Moreover, nasopharyngeal immune infiltration occurred early in samples from individuals with only transient infection and later in samples from individuals with sustained infection. High expression of HLA-DQA2 before inoculation was associated with preventing sustained infection. Ciliated cells showed multiple immune responses and were most permissive for viral replication, whereas nasopharyngeal T cells and macrophages were infected non-productively. We resolved 54 T cell states, including acutely activated T cells that clonally expanded while carrying convergent SARS-CoV-2 motifs. Our new computational pipeline Cell2TCR identifies activated antigen-responding T cells based on a gene expression signature and clusters these into clonotype groups and motifs. Overall, our detailed time series data can serve as a Rosetta stone for epithelial and immune cell responses and reveals early dynamic responses associated with protection against infection.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Long coronavirus disease (COVID) is a heterogeneous clinical condition of uncertain etiology triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we used ultrasensitive approaches to profile the immune system and the plasma proteome in healthy convalescent individuals and individuals with long COVID, spanning geographically independent cohorts from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Symptomatic disease was not consistently associated with quantitative differences in immune cell lineage composition or antiviral T cell immunity. Healthy convalescent individuals nonetheless exhibited higher titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 than individuals with long COVID, and extensive phenotypic analyses revealed a subtle increase in the expression of some co-inhibitory receptors, most notably PD-1 and TIM-3, among SARS-CoV-2 nonspike-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with long COVID. We further identified a shared plasma biomarker signature of disease linking breathlessness with apoptotic inflammatory networks centered on various proteins, including CCL3, CD40, IKBKG, IL-18 and IRAK1, and dysregulated pathways associated with cell cycle progression, lung injury and platelet activation, which could potentially inform the diagnosis and treatment of long COVID.">

        <tr id="Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was repurposed to treat COVID-19 based on its in vitro antiviral effects. However, it was abandoned after multiple clinical trials reported a lack of efficacy. Immunomodulatory effects have been proposed but remain unclear, yet they may be relevant given IVM use for other infections. We assessed the IVM immunomodulatory effect in 24 participants from a clinical trial evaluating its potential to reduce COVID-19 transmission in mild cases within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM-treated patients showed non-significant lower viral loads, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We measured IgG, IgA, and IgM against five SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and 30 cytokines by Luminex, alongside whole blood RNA sequencing, pan-leukocyte immunophenotyping, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell analysis by flow cytometry from day 1 to day 28 post-treatment. All antibody responses increased from day 4, while 13 cytokines significantly decreased over time (adjusted p<0.05). IVM-treated patients had only significantly higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels at day 4 (adjusted p=0.041) and 7 (adjusted p=0.045) compared to placebo. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased over time, with significantly higher effector memory CD4+ T cells at day 7 compared to day 1 (p=0.027) and the only difference between groups was lower frequencies of spike-specific naïve CD4+ T cells at day 7 in IVM-treated participants (0.006% vs 0.036% p=0.02). Transcriptomic data showed downregulation of innate and antiviral blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) over time, with an increase in adaptive immune related BTMs. While no differential gene expression was detected, the IVM-treated had upregulated innate and downregulated T cell and cell cycle BTMs compared to placebo. Overall, our comprehensive longitudinal analysis of early immune responses in mild COVID-19 revealed no robust immunological effects of IVM, consistent with clinical trials results and suggesting a lack of efficacy of IVM in COVID-19 treatment. AUTHOR SUMMARY Ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug, was tested in clinical trials as a potential treatment for COVID-19 due to its in vitro antiviral properties and hypothetical immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory effects of IVM in a clinical trial involving 24 mild COVID-19 patients who received IVM within 48 hours of symptoms onset. The IVM group showed a trend towards lower viral loads post-treatment, and a significantly shorter duration of hyposmia/anosmia. We comprehensively analyzed immune responses by measuring antibody levels, cytokine profiles, immune cell subsets and whole blood gene expression over 28 days. The IVM group only had increased levels of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid compared to the control group. IVM did not affect the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 T cells, despite a slight decrease in naive CD4+ T cells. Additionally, gene expression analysis showed a decrease in innate and antiviral responses and an increase of adaptive responses over time that were slightly stronger in the placebo compared to the IVM group. In conclusion, despite some differences in IVM treated participants, our detailed analyses do not support significant immunomodulatory effects that could benefit disease progression.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the vulnerability of a globally connected population to zoonotic viruses. The FDA-approved coronavirus antiviral Paxlovid targets the essential SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro. Whilst effective in the acute phase of a COVID infection, Paxlovid cannot be used by all patients, can lead to viral recurrence, and does not protect against post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), commonly known as long COVID, an emerging significant health burden that remains poorly understood and untreated. Alternative antivirals that are addressing broader patient needs are urgently required. We here report our drug discovery efforts to target PLpro, a further essential coronaviral protease, for which we report a novel chemical scaffold that targets SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with low nanomolar activity, and which exhibits activity against PLpro of other pathogenic coronaviruses. Our lead compound shows excellent in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of severe acute disease. Importantly, our mouse model recapitulates long-term pathologies matching closely those seen in PASC patients. Our lead compound offers protection against a range of PASC symptoms in this model, prevents lung pathology and reduces brain dysfunction. This provides proof-of-principle that PLpro inhibition may have clinical relevance for PASC prevention and treatment going forward.">

        <tr id="Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. ZF2001, a protein subunit vaccine targeting the RBD, was utilized to evaluate its impact on the immune system of COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate peripheral cell profiles one year after three doses of ZF2001 vaccine using single cell mass spectrometry flow cytometry (CyTOF), a technique that allows detailed characterization of the immune response against SARS-COV-2 infection and further evaluation of ZF2001 mechanisms as a prophylactic against chronic disease and reducing mortality. Methods This study profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 vaccinated COVID-19 patients (Omicron 5.2) and 8 hDs using CyTOF with a 41-antibody panel. PBMCs isolated via Lymphoprep density gradient underwent metal-tagged antibody staining. Data analysis included FlowJo gating, Seurat/Harmony batch correction, PhenoGraph clustering (k=45), and t-SNE visualization. Statistical assessments employed Wilcoxon tests and Spearman correlation. Results Our findings revealed significant differences between infected and healthy individuals one year after three doses of ZF2001. Specifically, infected individuals exhibited: significant elevation of cytotoxic T cells expressing CD8 with a proliferation marker antigen-Kiel 67 (Ki67) and an adhesion molecule (CD138), expansion of B cells and reduction of monocytes expressing CD16, as well as depletion of CD4+ T cells and differentiation of T cells 1 year after the vaccine. These changes suggested that the vaccine was effectively modulating the immune response. Discussion Our results provided a detailed single-cell profile of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated patients, highlighting significant changes in immune cell kinetics indicative of an active innate and adaptive immune cell response.">

        <tr id="Objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a primary contributor to chronic functional impairment in human populations, initiating complex neuroinflammatory cascades and neurodegeneration. Despite extensive research efforts, the precise pathophysiological pathways remain incompletely characterized. This investigation aims to establish a novel therapeutic strategy that targets critical molecular pathways post-injury, potentially addressing the current limitations in the clinical management of TBI patients. Methods The single-cell data of cortical tissue from mice with TBI were obtained from public databases (GSE160763), which was utilized to identify alterations in in the composition of disease-associated cells and related molecules as the disease progresses. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional characteristics of microglia and astrocyte subpopulations. Trajectory analysis was employed to investigate cell differentiation characteristics. Subsequently, we examined the expression and function of microglia-specific molecules, such as IFI204, along with their underlying molecular mechanisms using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP), histopathology, behavioral tests, and molecular docking to assess binding status, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we used molecular docking technology to find small molecule compounds that IFI204 can stably bind to. Results We identified nine major cell populations, most of which undergo dynamic changes following TBI. Astrocytes and microglia were the predominant populations in each group, and further cluster analysis revealed that the proportions of interferon (IFN) and axonogenesis-related microglial subtypes increased after TBI. Trajectory inference analysis indicated that the expression of Ifi204 is upregulated in microglia during disease progression. Conditional microglial knockdown of IFI204 significantly improved neurological deficits in mice, and alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and microglial pyroptosis. Mechanistically, SENP7, identified as a novel molecule, interacts with IFI204 in microglia, catalyzes the deSUMOylation of IFI204, and promotes STING signal activation, ultimately driving microglial pyroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions The interaction between IFI204 and SENP7 promotes microglial pyroptosis and related mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, in the case of TBI, we hypothesize that targeting IFI204 might yield therapeutic benefits.

        <tr id="Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, can cause neurological symptoms, but the underlying neurotropic mechanisms are unclear. Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics. In summary, human astrocytes, but not neurons, contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, highlighting the potential benefits of ketamine treatment in coronavirus infections.">

        <tr id="Usutu virus (USUV) is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus capable of causing encephalitis in humans. Here, our main goal was to characterize the innate immune response in the brain during USUV encephalitis and to identify strategies to control disease severity. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of USUV encephalitis, we showed that microglia activation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory monocyte recruitment are hallmarks of disease 6 days post infection. Activated microglia were in close association to USUV-infected cells, concomitantly with elevated levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL1 in the brain. Monocyte recruitment was CCR2-dependent and driven by IFN-γ and CCL2 production beneath the brain vasculature. Moreover, CCR2 deficiency inhibited microglia activation and BBB disruption, showing the central role of CCR2 in USUV encephalitis. Accordingly, treatment with dexamethasone prevented pro-inflammatory mediator production and reduced leukocyte recruitment significantly, restraining encephalitis severity. Concluding, USUV encephalitis is driven by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment and BBB disruption, and blocked therapeutically by glucocorticoids.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is characterized by cytokine storm and organ dysfunction. The spike S1 subunit induces inflammatory cytokine production, but the immune cell subsets that respond to S1 stimulation and contribute to disease severity remain unclear. Methods We analyzed serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 (moderate: n = 7; severe: n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 38). Using mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), we analyzed immune cell responses to S1 subunit stimulation in PBMCs from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19. We examined correlations among identified cell populations, serum cytokine levels, and clinical parameters. Results Serum S1 subunit levels correlated with disease severity and inflammatory cytokine concentrations. S1 subunit stimulation induced dose-dependent cytokine production from PBMCs, predominantly from myeloid cells. CyTOF analysis identified classical monocytes with high CD147 expression (CD147hi cMono) as the primary source of S1-induced cytokines. The proportion of CD147hi cMono increased significantly in severe COVID-19 and decreased with clinical improvement. The frequency of CD147hi cMono showed a stronger positive correlation with clinical severity markers in younger patients compared to older patients. Conclusions CD147hi cMono are the primary cellular source of S1-induced inflammatory cytokines and may serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring COVID-19 severity and treatment response.

The causal mechanisms through which immune activation can drive depressive symptoms remain elusive, limiting the ability to develop new targeted therapies. Using a mouse model of neuroinflammation, involving a TLR7/8 agonist, we found central and systemic inflammation alongside anhedonia-like behaviours, altered thalamostriatal signalling and infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain. Here, we sought to use combined whole-brain transcriptome and spatial transcriptomics approaches to determine whether Aldara-driven neuroinflammation resulted in consistent immune and neurobiological changes throughout the brain. We found evidence of strong immune activation throughout the brain, with astrocytes displaying a strong inflammatory profile that was relatively uniform throughout. However, we found that this global inflammatory signal led to regionally-specific changes in gene expression, particularly reduced expression of genes associated with synaptic function in brain areas underlying mood and anxiety, such as ventral striatum and amygdala.

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health challenge. Severe cases often respond poorly to standard treatments, highlighting the necessity for novel therapeutic targets and early predictive biomarkers. Methods We utilized flow cytometry to analyze peripheral immune cells from healthy, bacterial pneumonia patients, and COVID-19 patients. The expansion of activated T cells (CD38+HLA-DR+), monocytes, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were detected and correlated with clinical outcomes to evaluate prognostic potential. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to characterize the critical cell subset associated with prognosis and elucidate its phenotype in COVID-19. Results We revealed a significant increase in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells in non-survivor COVID-19 patients, establishing them as an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality. The scRNA-seq analysis identified the CD38+HLA-DR+ T cell as a terminally differentiated, Treg-like subset exhibiting both activation and exhaustion characteristics. This subset presented the highest IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA levels among all T-cell subsets. Further functional analysis demonstrated its enhanced major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) cross-signaling and correspondingly enriched cytoskeletal rearrangement processes. In addition, there was dysregulated NAD+ metabolism in CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells via scRNA-seq, accompanied by elevated adenosine and decreased NAD+ levels in serums from COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We identified the selective expansion of CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells as a novel prognostic indicator for COVID-19 outcomes. These cells’ unique activated-exhausted phenotype, along with their impact on NAD+ metabolism, provides new insights into COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced impaired antiviral immunity and excessive inflammatory responses cause lethal pneumonia. However, the in vivo roles of key pattern recognition receptors that elicit protective antiviral and fatal inflammatory responses, specifically in the lungs, are not well described. Coronaviruses possess single-stranded RNA genome that activates TLR7/8 to induce an antiviral interferon (IFN) and robust inflammatory cytokine response. Here, using wild-type and TLR7-deficient (TLR7−/−) mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA-CoV-2), we examined the role of TLR7 in the lung antiviral and inflammatory response and severe pneumonia. We showed that TLR7 deficiency significantly increased lung virus loads and morbidity/mortality, which correlated with reduced levels of type I IFNs (Ifna/b), type III IFNs (Ifnl), and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the lungs. A detailed evaluation of MA-CoV-2-infected lungs revealed increased neutrophil accumulation and lung pathology in TLR7−/− mice. We further showed that blocking type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs and caused severe lung pathology, leading to 100% mortality compared to infected control mice. Moreover, immunohistochemical assessment of the lungs revealed increased numbers of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive macrophages, pneumocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells in TLR7−/− and IFNAR-deficient mice compared to control mice. In summary, we conclusively demonstrated that despite TLR7-induced robust lung inflammation, TLR7-induced IFN/ISG responses suppress lung virus replication and pathology and provide protection against SARS-CoV-2-induced fatal pneumonia. Additionally, given the similar disease outcomes in control, TLR7−/−, and IFNAR-deficient MA-CoV-2-infected mice and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, we propose that MA-CoV-2-infected mice constitute an excellent model for studying COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a delicate balance between a strong antiviral and an exuberant inflammatory response. A robust antiviral immunity and regulated inflammation are protective, while a weak antiviral response and excessive inflammation are detrimental. However, the key host immune sensors that elicit protective antiviral and inflammatory responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenge are poorly defined. Here, we examined the role of viral RNA-mediated TLR7 activation in the lung antiviral and inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. We demonstrate that TLR7 deficiency led to a high rate of morbidity and mortality, which correlated with an impaired antiviral interferon (IFN)-I/III response, enhanced lung virus replication, and severe lung pathology. Furthermore, we show that blocking IFN-I signaling using anti-IFN receptor antibody promoted SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs and caused severe disease. These results provide conclusive evidence that TLR7 and IFN-I receptor deficiencies lead to severe disease in mice, replicating clinical features observed in COVID-19 patients. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a delicate balance between a strong antiviral and an exuberant inflammatory response. A robust antiviral immunity and regulated inflammation are protective, while a weak antiviral response and excessive inflammation are detrimental. However, the key host immune sensors that elicit protective antiviral and inflammatory responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenge are poorly defined. Here, we examined the role of viral RNA-mediated TLR7 activation in the lung antiviral and inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. We demonstrate that TLR7 deficiency led to a high rate of morbidity and mortality, which correlated with an impaired antiviral interferon (IFN)-I/III response, enhanced lung virus replication, and severe lung pathology. Furthermore, we show that blocking IFN-I signaling using anti-IFN receptor antibody promoted SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs and caused severe disease. These results provide conclusive evidence that TLR7 and IFN-I receptor deficiencies lead to severe disease in mice, replicating clinical features observed in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Lipid droplets (LDs) are crucial for energy homeostasis, but are also involved in a wide spectrum of other cellular processes. Accumulating data identifies LDs as an important player in inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms and the impact of LDs on neuroinflammation remain unclear. Here, we describe a novel function of LDs in human astrocytes, in the context of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although, the overall lipid profile was unchanged in astrocytes with AD pathology, our data show a clear effect on LD metabolism and specific fatty acids involved in neuroinflammation. Importantly, we found astrocytes to be in close contact with infiltrating CD4 + T cells in the AD brain. Moreover, PLIN3 + LDs in astrocytes co-localize with major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII), indicating a role of LDs in adaptive immunity. Comprehensive analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes revealed that MHCII is in fact loaded within PLIN3 + LDs and forwarded to neighboring cells via tunneling nanotubes and secretion. Notably, the MHCII molecules are cleaved into its active form prior to packing, indicating an alternative route of MHCII shuttling through LDs, transporting functional immune complexes between cells. Quantification of PLIN3 + LDs in astrocytic cultures, human brain tissue and cerebral organoids indicates that AD pathology initially stimulates PLIN3 + LD formation, but in the long-run results in PLIN3 + LD consumption, which may have consequences on the astrocytes’ MHCII distribution capacity. Taken together, our findings present a novel function of PLIN3 + LDs that can be of relevance for AD and other inflammatory conditions.

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive, human-specific commensal infectious pathogen, poses a significant global health threat, especially in children under five, often resulting in fatalities. The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) remain elusive, necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single-cell resolution. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals. We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset, with significant relative increases in platelets, neutrophils, and their precursors, alongside relative decreases in natural killer (NK) cells, T cell subtypes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up-regulation of neutrophils-related immune genes across multiple immune cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells and B cells, suggesting excessive neutrophil activation. However, a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients. This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxity were down-regulated in both NK cells and T cells, alongside impaired T cell activation. Notably, distinct B cell subtypes, including unique naïve B cell clusters, demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM. The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.">

We reveal a link between sCD13 and amplified neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. sCD13 was markedly elevated in COVID-19 patients and correlated with disease severity, variants, ethnicity, inflammation markers, and NETosis. Neutrophils treated with sCD13 showed heightened NETosis and chemotaxis which were inhibited by sCD13 receptor blockade. Meanwhile sCD13 did not induce platelet aggregation. Single-cell analysis of COVID-19 lungs revealed co-expression of CD13 and MMP14 by various cell types, and higher CD13 expression compared to controls. Neutrophils with high CD13 mRNA were enriched for genes associated with immaturity, though CD13 protein expression was lower. Histological examination of COVID-19 lungs revealed CD13-positive leukocytes trapped in vessels with fibrin thrombi. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of B1R and a second sCD13 receptor, protease-activated receptor 4, on monocytes and neutrophils. These findings identify sCD13 as a potential instigator of COVID-19-associated NETosis, potentiating vascular stress and thromboembolic complications. The potent pro-inflammatory effects of sCD13 may contribute to severe COVID-19, suggesting that sCD13 and its receptors might be therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Differences in immune profiles of children and adults with COVID-19 have been previously described. However, no systematic studies have been reported from infants hospitalized with severe disease. We applied a multidimensional approach to decipher the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected infants (n = 26; 10 subacute, 11 moderate and 5 severe disease; median age = 1.6 months) and matched controls (n = 14; median age = 2 months). Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISGhi) state including: (i) CD14+ monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISGhi naive CD4+ T cells, (iii) ISGhi proliferating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and (iv) ISGhi naive and transitional B cells. We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.">

        <tr id="The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="The understanding of how the host immune response differs in T-cell phenotype and memory formation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients (LTRs) remains limited. LTRs who recovered from COVID-19 infection without prior vaccination represent a unique population for studying immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Six LTRs with positive neutralizing antibodies (nAb+) and six LTRs with negative nAb (nAb-) were included at 6 months following COVID-19 infection. It was found that nAb+ LTRs had higher anti-RBD IgG titers and greater neutralizing percent inhibition compared to nAb- LTRs. Fifteen T-cell subsets were identified in COVID-19 convalescent LTRs, and it was shown that only terminal effector CD8+ - 3 decreased in the nAb+ group, while elevated IL-10 expression levels were found in the nAb- group. After stimulation with the SARS-CoV-2 XBB spike peptide pool in vitro, it was observed that the nAb+ group exhibited an increase in effector memory CD4+ cells with lower PD-1 expression, a reduction in effector memory CD4+ - 2 cells, and terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells, while the nAb- group showed high expression of CTLA-4 and IL-10 in terminal effector CD8+ - 3 cells. Four SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell subsets were identified, with high expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in terminal effector CD8+ - 1 and terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in both groups. Perforin was mainly detected in terminal effector CD8+ - 2 cells in nAb+ LTRs. In addition to these proportional differences, stem cell memory CD4+ cells with higher IL-17A expression and stem cell memory CD8+ cells with higher CTLA-4 expression were also found in nAb- LTRs. These findings suggest that LTRs who developed nAb+ following SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit stronger T-cell responses, with more robust immune activation and memory recall, compared to nAb- LTRs. This study underscores the importance of understanding T-cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 recovery for guiding vaccination strategies and managing immunity in LTRs.">

        <tr id="Neuropsychiatric complications including depression and cognitive impairment develop, persist, and worsen in the years after traumatic brain injury (TBI), negatively affecting life and lifespan. Inflammatory responses mediated by microglia are associated with the transition from acute to chronic neuroinflammation after TBI. Moreover, type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling is a key mediator of inflammation during this transition. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the degree to which a microglia-specific knockout of the stimulator of interferons (STING) influenced TBI-induced neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. Here, microglial inducible STING knockout (CX₃CR1Cre/ERT2 x STINGfl/fl) mice were created and validated (mSTING−/−). Diffuse brain injury (midline fluid percussion) in male and female mice increased STING expression in microglia, promoted microglial morphological restructuring, and induced robust cortical inflammation and pathology 7 days post injury (dpi). These TBI-associated responses were attenuated in mSTING−/− mice. Increased cortical astrogliosis and rod-shaped microglia induced by TBI were independent of mSTING−/−. 7 dpi, TBI induced 237 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the cortex of functionally wildtype (STINGfl/fl) associated with STING, NF-κB, and Interferon Alpha signaling and 85% were attenuated by mSTING−/−. Components of neuronal injury including reduced NeuN expression, increased cortical lipofuscin, and increased neurofilament light chain in plasma were increased by TBI and dependent on mSTING. TBI-associated cognitive tasks (novel object recognition/location, NOR/NOL) at 7 dpi were dependent on mSTING. Notably, the TBI-induced cognitive deficits in NOR/NOL and increased cortical inflammation 7 dpi were unaffected in global interferon-α/β receptor 1 knockout (IFNAR1) mice. In the final study, the RNA profile of neurons after TBI in STINGfl/fl and mSTING−/− mice was assessed 7 dpi by single nucleus RNA-sequencing. There was a TBI-dependent suppression of cortical neuronal homeostasis with reductions in CREB signaling, synaptogenesis, and oxytocin signaling and increases in cilium assembly and PTEN signaling. Overall, mSTING−/− prevented 50% of TBI-induced DEGs in cortical neurons. Collectively, ablation of STING in microglia attenuates TBI-induced interferon responses, cortical inflammation, neuronal dysfunction, neuronal pathology, and cognitive impairment.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and resulting coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) cause placental dysfunction, which increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. While abnormal placental pathology resulting from COVID‐19 is common, direct infection of the placenta is rare. This suggests that pathophysiology associated with maternal COVID‐19, rather than direct placental infection, is responsible for placental dysfunction. We hypothesized that maternal circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), altered by COVID‐19 during pregnancy, contribute to placental dysfunction. To examine this hypothesis, we characterized circulating EVs from pregnancies complicated by COVID‐19 and tested their effects on trophoblast cell physiology in vitro. Trophoblast exposure to EVs isolated from patients with an active infection (AI), but not controls, altered key trophoblast functions including hormone production and invasion. Thus, circulating EVs from participants with an AI, both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, can disrupt vital trophoblast functions. EV cargo differed between participants with COVID‐19, depending on the gestational timing of infection, and Controls, which may contribute to the disruption of the placental transcriptome and morphology. Our findings show that COVID‐19 can have effects throughout pregnancy on circulating EVs, and circulating EVs are likely to participate in placental dysfunction induced by COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a severe complication of sepsis, affecting approximately 70% of patients, leading to increased mortality and long-term cognitive impairments among survivors. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the development of SAE, especially related to the cellular communication networks in the brain microenvironment. Methods: We evaluated the impact of myeloid cells on the brain's immune microenvironment through glial cell alterations using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data from human and mouse models and validated this with correlative experiments. We also developed the DeconvCellLink R package to study neuroinflammation-associated cellular interaction networks. A dynamic brain immune microenvironment map showing temporal alterations in brain cellular network during systemic inflammatory reactions was constructed using time-series data. Results: While brain cellular alterations differed between human and animal models, a highly conserved set of sepsis-associated genes regulating immune microenvironment signalling was identified. The dynamic alterations in cellular interaction networks and cytokines revealed brain immune cells' temporal response to systemic inflammation. We also found that valproic acid could mitigate sepsis-induced neuroinflammation by regulating glial cell balance and modulating the neuroimmune microenvironment. Conclusion: Through dynamic cellular communication networks, the study revealed that, immune dysregulation in the inflamed brain in SAE involves overactivation of innate immunity, with neutrophils playing a crucial role, providing a scientific framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies and offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced brain dysfunction.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths globally; however, the characterization of molecular biomarkers of severe disease remains of great scientific importance. The aim of this study was to capture the transcriptional differences of the whole blood gene expression between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe disease, using Next Generation Sequencing technologies, on admission and after 7 days. The genes which were differentially expressed in severe compared to mild patients were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Gene expression data were used to estimate the cell abundance of 22 immune cell types via digital cytometry. GO terms related to the response to molecules of bacterial origin, such as intestine-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were enriched, among other dysregulated pathways, which are well described as paramount mechanisms of severe manifestations of COVID-19. The neutrophil population increased in patients with severe disease, whereas the monocyte, CD8+ T cell, and activated Natural Killer (NK) cell populations were depleted. These cell population dynamics are also indicative of severe COVID-19 and intestinal bacterial translocation. This study elucidates the molecular basis of severe COVID-19 and highlights intestinal bacterial translocation as a potential driver of severe disease.">

        <tr id="Background Evobrutinib, a third-generation Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, shows great promise for treating neuroinflammatory diseases due to its small molecular size, ease of absorption, and ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Although previous studies have confirmed significant BTK expression in microglia, the potential of Evobrutinib to treat ischemic stroke by modulating microglial function and its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice with cerebral ischemia was established to evaluate the effects of oral Evobrutinib treatment. Assessments included TTC staining, behavioral experiments, and pathological examinations were used to evaluate cerebral ischemic injury. Western Blot, flow cytometry, and qPCR were employed to monitor changes in BTK and pBTK expression in microglia and the impact of Evobrutinib on neuroinflammation following the stroke. In vitro, primary microglia were generated to determine the effects of Evobrutinib on the TLR4/ Myd88/NF-κB pathway and on the polarization of microglial subtypes. Results The expression of BTK and pBTK is upregulated in microglia under conditions of cerebral ischemia and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). Evobrutinib treatment not only reduced infarct volume in mice but also ameliorated pathological damage and facilitated neurological function recovery. Flow cytometry revealed that Evobrutinib decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and promoted M2 microglia polarization post-stroke. In vitro studies demonstrated that Evobrutinib downregulated the proportion of pro-inflammatory microglia and curtailed the secretion of inflammatory factors under OGD conditions. Mechanistically, Evobrutinib attenuated the OGD-induced upregulation of TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB expression, an effect that was further enhanced by the addition of the TLR4 pathway inhibitor TAK242. Conclusions Evobrutinib inhibits the expression and activation of BTK in microglia, reducing M1 microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and alleviating ischemic injury following stroke. This effect is mechanistically linked to the inhibition of TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB-mediated M1 polarization of microglia. Graphical abstract Evobrutinib treatment improves neurological function of mice with cerebral ischemia, and alleviates neuroinflammation by inhibiting M1 microglia polarization through TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB pathway.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite over 13 billion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses administered globally, persistent post-vaccination symptoms, termed post-COVID-19 vaccine syndrome (PCVS), resemble post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Symptoms like cardiac, vascular, and neurological issues often emerge shortly after vaccination and persist for months to years, mirroring PASC. We previously showed the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein persists in CD16+ monocytes after infection, potentially driving PASC. Approved vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, AstraZeneca) deliver synthetic S1 to elicit immunity, suggesting a shared mechanism. We hypothesized that vaccine-derived S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes sustains inflammation akin to PASC, contributing to PCVS. We studied 50 individuals with PCVS symptoms lasting over 30 days post-vaccination and 26 asymptomatic controls, using (1) machine learning-based immune profiling to compare cytokine signatures with PASC, (2) flow cytometry to detect S1 in CD16+ monocytes, and (3) LC-MS to confirm S1 across vaccine types. We correlated S1 persistence with symptom duration and inflammation. Prior infection was excluded via clinical history, anti-nucleocapsid antibody tests, and T-detect assays, though definitive tests are lacking. Preliminary findings suggest S1 persistence in CD16+ monocytes and an associated inflammatory profile may contribute to PCVS. Further studies are needed to confirm causality and prevalence.">

        <tr id="Background Despite the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in reducing mortality and severe cases of COVID-19, a proportion of survivors experience long-term symptoms, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). This study investigates the long-term immunological and neurodegenerative effects associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) in COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods 13 Controls and 20 COVID-19 survivors, 15 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, were recruited. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in both plasma and EVs. A deep-immunophenotyping of monocytes, T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) was performed, along with immunostainings of SARS-CoV-2 in the colon. Results Higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurofilaments were found in EVs but not in plasma from COVID-19 survivors. Additionally, COVID-19 participants exhibited altered monocyte activation markers and elevated cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Increased activation markers in CD4+ T-cells and decreased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression in DCs were observed in COVID-19 participants. Furthermore, the amount of plasmacytoid DCs expressing β7-integrin were higher in COVID-19, potentially associated with the viral persistence observed in the colon. Conclusions COVID-19 survivors exhibit long-term immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring of PASC. The cargo of EVs can be a promising tool for early detection of virus-induced neurological disorders.">

        <tr id="Rationale: One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) may be a risk factor for the neuropathology linked to amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation. However, the mechanisms underlying HSV1-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in AD remain unclear. ALT001 is a novel drug that ameliorates AD-related cognitive impairment via ULK1/Rab9-mediated alternative mitophagy. In this study, we investigated the effects of ALT001 on the neurodegeneration-related microglial signatures associated with HSV1 infection. Methods: Molecular mechanisms and physiological functions of mitophagy was investigated in HSV1-infected microglia, including primary murine and human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived microglia (ES-MG), as well as in a microglia-neuron co-culture system. Microglial gene signatures following HSV1 infection in the presence or absence of ALT001 were analyzed using bulk RNA sequencing, and the effects of ALT001 on microglial phagocytosis and microglia-mediated immune responses were further evaluated by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles. Results: HSV1 infection inhibited PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy via HSV1-encoded protein kinase US3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction in both human and mouse microglia. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of HSV1-infected microglia revealed an upregulation of distinct microglial genes associated with disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like phenotype and pro-inflammatory activity. Pharmacological targeting of mitophagy using ALT001 prevents mitochondrial damage caused by HSV1 through ULK1/Rab9-mediated pathway. Furthermore, ALT001-induced ULK1/Rab9-dependent mitophagy restricts HSV1 infection by activating interferon-mediated antiviral immunity. Consequently, ALT001 reduces HSV1-triggered neuroinflammation, recovers HSV1-altered microglial phagocytosis for Aβ, and efficiently reverses morphological and molecular abnormalities in HSV1-infected microglia by triggering mitophagy in ES-MG. ALT001 also suppressed HSV1-mediated Aβ accumulation and neurodegeneration in the microglia-neuron co-culture and cerebral organoid model. Conclusions: In this study, we identified a critical molecular link between HSV1 and AD-related microglial dysfunction. Furthermore, our findings provide an evidence that therapeutic targeting of alternative mitophagy via ALT001 effectively interfere with HSV1-induced microglial dysfunction and alleviate neurodegeneration.">

        <tr id="The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung has been extensively studied, yet the molecular regulators of host-cell programs hijacked by the virus in distinct human airway epithelial cell populations remain poorly understood. Some of the reasons include overreliance on transcriptomic profiling and use of nonprimary cell systems. Here we report a network-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomic profiles able to identify master regulator (MR) proteins controlling SARS-CoV-2–mediated reprogramming in pathophysiologically relevant human ciliated, secretory, and basal cells. This underscored chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathways, as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR assays as components of the viral-host response in these cells. Large-scale drug perturbation screens revealed 11 candidate drugs able to invert the entire MR signature activated by SARS-CoV-2. Leveraging MR analysis and perturbational profiles of human primary cells represents an innovative approach to investigate pathogen-host interactions in multiple airway conditions for drug prioritization.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the diminishing global impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus continues to circulate and undergo mutations, posing ongoing challenges for public health. A comprehensive understanding of virus entry mechanisms is crucial for managing new epidemic strains. However, the cellular processes post-endocytosis remain largely unexplored. This study employs proximity labeling to examine proteins near ACE2 post-viral infection and identified syntaxin-6 (STX6) as a factor that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by impeding the endocytic release of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances early endosome recruitment of STX6. STX6 appears to hinder the maturation of viral particles-laden early endosomes into late endosomes, from which the virus could escape. Instead, it promotes the trafficking of the virus toward the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. STX6 exhibits a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 variants and several other viruses that enter via endocytosis. We report for the first time the function of STX6 as a restrictive factor in viral infection. IMPORTANCE Virus entry is the first step of the virus life cycle, and the exploitation of the endo-lysosome pathway for cellular entry by viruses has been well documented. Meanwhile, the intrinsic defense present within cells interferes with virus entry. We identified STX6 as a host restriction factor for viral entry by facilitating the virus trafficking to the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway. Notably, STX6 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants and other viruses employing endocytosis for entry.

        <tr id="Pathogen-induced septic death presents a substantial public health challenge, with its neuroimmune mechanisms largely unexplored. Our study investigates neurotransmitter modulation of ACOD1 expression, a regulator of immunometabolism activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Screening neurotransmitters identifies dopamine as a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced ACOD1 expression in innate immune cells. Mechanistically, DRD2 forms a complex with TLR4, initiating MAPK3-dependent CREB1 phosphorylation and subsequent ACOD1 transcription. Conversely, dopamine disrupts TLR4-MYD88 interaction via DRD2 without affecting the formation of the LPS-induced TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex. Enhanced ACOD1 expression induces CD274/PD-L1 production independently of itaconate, precipitating inflammation-associated immunosuppression in sepsis. Delayed administration of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, mitigates lethality in bacterial sepsis mouse models. Conversely, the dopamine antagonist aripiprazole exacerbates sepsis mortality. Dysregulation of the dopamine-ACOD1 axis correlates with sepsis severity in patients, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this neuroimmune pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease acquired through tick bites. We have previously demonstrated the correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. In the current study, our clinical observation study establishes a strong correlation between elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA and poor prognosis. In vivo studies further reveal endothelial cells as an important source responsible for releasing mtDNA into circulation, which promotes B cell activation, migration, and differentiation via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Notably, TLR9 activation enhances B-cell susceptibility to SFTSV infection. These findings suggest that mtDNA released by injured endothelial cells facilitates B cell differentiation and virus replication, emphasizing the significant role of mitochondrial damage within endothelial cells in contributing to the severity of SFTS outcomes. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a new acute tick-borne infectious disease with a high fatality rate of 10%–50%. There is a strong correlation between SFTSV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation induction, disease progression, and fatal outcome. Our research has revealed the crucial role of mtDNA in predicting the prognosis of SFTS and its impact on vascular endothelial injuries as well as B cell differentiation, two previously unexplored features of SFTSV infection. Moreover, mtDNA could activate the TLR9 signal to induce plasmablast differentiation in B cells and promote SFTSV infection. This study provides valuable mechanistic and clinical insights into the adverse outcomes associated with SFTSV infection.

        <tr id="Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron has demonstrated decreased pathogenicity, yet a few individuals suffer severe pneumonia from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection; the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods The present work investigated the role of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the occurrence and progression of severe Omicron infection. The expression and dynamic changes of ISGs were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the anti-ISG15 autoantibody in infected patients was detected by ELISA. Moreover, we evaluated the correlation of ISGs with disease severity and outcomes by comparing expression of ISGs among each group. Results Decreased expression of several ISGs such as IFI6 are potentially linked to increased severity or poor outcomes of Omicron infection. Longitudinal data also demonstrates that the dynamic variation of IFI6 in the Omicron infection phase may be linked to the prognosis of the disease. The increase of anti-ISG15 autoantibody potentially links to the disease progression and poor outcome of patients with high level of ISG15 expression. Conclusions These findings define aberrant Interferon-stimulated gene associated host responses and reveal potential mechanisms and therapeutic targets for Omicron or other viral infection.">

Although vaccination efforts have effectively reduced mortality and transmission rates, a significant proportion of recovered patients—up to 40%—develop long COVID syndrome (LC) or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection (PASC). LC is characterized by the persistence or emergence of new symptoms following initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting the cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune systems. Despite the broad range of clinical symptoms that have been described, the risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms behind LC remain unclear.

        <tr id="Microglia continuously monitor neuronal health through somatic purinergic junctions, where microglial processes establish dynamic contacts with neuronal cell bodies. The P2Y12 receptor is a key component of these junctions, essential for intercellular communication between ramified microglia and neurons under homeostatic conditions. While P2Y12 has long been considered a marker of homeostatic microglia, its potential role in reactive microglia during neurodegenerative disease remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that P2Y12 deletion significantly reduces microglia-neuron process-to-body contacts in adult mice, consistent with previous findings. However, unexpectedly, P2Y12 loss markedly increases microglia-neuron body-to-body contacts, revealing an alternative mode of microglia-neuron communication independent of P2Y12. In prion-infected mice, P2Y12 expression persists in reactive, amoeboid microglia during advanced disease stages, including those engaging in extensive neuronal envelopment. Notably, P2Y12 loss increases the prevalence of envelopment events and accelerates disease progression. These findings redefine the role of P2Y12 in neurodegeneration, suggesting that its progressive decline lowers the threshold for microglia-neuron body-to-body interactions, ultimately influencing disease trajectory.">

In this study, we evaluated whether Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), a serum marker of lung alveolar cell damage, is predictive for disease severity. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. Serum levels of Clara cell 16 kDa protein (CC16), soluble Fas Ligand, cytochrome C, thymus- and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) and of oxidate stress related proteins were analyzed. Clinical patient data were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. COVID-19 positive patients were divided in two groups according to disease severity. The mean day difference between COVID-19 diagnosis date and sampling date was +11 days. Concentrations of TARC were lower in COVID-19 positive versus COVID-19 negative patients (unpaired t-test, p=0.002). In addition, CC16 serum levels were significantly elevated in sera taken from patients that were admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) (p=0.0082). In a matched cohort, sera taken prior to ICU admission (-3 days) contained higher CC16 levels (paired t-test, p=0.0072). Multivariable analyses adjusted for known risk factors (age, gender, blood counts, lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, underlying disease) showed that CC16 levels were independently associated to COVID-19 severity (interquartile-range, odds ratio 1.53, p=0.0102). In conclusion, our findings highlight CC16 as a promising biomarker for early identification of severe COVID19 cases, which could improve patient management and resource allocation.">

        <tr id="Background: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection results in persistent liver inflammation, which ultimately leads to liver fibrosis and increases the risk of cirrhosis. Recruitment of circulating monocytes to the liver is an essential aspect that exacerbates liver fibrosis; however, the mechanism underlying their dysregulation, which contributes to this progression, remains unclear. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to characterize the landscape of circulating monocytes from patients with CHB and liver fibrosis (CHB group) and healthy controls (HC group). Conventional techniques were performed to validate the findings. Results: Monocytes significantly expanded in the CHB group. The proto-oncogene LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) was highly expressed in monocytes from the CHB group, which may be associated with their expansion. In addition, we noticed that a classical monocyte subcluster surged in the CHB group and highly expressed platelet-related genes such as ITGA2B, which was identified as monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPA). The frequency of MPA was significantly higher in the CHB group, positively associated with platelet and white blood cell, and negatively associated with liver fibroscan and age, which indicates that MPA may play an important role in liver inflammation in the early liver fibrosis stage. Moreover, we found that MPA displays the enrichment of chemokine signaling-associated genes, such as C-C chemokine motif ligand 5 (CCL5﻿), and showed an increased adhesion capacity to endothelial cells. After incubation with MPA cell supernatants, pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-8 and IL-1β were upregulated in LX-2 cells, which were reversed by the addition of anti-CCL5 antibodies. Conclusions: Our data suggest that enhanced LMO2﻿﻿﻿ expression in circulating monocytes may be associated with their expansion, and an increased MPA subset may participate in liver fibrosis progression. These results provide valuable insights into the etiology of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Bioaerosol-mediated transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via building ventilation systems has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. We used the South African Airborne Infections Research (AIR) facility near Pretoria to study human-to-animal (H2A) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in newly diagnosed patients. While the facility was built to study tuberculosis transmission, this was its first adaptation to study H2A virus transmission. Methods Patients with clinically confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 were housed for up to 4 days in in the AIR facility with continuously exhausting patient ward air to hamsters housed in animal exposure rooms. After a 3-week exposure period, animals were held for an additional week to allow for antibody development. Animal sera were analyzed for anti-spike and plaque reduction activities and lung samples for pathology. Results Seven patients provided ≥400 in-residence hours over a 17-day period. Pair-housed naive golden Syrian hamsters (n = 216) received continuous exposure to mixed patient ward exhaust. Serum analyses revealed anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in 58% of animals tested. Plaque reduction assays on 7 high-titer serum samples revealed neutralizing activity. Conclusions These results support the concept that viral bioaerosols generated from patients remain infectious over long-distance transport through a building ventilation system. The seroconversion among sentinel animals supports the long-held belief that airborne infections manifest as a stochastic rather than deterministic event that is subject to a threshold dose effect. Further confirmatory studies are necessary to characterize the relationship between the bioaerosol delivered and the infections that result in this controlled H2A transmission model.">

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability, with reperfusion injury contributing significantly to poor clinical outcomes. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, play a dual role in ischemic stroke by both exacerbating injury through neuroinflammation and supporting recovery through neuroprotection. This study aimed to explore the role of CD74, a gene upregulated in microglia following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing, we identified CD74 as a potential target involved in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation. We observed a significant increase in CD74 expression in microglia following middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R), which correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine production and neuroinflammation. Targeted knockdown of CD74 in microglia using CX3CR1Cre/ERT2 mice led to a reduction in infarct volume, inflammatory cytokine levels, and long-term neurological deficits. Behavioral tests showed improved motor coordination, sensory function, and exploratory behavior in CD74 knockdown mice. These results suggest that CD74 is a critical mediator of microglia-driven neuroinflammation, and targeting CD74 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing ischemic brain injury and promoting recovery after stroke.

        <tr id="Preterm sepsis is a major contributor to brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, but its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study integrated clinical and experimental approaches to investigate the pathological changes linking systemic inflammation to brain injury in preterm infants. Transcriptomic analysis of septic preterm infants’ peripheral blood revealed upregulated immune, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways, suggesting a link between systemic and brain inflammation. Using P2 mice, we established a preterm white matter injury model through multiple doses of lipopolysaccharide, observing dose-dependent developmental delays, brain inflammation, and long-term behavioral deficits. Integrative analyses of peripheral blood and brain samples from both mice and preterm infants revealed consistent chemokine alterations and immune cell infiltration across peripheral and central compartments, highlighting the significant involvement of neutrophil extracellular traps in preterm brain injury. Furthermore, microglia exhibited significant transcriptional changes during the acute phase, accompanied by metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, with suggested involvement of Pgk1 and Pgam1. This shift intensified with escalating inflammation, along with PANoptosis-related gene upregulation, ultimately associated with microglial cell death. Collectively, these findings provide pathological insights into the immunometabolic alterations underlying sepsis-induced preterm brain injury and suggest potential targets for future therapeutic interventions to mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental deficits.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, yet the interplay between peripheral and central immune responses is still only partially understood. Emerging evidence suggests that myeloid cells, when activated in the periphery, infiltrate the ischemic brain and contribute to the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through both inflammatory and metabolic mechanisms.


METHODS
In this study, we integrated bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and flow cytometry data from human and mouse models of ischemic stroke. Mouse stroke models were induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), and brain tissues were later collected at specified time points for analysis. We examined time-dependent transcriptional changes in the peripheral blood, delineated cell-type-specific responses by single-cell profiling, and validated myeloid infiltration into the ischemic brain. We also investigated endothelial metabolic reprogramming and oxidative stress by combining scMetabolism analyses (a computational R package for inferring metabolic pathway activity at the single-cell level) with in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) experiments.


RESULTS
Cross-species bulk RNA-seq revealed a modest early immune shift at 3 h post-stroke, escalating significantly by 24 h, with robust myeloid-centric gene signatures conserved in humans and mice. Single-cell analyses confirmed a pronounced expansion of neutrophils, monocytes, and megakaryocytes in peripheral blood, coupled with a decrease in T and B lymphocytes. Spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry demonstrated substantial infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid cells into the infarct core, which showed extensive interaction with endothelial cells. Endothelial scRNA-seq data showed reductions in the oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione, and nicotinate metabolic pathways, together with elevated pentose phosphate pathway activity, suggestive of oxidative stress and compromised antioxidant capacity. Functional scoring further indicated diminished endothelial inflammation/repair potential, while in vitro OGD/R experiments revealed morphological disruption, CD31 downregulation, and increased 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), underscoring the importance of endothelial oxidative damage in BBB breakdown.


CONCLUSIONS
These multi-omics findings highlight the existence of a coordinated peripheral-central immune axis in ischemic stroke, wherein myeloid cell recruitment and endothelial metabolic vulnerability jointly exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress.

        <tr id="Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection leads to viral encephalitis and neurological damage in mice, causing significant neurological symptoms and brain damage. This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms of PRV-induced encephalopathy and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We found that PRV infection increased the number of astrocytes and induced a phenotypic shift from the A2 to the A1 subtype, which was associated with increased secretion of MMP-9. MMP-9 was identified as a critical mediator of PRV-induced BBB disruption, as it degrades collagen VI, leading to BBB damage. PRV was shown to penetrate the BBB via a paracellular pathway, and MMP-9 deletion reversed this damage, mitigating tight junction injury. Additionally, PRV infection caused an “inflammatory storm” in the central nervous system (CNS), with increased levels of the chemokines CCL-3, CCL-4, and CCL-5; the cytokines IL-6 and IL-18; and TNF-α. The expression of INF-γ was significantly decreased. In conclusion, PRV infection disrupts the BBB and induces an inflammatory response in the CNS, with MMP-9 playing a key role in mediating BBB damage. These findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of PRV-induced encephalopathy and potential therapeutic targets for viral encephalitis.">

        <tr id="Background Long-COVID immunopathogenesis involves diverse factors. We longitudinally characterize hospitalized COVID-19 patients, examining the role of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and inflammation in immune dysregulation. Methods Hospitalized patients are evaluated during acute infection (T0), 3 months post-symptom onset (T1), and 3 years if symptoms persisted (T2). Immune profile includes characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-specific T/B cells (flow cytometry) and antibodies (ELISA, neutralization, ADCC). RNAemia and cytokines are quantified (RT-PCR, cytometric beads array) and correlated. Statistics: non-parametric cross-sectional, longitudinal and correlation analyses. Results Here we show 48 hospitalized individuals during acute COVID-19, 38 exhibit early persistent symptoms (EPS+) 3 months post-symptoms onset, 10 do not (EPS−). Groups are comparable for age, sex, co-morbidities. The EPS+ shows fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia/dysgeusia, diarrhea, chronic pain, mnestic disorders. Over time, they show a reduction of neutralization ability and total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells, with increased total CD4 TEMRA, and failure to increase RBD-specific B cells and IgA+ MBCs. EPS+ patients show higher levels of T0-IFN-γ + CD4 TEMRA, T1-IL-2 + CD4 TEM and T1-TNF-α + CD4 cTfh. In EPS+, baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia positively correlates with CD4 TEMRA, follow-up SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with ADCC. Among 38 EPS+ individuals at T1, 33 are evaluated 3 years after infection, 5 are lost at follow-up. 10/33 EPS+ show long-term symptoms (late persistent symptoms, EPS + LPS+), whereas 23/33 fully recover (EPS + LPS−). Antibodies, RNAemia, and cytokines show no differences between/within groups at any time point. Conclusions Early persistent symptoms are associated with multi-layered SARS-CoV-2-specific/non-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune dysregulation. The shift towards non-Ag-specific TEMRA and ADCC trigger in EPS+ may relate to SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Early immune dysregulation does not associate with long-term persistent symptoms. Further research on SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and early immune dysregulation is needed.">

        <tr id="Infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 results in mild to severe COVID‐19 disease courses. Several studies showed the association of impaired T‐cell responses and certain HLA haplotypes with disease severity. However, it remained unclear if T‐cell activation was compromised due to a general reduction of presented epitopes or other intrinsic factors within APCs or T cells. Furthermore, a potential reduction of presented epitopes would suggest if an upcoming SARS‐CoV‐2 variant could escape T‐cell immunity. Hence, knowledge about the T‐cell epitope landscape of SARS‐CoV‐2 would allow to better understand mechanisms leading to severe disease and to estimate the potential stability of the T‐cell response in light of virus evolution, which might provide insights for future vaccine designs. Hence, in the present study, the T‐cell epitope landscape of SARS‐CoV‐2 was determined via in vitro T‐cell stimulation plus in silico prediction. HLAs associated with mild and severe disease courses showed almost the same potential in epitope presentation, suggesting intrinsic factors of APCs or T cells as contributors to the more severe disease courses. As T‐cell epitopes did also not originate from regions of SARS‐CoV‐2 having shown high mutation rates in the past, a relatively stable T‐cell response can be expected regarding new SARS‐CoV‐2 strains in the future. Analysis of the T‐cell epitope landscape of SARS‐CoV‐2 suggests T‐cell intrinsic factors as likely modulators of disease severity and that the capacity of MHC‐peptide presentation remains stable among circulating SARS‐CoV‐2 viral strains.">

        <tr id="Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae (PASC). However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts the brain and leads to persistent behavioral changes remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces neuroinflammation and microglial activation, leading to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice. Methods: We established a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model using the virulent SARS2-N501YMA30 strain to investigate its impact on the central nervous system (CNS). We assessed neuroinvasion via immunostaining of dsRNA and markers for neuronal, astrocyte, and microglia in brain slices. Behavioral changes were evaluated at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 4 months post-infection. Molecular and cellular analyses included bulk RNA-seq, Golgi-Cox staining, field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess gene expression, neuronal morphology, and microglial activation in the brain. Results: We demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501YMA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral assays indicated a marked elevation in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors post-infection. A comparative analysis of RNA expression profiles disclosed alterations in the post-infected brains. Additionally, we observed dendritic spine remodeling on neurons within the amygdala after infection. Infection with SARS2-N501YMA30 was associated with microglial activation and a subsequent increase in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion plays a critical role in the development of lasting behavioral sequelae observed in PASC. These data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.">

        <tr id="Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a drastic loss of dopaminergic neurons already at diagnosis. As this loss of neurons starts decades before diagnosis, understanding the prodromal stages of the disease might offer novel strategies to curb its progression. While the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying PD remain incompletely understood, growing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation play a central role in the development and progression of the disease. Here, we delve into the emerging roles of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, in the pathogenesis of prodromal and early-stage PD. We emphasize that microglia contribute to neuroinflammation, protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet known. Neuroimaging studies have provided valuable insights into the patterns of microglial activation detected in individuals with prodromal PD and at the time of clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, we highlight the complex interplay between immune dysregulation and neurodegeneration along PD development, including alterations in the peripheral immune system, brain-gut interactions and brain-immune interfaces. Lastly, we outline existing models for investigating microglial involvement in prodromal PD, along with the impact of anti-inflammatory therapies and strategies to modify risk factors. In conclusion, targeting microglial activation and immune dysfunctions in individuals at risk of PD could represent a promising preventive measure and may offer novel therapeutic strategies for early intervention and disease modification.">

Herein, we show that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels and markers of neutrophil activation are associated with disease severity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We also provide a link between the adaptive and innate immune response by demonstrating an association between antibody levels and multiple markers of neutrophil degranulation and NETosis. We further demonstrate through a series of in vitro assays that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-antibody immune complexes can stimulate NETosis. Last, we discuss how this NETosis is more strongly associated with IgA immune complexes than IgG and can be ameliorated with spleen tyrosine kinase inhibition.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The concept of macrophage polarization has been largely used in human diseases to define a typology of activation of myeloid cells reminiscent of lymphocyte functional subsets. In COVID‐19, several studies have investigated myeloid compartment dysregulation and macrophage polarization as an indicator of disease prognosis and monitoring. SARS‐CoV‐2 induces an in vitro activation state in monocytes and macrophages that does not match the polarization categories in most studies. In COVID‐19 patients, monocytes and macrophages are activated but they do not show a polarization profile. Therefore, the investigation of polarization under basic conditions was not relevant to assess monocyte and macrophage activation. The analysis of monocytes and macrophages with high‐throughput methods has allowed the identification of new functional subsets in the context of COVID‐19. This approach proposes an innovative stratification of myeloid cell activation. These new functional subsets of myeloid cells would be better biomarkers to assess the risk of complications in COVID‐19, reserving the concept of polarization for pharmacological programme evaluation. This review reappraises the polarization of monocytes and macrophages in viral infections, particularly in COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Background Hypercapnia, an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) complication after pulmonary sepsis, remains enigmatic in terms of its immunological mechanisms. Our study was designed to compare initial values and longitudinal changes in cellular composition and inflammatory biomarkers between pneumonia sepsis-induced ARDS patients without hypercapnia and hypercapnia patients. Methods Between Dec 2022-Apr 2023, we prospectively studied 61 severe pneumonia patients. Eleven non-sepsis pneumonia patients were controls; 50 patients with pulmonary sepsis met ARDS criteria, 26 among them developed hypercapnia. We collected clinical data, respiratory parameters, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at Day 1 and Day 7 post-intubation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (ScRNA-seq) was performed between selected hypercapnia and non-hypercapnia patients to characterize immune and cellular profiles. Specimens were analyzed via flow cytometry and cytokine panel. Results By compiling clinical data and specimens, we found that hypercapnia patients with ARDS had poorer outcomes and higher mortality. At day 1, ScRNA-seq and cytometric analysis revealed increase in monocytes and activation of cytokine storm genes with elevated interleukin (IL) −1β, IL-12p40, and IL-23 in peripheral blood. In hypercapnia patients, percentage of CD14+CD16- classical monocyte and concentrations of IL-12p40 and IL-23 increased from day 1 to day 7 in both circulation and airways. However, these alterations of cellular phenotype and cytokine decreased during seven-treatment period in non-hypercapnia patients. Conclusion We offer novel perspectives on monocyte-centered clusters and associated biomarkers, which play a pivotal role in driving hypercapnia after pulmonary sepsis-induced ARDS. Our study provides fresh insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying hypercapnia in ARDS, laying the foundation for useful therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected hundreds of millions of people globally, resulting in millions of deaths. During this pandemic, children have demonstrated greater resistance than adults, exhibiting lower infection rates, reduced mortality, and milder symptoms. Summarizing the differences in resistance between children and adults during COVID-19 can provide insights into protective mechanisms and potential implications for future treatments. In this review, we focused on summarizing and discussing the mechanisms for better protection of children in COVID-19. These protective mechanisms encompass several factors: the baseline expression of cell surface receptor ACE2 and hydrolase TMPRSS2, the impact of complications on COVID-19, and age-related cytokine profiles. Additionally, differences in local and systemic immune responses between children and adults also contribute significantly, particularly interferon responses, heterologous protection from non-COVID-19 vaccinations, and immune status variations influenced by micronutrient levels. The advantageous protection mechanisms of these children may provide insights into the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Importantly, while age-related metabolic profiles and differential COVID-19 vaccine responses may contribute to protection in children, current comparative research remains limited and requires further investigation.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are a granulocytic population of myeloid cells that have critical effector functions during infectious disease but are generally thought to be short-lived and nonproliferative with markedly limited activation states. In these studies, we directly compared lung neutrophil activation following infection with different groups of pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and helminths. Our results demonstrate considerable heterogeneity depending on the type of infectious agent. In contrast to bacterial and fungal infection, after helminth infection neutrophils expressed markers associated with characteristic type 2 responses and unexpectedly upregulated genes associated with cell cycling and protein synthesis. Further studies showed reduced neutrophil cell death following helminth infection and increased proliferation, which was dependent on IL-4R signaling. This distinct subset of proliferating neutrophils expanded following helminth infection and was released from the endothelial niche to colocalize with invading parasites in the airways.

Therefore, further research on common viral infections in the elderly population, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses, is crucial for scientific progress. This review delves into the genetic structure, infection mechanisms, and impact of coinfections with these two viruses and provides a detailed analysis of the reasons for the increased susceptibility of elderly individuals to dual viral infections. We evaluated the clinical manifestations in elderly individuals following coinfections, including complications in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Ultimately, we have summarized the current strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza coinfections in older adults. Through these studies, we aim to reduce the risk of dual infections in elderly individuals and provide a scientific basis for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of age-related viral diseases, thereby improving their health status.">

        <tr id="Introduction Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) variants have been identified as risk factors for neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s disease. TREM2 is a cell surface receptor on microglia that regulates homeostatic and immunomodulatory functions, including phagocytosis of apoptotic debris and the resolution of damage-associated inflammation. It remains unclear how TREM2 may mediate an influence on neurodegenerative disease, particularly in relation to key neuropathological hallmarks such as neuronal loss and proteinopathy. Methods We used the ME7 prion disease model to assess the role of TREM2 in the progression and pathology of neurodegenerative disease. Prion diseases are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins and provide a highly tractable platform to determine if TREM2 has disease-modifying effects. Results Trem2−/− and wild-type (WT) mice were inoculated intracerebrally with mouse-passaged ME7 scrapie prions, and their effects on CNS disease pathogenesis were determined. Although the accumulation of prion disease-specific PrP was similar in the brains of mice from each group, the severity of neuropathology was increased in Trem2−/− mice. Morphometric analysis of the microglia also indicated blunted disease-induced reactivity in the brains of infected Trem2−/− mice compared to wild-type (WT) controls. Expression of genes involved in myelination was reduced in prion-infected Trem2−/− mice compared to infected WT mice. Conclusion We conclude that during brain infection with prions, TREM2 supports microglial reactive changes associated with resilience to neuronal loss independently of affecting misfolded PrP deposition. These data imply that TREM2 status may be an important influence on the downstream response to CNS proteinopathy, which alters the susceptibility of neurons and brain tissue to proteinopathy-induced degenerative changes.">

        <tr id="Identifying immune markers driving early and effective antibody response in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical due to the threat of future coronavirus pandemics, incomplete global vaccination, and suboptimal booster coverage. Patients with life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are characterized by dysregulated thromboinflammation and cytokine storm that could influence the isotype virus-specific antibody response and the subsequent clinical outcome. We investigated the association between COVID-19-related mortality with the dynamics, magnitude, and relative avidity of nucleoprotein (N), spike (S), and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM, IgA, and IgG in circulation. We also assessed the relationship between the virus-specific antibody responses and cytokine patterns, as well as systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation markers. This multicenter study included COVID-19 patients hospitalized early in the pandemic, classified as survivors (n=62) and non-survivors (n=17). We developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to evaluate each virus-specific isotype using well-characterized outpatient COVID-19 (n=180) and pre-pandemic cohorts (n=111). The pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as the regulatory IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNFRI) levels were evaluated. The ELISAs performed highly for all virus-specific isotypes, although modest for IgM-N. Non-survivors increased N-specific, but no S-specific, IgM and IgA responses throughout the disease course and, more notably, a delayed class switching to IgG-S and IgG-RBD compared to survivors. No differences were observed in the virus-specific IgG relative avidity. Survivors exhibited an antibody response proportional to the degree of systemic and pulmonary thromboinflammation, whereas non-survivors showed those dissociated because of their uncontrolled severe thromboinflammation. Only the survivors showed a dominant regulatory cytokine pattern in the early phase of infection (<10 days after symptoms onset), which strongly correlated with developing IgG-S and IgG-RBD protective antibodies. We developed easy-to-use immune assays that enable patient monitoring and identify at-risk populations in low- to middle-income regions. Non-survivors displayed an ineffective N-mediated antibody response, marked by an inability to control inflammation and a compromised time-dependent class switching toward S and RBD-specific IgG. The regulatory cytokine axis, including TGF-β1, maybe a critical immune correlate of effective antibody-mediated immunity in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is one of the key pathological features of AD, which is cytotoxic and can damage neurons, thereby causing cognitive dysfunction. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-invasive physical therapy that induces changes in the intrinsic mechanisms of cells and tissues through low-power light exposure. Although PBM has been employed in the treatment of AD, the effect and precise mechanism of PBM on AD-induced neurological damage are still unclear. Methods In vivo experiments, PBM (808 nm, 20 mW/cm2) was used to continuously interfere with APP/PS1 mice for 6 weeks, and then their cognitive function and AD pathological changes were evaluated. In vitro experiments, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce microglia to model inflammation, and the effect of PBM treatment on microglia polarization status and phagocytic Aβ ability was evaluated. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) was used to study the effect of PBM treatment on mitochondrial energy metabolism in microglia. Results PBM further ameliorates AD-induced cognitive impairment by alleviating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, thereby attenuating nerve damage. In addition, PBM can also reduce neuroinflammation by promoting microglial anti-inflammatory phenotypic polarization; Promotes Aβ clearance by enhancing the ability of microglia to engulf Aβ. Among them, PBM regulates microglial polarization and inhibits neuronal apoptosis, which may be related to its regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, promotion of oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibition of glycolysis. Conclusion PBM regulates neuroinflammatory response and inhibits neuronal apoptosis, thereby repairing Aβ-induced neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction. Mitochondrial energy metabolism plays an important role in PBM in improving nerve injury in AD mice. This study provides theoretical support for the subsequent application of PBM in the treatment of AD.

        <tr id="The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury are highly complex. Previous studies have indicated phenotypic changes in various cell types following stroke but have failed to identify the key regulatory genes and cell subtypes associated with the disease. The study utilized five datasets: GSE227651, GSE104036, GSE116878, GSE249957, and GSE22255. The Seurat pipeline was employed for standard quality control and single-cell data analysis. Monocle2 and CytoTRACE were used for trajectory analysis, while Mfuzz was applied to identify time-series gene expression patterns. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice served as the animal model for cerebral I/R injury, and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated BV2 cells were used to simulate microglial phenotypic changes following ischemia-reperfusion. qPCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect key gene and protein alterations. P65 was identified as a key transcription factor driving inflammatory responses and transcriptional changes following ischemic stroke. Two microglial subtypes, Cx3cr1 + and Cdk1+, were identified, with their proportions significantly increasing on days 1 and 3 after MCAO. Increased levels of inflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and P65 phosphorylation in microglia were observed in both the MCAO animal model and OGD/R cell model. Notably, inhibition of P65 phosphorylation effectively suppressed the progression of inflammation during cerebral I/R injury. We identified microglial subtypes associated with inflammatory responses following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, with their proportions increasing post-injury. P65 was confirmed as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response, contributing to neuronal protection and the restoration of neurological function.

        <tr id="Ischemic stroke triggers a cascade of pathological events that affect multiple cell types and often lead to incomplete functional recovery. Despite advances in single-cell technologies, the molecular and cellular responses that contribute to long-term post-stroke impairment remain poorly understood. To gain better insight into the underlying mechanisms, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from distinct brain regions using a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia at one month post-injury. Our findings reveal cell- and region-specific changes within the stroke-injured and peri-infarct brain tissue. For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions. Common molecular features were linked to inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix organization, and angiogenesis. Our findings provide a detailed resource for advancing our molecular understanding of stroke pathology and for discovering therapeutic targets in the repair phase of stroke recovery.

        <tr id="Background: Atherosclerosis is a progressive and complex vascular pathology characterized by cellular heterogeneity, metabolic dysregulation, and chronic inflammation. Despite extensive research, the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain incompletely understood. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to conduct a comprehensive mapping of immune cell enrichment and interactions within atherosclerotic plaques, aiming to investigate the cellular and molecular complexities of these structures. This approach facilitated a deeper understanding of the heterogeneities present in smooth muscle cells, which were subsequently analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to monitor the developmental trajectories of smooth muscle cell (SMC) subpopulations. An integrative bioinformatics approach, primarily utilizing Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning techniques, identified Cathepsin C (CTSC), transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI), and glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) as critical biomarkers. A diagnostic risk score model was developed and rigorously tested through Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. To illustrate the functional impact of CTSC on the regulation of plaque formation and SMC viability, both in vitro and in vivo experimental investigations were conducted. Results: An analysis revealed SMCs identified as the most prominent cellular type, exhibiting the highest density of disulfidptosis. Pseudotime trajectory analysis illuminated the dynamic activation pathways in SMCs, highlighting their significant role in plaque development and instability. Further characterization of macrophage subtypes demonstrated intercellular communication with SMCs, which exhibited specific signaling pathways, particularly between the proximal and core areas of plaques. The integrated diagnostic risk score model, which incorporates CTSC, TGFBI, and GMFG, proved to be highly accurate in distinguishing high-risk patients with elevated immune responses and systemic inflammation. Knockdown experiments of CTSC conducted in vitro revealed enhanced SMC survival rates, reduced oxidative stress, and inhibited apoptosis, while in vivo experiments confirmed a decrease in plaque burden and improvement in lipid profiles. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the significance of disulfidptosis in the development of atherosclerosis and identifies CTSC as a potential therapeutic target for stabilizing plaques by inhibiting SMC apoptosis and oxidative damage. Additionally, the risk score model serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying high-risk patients and guiding precision treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.

        <tr id="The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has posed significant healthcare challenges. In addition to respiratory complications, it has led to severe damage in other organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Of which, myocardial injury is increasingly recognized as a most significant complication, contributing to the high mortality. Recent research indicates the pivotal role of immune dysregulation in mediating myocardial injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the immune mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced myocardial damage, focusing on the roles of key immune cells and molecules that contribute to this pathological process. Aiming at mitigating the myocardial injury of COVID-19, we review immune-based treatments under evaluation in preclinical and clinical trials. Along with talking about the similarities and differences in myocardial injury resulting from SARS-CoV-2, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This article provides a unique perspective on using past experiences to prevent myocardial injury in the face of ongoing virus mutations.">

        <tr id="Introduction Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to COVID19 disease and caused a worldwide pandemic in 2019. Since the first wave of infections, there has been significant antigenic shifts, leading to the emergence of new variants. Today, infections have shifted away from the severe, fatal infection seen in 2019. Objective This study aimed to assess how the plasma metabolomes from patients varied with infection with different strains and could reflect disease severity. Methods Patients with COVID19 not requiring intensive care were recruited between January 2021 and May 2022 from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham; 33 patients with alpha, 13 delta and 14 omicron variants. These were compared to 26 age matched contemporaneously recruited controls. Plasma samples were extracted into chloroform/methanol/water (1:2.5/1 v/v) and assessed by flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (FIE-MS) using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Derived data were assessed using the R based MetaboAnalyst platform. Results Plasma metabolomes from COVID19 patients were clearly different from controls. Metabolite variation could be related to infection with different SARS-CoV2 variants. Variant showed different levels of some phospholipids, ganglioside GD1a and a dihydroxyvitamin D3 derivative. Correlations of the plasma metabolomes indicated negative correlations between selected phospholipids and the levels of C-reactive protein, creatinine, neutrophil and D-dimer. Conclusion The plasma metabolomes of COVID19 patients show changes, particularly in phospholipids, which could reflect disease severity and SARS-CoV2 variant infection.

        <tr id="Background Septic shock is linked with high mortality and significant long-term morbidity in survivors. However, the specific role of neutrophils in septic shock pathophysiology remains scarce in recent research. Methods Peripheral blood immune cells from healthy donors and patients with septic shock were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing and batch RNA sequencing. We measured serum CD121b in both patients and healthy donors. Peripheral immune cells were isolated and exposed to either a CD121b recombinant protein or a CD121b blocking antibody to evaluate the expression of inflammatory factors. Additionally, in a humanized mouse sepsis model, the expression of CD121b in neutrophils across different tissues was assessed following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Results This study identified a subset of CD10-CD121b+ neutrophils in the peripheral blood of patients with septic shock. These patients exhibited elevated concentrations of soluble CD121b in serum and urine. Furthermore, outcomes revealed that the presence of CD121b+ neutrophils positively correlated with the severity of septic shock. These cells displayed immunosuppressive characteristics; after blocking CD121b, proinflammatory cytokines increased in peripheral immune cells. Additionally, we found that treatment with ATRA down-regulated the expression of CD121b. Conclusions CD121b is closely associated with the progression of septic shock and may serve as a potential predictor indicator of immunosuppression for the condition.">

        <tr id="Introduction There are significant challenges remain in accurately categorizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. Objectives We used an untargeted 1H NMR-based metabolomics to assess the metabolomic changes in serum samples from a Danish cohort of 106 COVID-19-infected patients with mild to fatal disease courses and from patients with fatal outcomes from other diseases. Methods In total, 240 serum samples were used for this study. We used the data for multiple analyses (1) to construct a predictive model for disease severity and outcome, (2) to identify prognostic markers for subsequent disease severity and outcome, and (3) to understand the disease consequences in the metabolome and how recovery or death is reflected in the altered biological pathways. Results Our results revealed distinct alterations in the serum metabolome that could differentiate patients with COVID-19 by severity (mild or severe) or outcome (death or survival). Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and four machine learning algorithms (random forest, linear support vector machine, PLS-DA, and logistic regression), we identified two biomarker sets with relevant biological functions that predict subsequent disease severity and patient outcome. The range of these severity-associated biomarkers was equally broad and included inflammatory markers, amino acids, fluid balance, ketone bodies, glycolysis-related metabolites, lipoprotein particles, and fatty acid levels. Conclusions Our data suggest the potential benefits of broader testing of these metabolites from newly diagnosed patients to predict which COVID-19 patients will progress to severe disease and which patients will manifest severe symptoms to minimize mortality.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated a global pandemic resulting in an estimated 775 million infections with over 7 million deaths, it has become evident that COVID-19 is not solely a pulmonary disease. Emerging evidence has shown that, in a subset of patients, certain symptoms − including chest pain, stroke, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and abdominal pain – all indicate a role of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in the disease process. Many of these disease processes persist long after the acute disease has been resolved, resulting in ‘long COVID’ or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The molecular mechanisms underlying the acute and systemic conditions associated with COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Appropriate animal models provide a method of understanding underlying disease mechanisms at the system level through the study of disease progression, tissue pathology, immune system response to the pathogen and behavioral responses. However, very few studies have addressed PASC and whether existing models hold promise for studying this challenging problem. Here, we review the current literature on cardiovascular, neurological and GI pathobiology caused by COVID-19 in patients, along with established animal models of the acute disease manifestations and their prospects for use in PASC studies. Our aim is to provide guidance for the selection of appropriate models in order to recapitulate certain aspects of the disease to enhance the translatability of mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Although the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the emergence of the post-COVID-19 condition presents a new and complex public health challenge, characterized by persistent, multisystem symptoms that can endure for weeks or months after the initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, significantly affecting survivors’ quality of life. Among the most concerning sequelae are cardiovascular complications, which encompass a broad spectrum of conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial damage, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This narrative review explores the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiovascular health by reviewing the latest and most relevant findings in the literature and highlighting different aspects of COVID-19’s cardiovascular involvement. This review investigates the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular involvement in the post-COVID-19 condition, with a focus on direct viral invasion via ACE2 receptors, immune-mediated cardiovascular injury, cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and mitochondrial injury. The interplay between pre-existing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and COVID-19 is also explored, revealing that individuals with such conditions are at heightened risk for both severe acute illness and long-term complications. Long-term immune activation and the persistence of viral antigens are increasingly recognized as contributors to ongoing cardiovascular damage, even in individuals with mild or asymptomatic initial infections. As the healthcare system continues to adapt to the long-term consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a deeper understanding of these cardiovascular manifestations is essential. This knowledge will inform the development of targeted strategies for prevention, clinical management, and rehabilitation of affected patients. Furthermore, the insights gained from the intersection of COVID-19 and cardiovascular health will be instrumental in shaping responses to future viral epidemics, highlighting the necessity for multidisciplinary approaches to patient care and public health preparedness.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Damage to white matter and myelin poses a significant challenge to neurological recovery in the chronic phase of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The repair of myelin damage post-ICH largely depends on the activation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes, a process that is significantly influenced by the inflammatory microenvironment. Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) regulate phenotypic transformation of microglia and thus modulates inflammation. However, the exact role of Lcn2 in facilitating myelin recovery during the chronic phase of ICH remains to be fully understood. Methods: To create the ICH model, autologous blood from male C57BL/6 and Lcn2fl/flCx3cr1Cre mice was utilized. Behavioral tests were conducted to evaluate neurological recovery. The differentiation of OPCs and extent of myelin recovery were assessed using OPC and myelin markers. A multi-factor inflammatory chip was employed to investigate potential molecular regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, the Lcn2 inhibitor ZINC-94/89 was administered to explore its potential in targeting Lcn2 for enhancing myelin recovery during the chronic phase of ICH. Results: Knocking out Lcn2 in microglia significantly improved behavioral performance in chronic ICH mice, reduced inflammatory response, and enhanced myelin recovery. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that Lcn2 knockout promoted microglia transformation to the M2 phenotype and enhanced OPCs differentiation. Mechanistically, Lcn2 knockout might affect Gdf-1 secretion in BV2 cells by modulating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Treatment with JAK inhibitors decreased Gdf-1 expression in BV2 cells, inhibiting OPCs migration and differentiation. Additionally, phosphorylation of Stat3 at Thr705 plays a critical role in enhancing Gdf-1 transcription and translation. Administration of the Lcn2 inhibitor ZINC-94/89 significantly improved behavioral performance, reduced inflammatory response, and promoted myelin recovery in chronic ICH mice. Conclusions: Lcn2 is crucial for myelin recovery in the chronic phase of ICH by modulating microglial phenotypes, thereby enhancing the migration and differentiation of OPCs. Administering an Lcn2 inhibitor early on could serve as a novel and effective strategy to boost recovery during this phase.">

        <tr id="Rationale: As a highly plastic population, parenchymal astrocytes have demonstrated the capacity to become activated and recapitulate neurogenic potential in response to traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries, representing a latent reservoir for neuronal regeneration in non-neurogenic brain regions. However, the extrinsic and intrinsic factors regulating this process remain poorly characterized. Elucidating these molecular mechanisms is crucial to harnessing the regenerative potential of reactive astrocytes in CNS repair. Methods: A multidisciplinary approach combining immunostaining, western blotting, RNA interference (RNAi), gene knock out and fate-mapping was used to investigate the role of topoisomerase IIα (TOP2a) in regulation of the stemness response in reactive astrocytes to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Results: Both in vitro and in vivo analyses demonstrated that TBI induces a stem cell-like response in reactive astrocytes concomitant with TOP2a upregulation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of TOP2a significantly attenuated this stemness response. Neurosphere culture assay indicates that TOP2a might act as a downstream factor of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling to mediate the acquisition of stem cell potential. Conclusions: This study identifies TOP2a as a pivotal intrinsic regulator of astrocytic stem cell potential in the injured brain, which will advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the stem cell response and its therapeutic application in neural regeneration.">

        <tr id="Background Defining the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses is critical for informing the management of reinfections, vaccinations, and therapeutics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Using four antibody assays, we evaluated antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and receptor binding domain (RBD) in 98 convalescent participants with varying COVID-19 disease severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate or severe) at 1, 3, 6, and 12-months post-SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR and in 17 non-vaccinated, non-infected controls. Results Increasing acute COVID-19 disease severity correlates with higher anti-N and anti-RBD titers throughout 12 months post-infection. Anti-N and anti-RBD titers decline over time in all participants, except for increased anti-RBD titers post-vaccination, with hospitalized participants exhibiting faster decay rates. Less than 50% of participants retain anti-N titers above controls at 12 months, with non-hospitalized participants falling below controls sooner. Nearly all participants maintain anti-RBD titers above controls for 12 months, suggesting long-term protection against severe reinfections. Nonetheless, by 6 months, few participants retain >50% of their initial 1-month anti-N or anti-RBD titers. Notably, vaccine-induced anti-RBD titers are higher in non-hospitalized participants. Lastly, early convalescent titers correlate with age but not with Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) status or steroid use. Conclusion Hospitalized participants initially develop higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers that decline faster relative to non-hospitalized participants. While anti-N titers fall below control levels in some participants, anti-RBD titers remain above controls over 12 months, demonstrating long-lived antibody responses known to protect against severe disease. These findings advance our understanding of COVID-19 antibody dynamics.">

        <tr id="COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has a diverse spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe and critical cases that result in the death of the patient. Alongside the viral factors host factors like Age, deregulation of the immune response and presence of comorbidity determine the patient’s outcome. Here we sought to assess the impact of age on natural antibody response, CBC-based inflammatory markers, and outcome of COVID-19 patients. We divided the participants into three groups, young (≤ 35 years), middle-aged (40–60 years), and old (≥ 65 years) patients and collected and analyzed sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. We found that elderly patients showed higher (P < 0.05) levels of inflammation like increased neutrophil percentages, NLR, lymphopenia, and low Hgb levels, compared to middle-aged and young patients. Interestingly these markers were also associated with mortality of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in ion concentration, lipid profile, and coagulation test between the three age groups. We also found that elderly patients showed significantly (P < 0.05) decreased levels of natural antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the two groups. Lastly, we assessed the effect of dexamethasone treatment, even if statistically not significant (P > 0.05) we observed a positive trend among patients under dexamethasone in the aspect of decreasing inflammatory markers. To conclude we showed that SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by an age-dependent deregulation of inflammatory markers that are associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients.

        <tr id="Background: Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccinations are essential in controlling the pandemic. However, due to their exclusion from clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, there is limited data on the vaccines’ effectiveness and safety for this group. Objectives: We evaluated humoral (anti-S antibody) and cellular (T-cell) immune response in patients with solid cancer on systemic anticancer treatment versus healthy controls prime-vaccinated by the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Methods: CoVigi was the phase IV prospective open-label non-randomized multicentric clinical trial evaluating anti-S and anti-N SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell response by IFN-γ-release assay in several time points during the prime COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (prior to the first vaccine dose, prior to the second dose, at 4–8 weeks, at 3 months, and 6 months after vaccination). Immune response was analyzed in the context of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and anticancer therapy (chemotherapy (CT) + monoclonal antibodies (mAb), mAb, immune checkpoint inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and curative radiotherapy). Results: Among 204 patients with solid cancer and 73 healthy controls, 65% of SARS-CoV-2-naïve patients with cancer developed anti-S antibodies after the first vaccine dose, rising to 92% after the second dose. By 6 months, all BNT162b2-vaccinated patients with solid cancer developed antibody response. Patients treated with CT showed impaired both humoral and cellular immune response to BNT162b2 vaccination. Antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2-recovered patients were comparable to healthy controls. T-cell response peaked after the second dose of BNT162b2 and was not significantly impaired in solid cancer patients except those treated with CT. Conclusion: Immune response to BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is substantially shaped by pre-vaccination COVID-19 infection. All patients with solid cancer on active anticancer therapy exhibited seroconversion after COVID-19 vaccination, although the extent of both humoral and cell immune response was substantially hampered in those treated by CT.

 Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has ended, the enduring health impacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection continue to garner global attention, as approximately 10% of patients develop long COVID (post COVID-19 condition). The epidemiological characteristics and symptoms of long COVID have been reported, and various pathogenic hypotheses have been proposed. Recent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids or fragments persist in some patients post-infection and that these are correlated with long COVID symptoms. This review focuses on clinical studies linking SARS-CoV-2 persistence to long COVID symptoms, and explores the relationship between viral persistence and other etiological hypotheses, such as immune dysregulation, vascular issues, coagulation dysfunction, microbiome dysbiosis, brainstem/vagus nerve signaling dysfunction, and latent virus reactivation. Futhermore, treatment strategies for long COVID are proposed based on current clinical trials of antiviral and immune modulation therapies. Understanding the role of viral persistence in long COVID pathogenesis is critical for developing targeted therapies and improving clinical management of this debilitating condition.

        <tr id="The role of immune metabolism, specific metabolites and cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic metabolic states across the time course of an inflammatory response are emerging knowledge. Targeted and untargeted metabolomic analysis is essential to understand how immune cells adapt their metabolic program throughout an immune response. In addition, metabolomic analysis can aid to identify pathophysiological patterns in inflammatory disease. Here, we discuss new metabolomic findings within the transition from inflammation to resolution, focusing on three key programs of immunity: Efferocytosis, IL-10 signaling and trained immunity. Particularly the tryptophan-derived metabolite kynurenine was identified as essential for efferocytosis and inflammation resolution as well as a potential biomarker in diverse inflammatory conditions. In summary, metabolomic analysis and integration with transcriptomic and proteomic data, high resolution imaging and spatial information is key to unravel metabolic drivers and dependencies during inflammation and progression to tissue-repair.">

        <tr id="Abstract Aging has a profound impact on the immune system, leading to a gradual decline in its function and increased systemic inflammation, collectively known as immunosenescence and inflammaging. These changes make older adults more susceptible to infections, including COVID‐19, and contribute to worse clinical outcomes, such as higher morbidity and mortality rates. This review explores immunological changes associated with aging, including impaired innate immune responses, reduced T‐ and B‐cell function, and altered cytokine profiles. A comprehensive literature search identified relevant studies on the topic, and inclusion criteria focused on studies addressing age‐related immune changes and their impact on responses to COVID‐19.

        <tr id="Background: Understanding factors that predict progression to severe COVID-19 is critical. Antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein confer protection, while the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays roles in viral replication and immune dysfunction. This study explores the significance of N protein and anti-spike antibodies on disease severity, progression, and mortality. Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 N protein and anti-spike antibody levels with disease severity, clinical outcomes, and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Design: A secondary analysis of serologic data from participants in the ACTIV-1 randomized clinical trial, which evaluated immunomodulators for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A subanalysis of the ACTIV-1 immune modulator trial was conducted. Samples collected at randomization were tested for N protein levels and anti-spike antibodies. Logistic regression and linear models were employed to examine the association between serological measures and clinical outcomes, including 28-day mortality as well as progression to high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Results: Among the 496 participants with detectable serum N protein, the median was 1143 ng/dL, and levels decreased from 2559 ng/dL in participants randomized at 6 days of symptom onset to 477.6 ng/dL at 11 days. Higher anti-spike antibody levels were seen as the days from symptom onset progressed or disease severity increased. Greater disease severity at randomization was associated with 28-day mortality, prolonged days of oxygenation, ventilation, hospitalization, and risk of new non-invasive ventilation, HFNC, MV, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use. N protein levels were associated with a higher risk of new non-invasive ventilation or HFNC use, longer oxygenation duration, and extended hospitalization. Anti-spike antibody serologies were not associated with clinical outcomes. Conclusion: N protein levels could provide insights into COVID-19 disease progression and prognosis. Further research is needed to explore the clinical implications of these findings to optimize patient care and enhance outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Neuropathological and clinical studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may increase the long-term risk of neurodegeneration. Methods We provide a narrative overview of pathological and clinical observations justifying the implementation of a surveillance program to monitor changes in the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the years after COVID-19. Results Autopsy studies revealed diverse changes in the brain, including loss of vascular integrity, microthromboses, gliosis, demyelination, and neuronal- and glial injury and cell death, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals irrespective of the severity of COVID-19. Recent data suggest that microglia play an important role in sustained COVID-19-related inflammation, which contributes to the etiology initiating a neurodegenerative cascade, to the worsening of pre-existing neurodegenerative disease or to the acceleration of neurodegenerative processes. Histopathological data have been supported by neuroimaging, and epidemiological studies also suggested a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases after COVID-19. Conclusions Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19 during the pandemic, healthcare systems should be aware of, and be prepared for a potential increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the upcoming years. Strategies may include follow-up of well-described cohorts, analyses of outcomes in COVID-19-registries, nationwide surveillance programs using record-linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses, and comparing the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders in the post-pandemic periods to values of the pre-pandemic years. Awareness and active surveillance are particularly needed, because diverse clinical manifestations due to earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may no longer be quoted as post-COVID-19 symptoms, and hence, increasing incidence of neurodegenerative pathologies at the community level may remain unnoticed.">

        <tr id="Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus’ ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1α activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the release of interferons (IFNs) and the proinflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 cases. STAT3, a key protein in this pathway, has been implicated in promoting inflammation, making its inhibition a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles (MSC-EVs), enriched with immunomodulatory and antiviral miRNAs, offer a promising therapeutic approach by modulating gene expression and regulating inflammatory responses. This study investigates the ability of Lyophilized MSC-EVs to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, highlighting their potential application in COVID-19 management.


METHODS
Male Syrian hamsters were used as an experimental model, housed under controlled laboratory conditions. SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Egypt/NRC-03/2020) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titers were determined using plaque assays. Hamsters were intranasally challenged with the virus and treated intraperitoneally with 0.5 mL of lyophilized human Wharton's jelly-derived MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs). Histopathological evaluations were performed on lung tissues using H&E, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining. Morphometric analyses were conducted to assess lung injury and fibrosis. Western blotting was employed to evaluate protein expression. All procedures adhered to ethical and biosafety guidelines.


RESULTS
The administration of MSC-EVs significantly upregulated the expression levels of miRNA-146a, miRNA-124, miRNA-155, miRNA-29b, miRNA-7, miRNA-145 and miRNA-18a compared to their levels in the COVID-19 group, suggesting a targeted release of miRNA-cargo from the MSC-EVs into the lung tissue of the animals. MSC-EVs impaired the activation of the STAT3/STAT1 signaling pathway and reduced the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that MSC-EVs have the potential to effectively mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSC-EVs and their clinical application in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <tr id="Background Contributions of leukocytes to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) defense have been reported extensively. However, it remains unclear whether there are different leukocyte responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.

Results We found that neutrophils, immature granulocytes, and monocytes were elevated, and lymphocytes were reduced after infection. These hyperactive neutrophils/immature granulocytes and suppressed lymphocytes/monocytes were associated with poorer prognosis in ancestral strain infection. Different from the ancestral strain, hyperactive immature granulocytes were not shown in the decedents of Delta infection, and immature granulocyte concentration was not observed to be associated with mortality. In Omicron infection, suppressed lymphocytes and monocytes were not shown in the decedents, and lymphocyte/monocyte concentrations were not associated with mortality.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a threat due to the emergence of variants with increased transmissibility and enhanced escape from immune responses. Like other coronaviruses before, SARS-CoV-2 likely emerged after its transmission from bats. The successful propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans might have been facilitated by usurping evolutionarily conserved cellular factors to execute crucial steps in its life cycle, such as the generation of replication organelles—membrane structures where coronaviruses assemble their replication-transcription complex. In this study, we found that RAB5, which is highly conserved across mammals, is a critical host dependency factor for the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our results also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 uses RAB5+ membranes to build replication organelles with the aid of COPB1, a component of the COP-I complex, and that the virus protein NSP6 participates in this process. Hence, targeting NSP6 represents a promising approach to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and halt its propagation. IMPORTANCE In this study, we sought to identify the host dependency factors that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses for the generation of replication organelles: cellular membranous structures that SARS-CoV-2 builds in order to support the replication and transcription of its genome. We uncovered that RAB5 is an important dependency factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and the generation of replication organelles, and that the viral protein NSP6 participates in this process. Hence, NSP6 represents a promising target to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication.

        <tr id="Background The COVID-19 pandemic demanded diverse vaccination strategies, and there is significant interest in their effectiveness in generating a robust immune response. In Brazil, the use of CoronaVac was crucial in reducing mortality; however, heterologous booster doses were necessary to enhance memory immune response. This study aimed to evaluate the humoral and cellular immunity in healthcare workers who were vaccinated with a complete regimen of CoronaVac and subsequently received heterologous booster doses over nearly one year. Methods A longitudinal study recruited healthcare professionals with varying levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from the Health Complex of the Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Blood samples were collected at five time points, including baseline and after vaccination with CoronaVac and heterologous booster doses (ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BNT162b2). The Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production was measured by Flow Cytometry, using whole blood samples stimulated or not with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In parallel, serum levels of IgG antibodies against Spike (anti-S) and Nucleocapsid (anti-N) proteins were assessed using an immunoassay. Adjustments were made for confounding factors, including age, sex, level of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and COVID-19 infection status. Results Our results demonstrate that CoronaVac induced high anti-S IgG levels at all evaluated time points (P<0.01). Cytokine analysis revealed a sustained production of antigen-specific Th1 cytokines, including IL-2 (P<0.01) and IFN-γ (P<0.05) regardless of level of SARS-CoV-2 exposure or previous COVID-19 infection at any point during the study. Additionally, we identified six moderate to strong positive correlations (P<0.0001): IL-10 and IFN-γ (ρ=0.77), IL-6 and TNF (ρ=0.77), IL-2 and IFN-γ (ρ=0.71), IL-6 and IL-10 (ρ=0.66), anti-N IgG and anti-S IgG (ρ=0.62), and IL-2 and anti-S IgG (ρ=0.62). Conclusion The CoronaVac elicited an antigen-specific cellular immune response, characterized by enhancing the production of key cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2, with high levels of anti-S IgG. Furthermore, the administration of heterologous boosters significantly enhanced these immune responses, demonstrating induced-specific immunological response. These findings underscore the importance of primary vaccination and boosters in inducing immune protection against COVID-19, potentially informing future vaccination policies and approaches.">

        <tr id="The incidence rate of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is rising. However, the pathogenesis of CAPA remains unclear. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disrupts pathways related to type I interferon and Toll-like receptors, key components in innate immunity, thereby elevating the incidence of CAPA. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in T and B cell functional deficiencies or exhaustion within adaptive immunity, weakening the defense against invasive Aspergillus. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and alters the gut microbiota, factors that may aid in diagnosing CAPA. Immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 patients is also believed to heighten the risk of invasive aspergillosis. Therefore, this review, examines the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with invasive aspergillosis, and explores the pathogenesis and susceptibility factors of CAPA. We propose that variations in an individual’s immune response significantly determine susceptibility to CAPA. The aim of this paper is to deepen clinical understanding of CAPA’s pathogenesis, thereby aiding in mitigating susceptibility risk and advancing novel treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="Background & objectives COVID-19 is a complex disease that affects multiple systems and causes inflammation due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s attraction to ACE-2 receptors. The severity of the disease ranges from mild upper respiratory tract infections to multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Critical clinical features, such as respiratory failure, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, and a hypercoagulable state, are common in severe COVID-19 illness. Identifying patients at higher risk of rapid disease progression leading to severe complications and death is crucial. Available biomarkers lack specificity and accuracy in identifying the severity of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there is a need to identify specific endothelial biomarkers that can predict early organ damage, facilitate effective management of patients, and categorise multisystem involvement during COVID-19 infection. Methods The participants constituted laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-positive patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) features under home isolation or moderate to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) manifestations requiring admission. The chosen markers were analysed using the Human Luminex multiplex bead-based assay system. Results Our study revealed that certain markers, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and Galectin-3 were elevated in all COVID-19-positive patients, while others, like vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), Angiopoietin-2, Thrombomodulin, and tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) were specifically elevated in patients requiring admission. Such findings indicated the potential of some biomarkers in disease prognostication. Interpretation & conclusions Effective management of COVID-19 requires proper risk stratification. The findings of our investigation underscore the necessity for additional research to confirm the clinical utility and importance of these biomarkers and to fully leverage their capabilities in informing the management of severe COVID-19 disease.">

        <tr id="Background: The coronavirus–caused disease (COVID-19), first identified in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide becoming a global pandemic. Although people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus presented mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, an increase in cardiovascular incidents was observed in several scientific studies. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to disrupt the normal immune response leading to a dysregulation of immune system function and massive production of inflammatory cytokines commonly known as “cytokine storm”. Methods: 57 patients eventually participated in the study, assigned to non–COVID (24 patients) and COVID (33 patients) groups. After signing consent to participate in the study, each patient was given a self–administered questionnaire to fill out prior to specimen collection, anthropometric measurements were taken and venous blood was collected for the following determinations: pro- and anti–inflammatory cytokines using a Bio–Plex 200 system, oxidative stress markers and basic hematological blood parameters. Results: showed statistically significant higher values of IL–1Ra and IL–1β in the COVID-19 group. Of the oxidative stress markers, only MDA levels were higher in the COVID-19 group. Conclusions: the results of our study provide evidence and support the occurrence of elevated levels of IL–1Ra, IL–1β and MDA in the COVID-19 group of patients, which are associated with a worse course and prognosis of COVID-19. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and dysregulation of the immune system associated with the cytokine storm is essential to select patients at risk and develop effective drugs and vaccines.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the most numerous immune cells of the lung and are the resident, sentinel lung immunocytes that summon trafficking immune cells to the compartment. Immune profiling of AMs from COVID-19 patients implicates AMs in the immune circuits that drive pulmonary inflammation in severe COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about human AM responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, such as the spike protein and envelope protein. We aimed to understand if human AMs recognize SARS-CoV-2 proteins and how they respond. We found that human AMs do not sense SARS-CoV-2 spike protein but do sense envelope protein via the pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and TLR4, secreting IL-1β, IFNγ, IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNFα in response. AMs from donors over the age of 70 years produced significantly more cytokines than those from younger patients following stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein. AMs from current smokers had lower cytokine secretion. This is the first report of human AMs producing cytokines in response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the first to correlate those responses with clinical risk factors. These results may partly explain why older adults are at such high risk of severe lung inflammation in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Purpose Microglial activation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration, contributing to neuroinflammation within the retina. Previous studies identified that nicotinamide riboside (NR) mitigated light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) and inhibited microglial activation. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway has been recognized as a key mediator of inflammation in response to cellular stress and tissue damage. This study further explores the regulatory impact of NR on microglial activation and STING-mediated pyroptosis in retinal degeneration. Methods Balb/c mice were subjected to bright light exposure to induce retinal degeneration. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the upregulated key genes and signaling pathways involved in the progression of retinal degeneration, based on mouse transcriptomes from the LIRD model. Molecular biology techniques and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess cGAS-STING activation and expression of pyroptosis-associated molecules. Retinal function, photoreceptor apoptosis and inflammatory response were evaluated in the presence and absence of NR supplementation. Results Exposure to bright light resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of dsDNA, significantly triggering the activation of cGAS-STING pathway and microglial pyroptosis. In contrast, NR treatment preserved mitochondrial biosynthesis, inhibited STING expression in reactive microglia, and dampened the pro-inflammatory response. Additionally, intraperitoneal administration of the STING inhibitor H151 reduced light-induced microglial activation and pyroptosis, while improving retinal function and promoting photoreceptor survival. Conclusions These findings suggest that NR confers neuroprotection by attenuating damaged DNA-triggered STING-mediated microglial activation and pyroptosis. Targeting the cGAS-STING pathway presents a promising therapeutic avenue for retinal degeneration.">

        <tr id="Little is known about the regulation of B cell subpopulations in association with programmed cell death during dengue virus (DENV) infection. Therefore, blood samples from dengue-infected patients and healthy donors were obtained for B cell subset characterization and the analysis of pro-apoptotic CD95 expression in these cell subsets. The results showed that the activated memory (AM) subset in the patients remained unchanged compared to the healthy donors. In contrast, tissue memory (TM) and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were notably increased, whereas naïve cells and resting memory (RM) cells were considerably decreased. Although the ASCs maintained comparably high levels of CD95 expression in both groups, significantly increased percentages of CD95-expressing cells in the other B cell subsets were found in the patients. When B cells from the healthy donors were treated with DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), the results showed that the NS1 protein at 2 µg/mL could induce CD95 expression and the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane in most B cell subsets, except for the RM. This study demonstrates that DENV infection could induce CD95 expression in both activated and resting B cell subsets in all patients. The results also suggest a potential mechanism of apoptotic regulation in B cell subsets through the increased CD95 expression caused by the interaction between the B cells and the NS1 protein.">

        <tr id="Significance Microglia control neuroinflammation by eliminating foreign substances and debris and pruning synapses that affect cognitive function. Our study reveals that early ablation of LXRβ in the postnatal microglia results in a decrease in microglial numbers and changes in their morphology, which suggests that microglial activation has occurred. Furthermore, removing microglial LXRβ in mice during the neonatal period, but not at P30, heightened synapse engulfment and resulted in cognitive impairments. These findings show that the early deletion of LXRβ in postnatal microglia can cause dysregulation of microglial functions, including inflammation, synaptic pruning, and cognitive function.">

        <tr id="Lassa fever is a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever endemic to West Africa. In the absence of efficient prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures, it poses a substantial threat to public health in this region. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the severity of the disease are poorly known because Lassa virus (LASV), its causative agent, has to be handled in BSL-4 laboratories and access to clinical samples is difficult. The control of Lassa fever is associated with a rapid and well-balanced immune response and viral clearance. However, severe disease is characterized by uncontrolled innate immune activation and symptoms reminiscent of sepsis and a cytokine storm. In a model of cynomolgus monkeys infected with two different strains of the virus, one causing moderate disease and the other a lethal outcome, we show that the control of LASV infection is characterized by the induction of a LASV-specific T-cell response, whereas severity is associated with the expansion of suppressive myeloid cells, alterations of the stromal network of secondary lymphoid organs, and the anergy of specific T cells. These results suggest that T cells are crucial for the control of LASV and that immunomodulatory therapeutics, such as checkpoint inhibitors, could contribute to new therapeutic strategies to treat Lassa fever. They also highlight how immunosuppressive mechanisms described in sepsis and cancer patients may play a role in the pathogenicity of Lassa fever, as well as in other similar hemorrhagic fevers.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most patients recover fully after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2. Some, however, may develop pulmonary sequelae (PS) and/or long COVID (LC). However, whether these two clinical conditions have similar or different pathogenic mechanisms is unknown. Methods The levels of autoantibodies and 184 inflammatory and organ damage associated proteins in plasma were determined (by immunofluorescence and Olink panels, respectively) 1 year after an acute infection by SARS-CoV-2 in 51 patients with PS (DLCO < 80% ref), 31 patients with LC and 31 patients fully recovered (Rec). PS was defined by the presence of reduced carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) lower than 80% ref. LC was defined by the presence of chronic symptoms in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Results We found that patients with PS or LC both showed increased levels than Rec of anti-microbial, immune cell activation and recruitment related proteins. Patients with PS showed higher levels of anti-nuclear autoantibodies, whereas LC patients had increased levels of organ-damage associated proteins. In patients with PS most of the elevated proteins correlate with the impairment of lung function (DLCO). Finally, in PS we additionally performed the determinations at an earlier time point (6 months) and showed that the expression of CCL20 and IFN-ɣ was already higher at 6 months, while CCL3 and CCL19 increase from 6 to 12 months, suggesting a pathogenic role in PS persistence. Conclusions Patients with PS or LC have abnormal but different persistent circulatory immune and organ damage biomarkers, suggesting different underlying biology of both post-COVID conditions.

        <tr id="Background: Long COVID is characterized by persistent symptoms following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aims to evaluate immune system markers, including antigen-specific antibodies, B cell subsets, and Th2-related cytokines, in individuals with long COVID and to investigate their potential impact on the development of this condition. Methods: We analyzed blood plasma from 63 individuals diagnosed with long COVID based on clinical presentation and 47 healthy individuals with COVID-19 history but no clinical symptoms. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies were measured using commercial ELISA kits. Lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed via flow cytometry and a gating strategy based on CD27 and CD38. Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) were quantified using the xMAP multiplex assay. Results: We noted no significant differences in IgG levels between groups. Notably, individuals with long COVID demonstrated a higher percentage of naive mature B cells (CD27−CD38+), while transitional (CD27−CD38+++) and double-negative (DN, CD27−CD38-) cells were significantly reduced. Elevated levels of IL-5 and IL-13 were observed in long COVID patients. Classification analysis revealed that the percentage of transitional B cells (CD27−CD38+++) was a strong predictor of long COVID. Conclusions: Our findings highlight alterations in B cell dynamics among individuals with long COVID, which may contribute to autoimmune processes.">

        <tr id="Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, forming cysts in ruminants and humans with major health and economic impacts. The immune response to CE cysts is complex, with fertility linked to the host’s inflammatory reaction. This study examines γδ T cell distribution and role within the adventitial layer of non-fertile CE cysts in cattle, including cases co-infected with the trematode Fasciola hepatica (FH), a known immune response modulator. Using immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence, we observed γδ T cells dispersed in the adventitial layer, enriched in inflammatory zones. Co-infected cases (CE + FH+) showed a reduced γδ T cell proportion among CD3+ T cells compared to non-coinfected cases, suggesting an immunoregulatory effect of FH. Our findings align with prior studies showing γδ T cell recruitment in granulomatous diseases in ruminants but reveal that co-infection alters this response. This study provides the first detailed characterization of γδ T cells in cattle CE cysts, emphasizing their potential role in granulomatous immune responses. It highlights the need for further research into mechanisms influencing CE cyst fertility and immune modulation in helminth co-infections, advancing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and informing disease management strategies.

        <tr id="The gut microbiota and the immune system are closely connected, influencing early‐life brain development. Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), crucial for neuronal development, has been demonstrated to be produced by certain immune cells. However, the modulation of BDNF during bacterial antigen and metabolite challenge remains elusive. We investigate the effects of bacterial‐derived antigens and metabolites on BDNF secretion in human PBMCs. Although BDNF levels were altered during stimulation, a specific cellular origin of BDNF within PBMCs was indeterminate. Positive magnetic separation of monocytes eliminated both the stimulant‐induced BDNF secretion and reduced monocyte‐platelet aggregates. Conversely, elevated platelet counts significantly increased BDNF levels, indicating that platelets, when interacting with monocytes and exposed to bacterial antigens, are likely the dominant source of BDNF in PBMC cultures. As previously described, platelets are a crucial source of circulating peripheral blood BDNF. Our findings emphasize the importance of the interplay between immune‐blood cell complexes during microbial stimulation in regulating BDNF levels. This highlights the necessity of investigating such interactions to better understand the early‐life gut‐brain axis.">

        <tr id="Introduction Severe COVID-19 is characterized by hyperimmune host responses contributing to airway damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Type III interferons (IFN), including IFN lambda 4 (IFNλ4), expressed in individuals harboring the rs368234815-ΔG allele, are implicated in host immune responses to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Methods We investigated associations between IFNλ4 expression through genotyping and COVID-19 disease severity in 853 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases enrolled in the All-Ireland Infectious Diseases Cohort. Additionally, we measured plasma levels of Type I, II and III IFN using quantitative immunoassays along with IFNλ4 expression and COVID-19 disease severity in a sub-group [n=321 (37.6%)] with samples available within 10 days of symptom onset. IFNλ4 was expressed in 382 (44.8%) but expression was not significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Results Within the sub-group, we found no consistent associations between IFNλ4 expression and circulating IFNs. However, we observed significantly increased expression of IFNλ1 and IFNλ2 in severe COVID-19 (P<0.01), with IFNλ2 remaining significantly associated after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, including obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2) (P<0.001). Interestingly, although IFNλ2 levels were significantly higher in subjects with obesity, the association between higher IFNλ2 and COVID-19 disease severity was only observed in individuals without obesity (P<0.01). Conclusion These data reveal an important role for IFNλ2 as an immune correlate that predicts COVID-19 disease severity, which may be masked in those with obesity.">

        <tr id="Background Mitochondrial dynamics in neurons accompanied by neuroinflammation has been proved as pivotal events during repeated morphine exposure, however, the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and neuroinflammation still remains unknown. Methods This study was designed to investigate the potential role of astrocyte Drp1 in neuroinflammation during morphine addiction. Nucleus accumbens (NAc) tissues were collected for immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial fission proteins. Morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and open field test (OFT) were used to determine the effects of Mdivi-1, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 in the rewarding properties of morphine. Astrocyte-specific knockdown experiments by an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing shRNADrp1–EGFP infusion were performed to determine the effects of astrocyte Drp1 in NAc of mice with morphine treatment. Results In this study, we found that repeated morphine exposure induced mitochondrial fragmentation in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in NAc, correlating with increased inflammatory markers and addictive behaviors. The application of Mdivi-1 effectively mitigated mitochondrial fragmentation and astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation within the NAc, thereby alleviating morphine-induced addictive behaviors. Crucially, the astrocyte-specific knockdown of Drp1 in NAc significantly curtailed drug-seeking behavior and substantially reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that alterations in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly within astrocytes, play an important role in regulating neuroinflammation associated with morphine addiction. This research offers novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for addressing substance use disorder (SUD) by regulating mitochondrial dynamics within astrocyte.

        <tr id="The immune characteristics and pathological mechanisms of COVID‐19 and tuberculosis coinfection are not well understood. Single‐cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting complex immune responses and cellular interactions in infectious diseases. Here, we employed scRNA‐seq, combined with laboratory examinations and clinical observations, to elucidate potential mechanisms of immunopathology and protective immunity in coinfected patients. Substantial alterations in immune cell populations in patients with severe coinfection were observed, characterized by severe lymphopenia and massive expansion of myeloid cells. Lymphocytopenia may have resulted from lymphocyte apoptosis and migration. Systemic upregulation of S100 family proteins, mainly released by classical monocytes, might contribute to inflammatory cytokine storm via S100‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway in severely coinfected patients. Myeloid cells may contribute to immune paralysis in severe cases through expansion of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and dysregulated dendritic cell function. The immune landscape of T cells in severe patients were featured by dysregulated Th1 response, widespread exhaustion and increased cytotoxic, apoptosis, migration and inflammatory states. We observed increased plasma cells and overexpression of B‐cell‐activation‐related pathways in severe patients. Together, we provide a comprehensive atlas illustrating the immune response to coinfected patients at the single‐cell resolution and highlight mechanisms of pathogenesis in severe patients.">

        <tr id="Increasing evidence indicate that individual host immune response to pathogens may be as important as virulence factors in determining the severity of infection. However, most available data on pathogen-host interactions are based on in vitro findings, neglecting the genetic complexity of the immune response. We conducted a comparative observational study of bacterial and viral meningitis to identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent inflammatory pathways that may predict the severity of infection by analysing 54 inflammatory factors using plexing technology. Infection severity and neurological disability were assessed using the modified RANKIN scale. To identify pathogen-specific and host-dependent pathways, plex data were entered into EMBiology®™ software and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. We also investigated pathogen- and host-dependent regulatory effects on blood-brain barrier function using human iPSC-derived endothelial cells as a model. BBB function was characterised at the level of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), endothelial apoptosis and drug transporter activity. We identified 36 factors that are highly differentially regulated in either bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis compared to healthy subjects, 15 of which have not been previously described. GSEA identified previously unknown pathogen-specific pathways including neurotrophin, NOTCH, immune tolerance, antiviral defence and tight junction signalling. As a key finding, we identified 15 host-dependent factors that correlated with the grade of disability and with blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. GSEA revealed stronger responses of neuroprotective (AKT/ERK), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/p53) and anti-inflammatory (JAK1/STAT1) pathways in patients with favourable course, whereas patients with severe infection show stronger pro-inflammatory STAT-activation, NKC/CTL-responses and NFκ-B-associated neurotoxicity. BBB analysis supports these findings with dysregulation of TEER, drug transporter activity and induction of endothelial cell death in patients with severe infection. Our data highlight the need for future approaches to personalised medicine that go beyond traditional anti-infective therapy to target the individual immune response. Author Summery Infections often cause personal suffering, but also high economic costs. Brain infections such as bacterial or viral meningitis are particularly serious and carry a high risk of death or permanent disability. At the same time, resistance to anti-infective drugs is increasing and fewer new antibiotics are being developed. As a result, there is a great need for translational research to develop new treatments beyond conventional anti-infectives. Due to its strict compartmentalisation, the brain is well suited to identify specific pathogen-dependent, but also host (patient) dependent inflammatory patterns in infections. Using a cohort of patients with a defined group of pathogen-specific meningitis, we investigated the inflammatory patterns in the cerebrospinal fluid and were able to describe new specific pathogen-dependent and new host-dependent immune responses and identify associated signalling pathways. We were also able to show how and at what cellular and molecular level the blood-brain barrier is disrupted by infection. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier is an important aspect and has major implications for the course and prognosis of brain infections. Once the pathogen- and host-specific aspects of the immune response are understood, new personalised therapeutic approaches can be developed that directly target the regulation of the individual immune response.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a major global health crisis with widespread effects on healthcare, society, and economies. Initially seen as a respiratory illness, it is now recognized as a multisystem disease, with growing evidence of its impact on the nervous system. 
Neurological complications - such as cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), strokes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and mood disorders - have been reported in both severe and mild COVID-19 cases, highlighting the unpredictable nature of post-COVID sequelae. These symptoms can persist long after the acute phase of infection. 
The mechanisms behind these effects are complex and not yet fully understood. They include direct viral invasion of the central nervous system, immune dysregulation (e.g., cytokine storm, autoimmunity), and blood–brain barrier disruption, all of which may lead to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. 
The long-term neurological consequences pose significant clinical and societal challenges, requiring multidisciplinary care and tailored rehabilitation strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, underlying mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches, aiming to inform evidence-based post-COVID care.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, driven by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global health crisis, highlighting the virus’s unique molecular mechanisms that distinguish it from other respiratory pathogens. It is known that the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α) activates a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways regulating cellular energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and cell survival, contributing to the wide range of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, including Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of HIF-1α is a key driver of systemic inflammation, silent hypoxia, and pathological tissue remodeling in both the acute and post-acute phases of the disease. This scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and registered in INPLASY. It involved a literature search in Scopus and PubMed, supplemented by manual reference screening, with study selection facilitated by Rayyan software. Our analysis clarifies the dual role of HIF-1α, which may either worsen inflammatory responses and viral persistence or support adaptive mechanisms that reduce cellular damage. The potential for targeting HIF-1α therapeutically in COVID-19 is complex, requiring further investigation to clarify its precise role and translational applications. This review deepens the molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular and tissue dysfunction in hypoxia, offering insights for improving clinical management strategies and addressing long-term sequelae.">

        <tr id="Abstract Autoimmune limbic encephalitis is an inflammatory condition confined to the limbic system of the brain that is deemed to be due to a dysregulated immune response. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. Diagnosis of autoimmune limbic encephalitis currently relies on clinical consensus criteria. However, diagnostic workup can be challenging, potentially delaying treatment initiation associated with poor clinical outcomes. We retrospectively identified 640 patients (81 autoimmune limbic encephalitis, 148 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, 197 Alzheimer’s disease, 67 frontotemporal dementia, 37 temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and 110 somatic symptom disorder patients). Applying multidimensional flow-cytometry together with novel computational approaches, we analysed the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid immune cell profiles at different disease stages and performed correlations with clinical parameters (i.e. neuropsychological performance, EEG and MRI). We were able to identify a shared immune signature of autoimmune limbic encephalitis showing similarities in adaptive B and T cell response with other inflammatory central nervous system diseases and in T cell patterns with neurodegenerative disorders. Antibody-negative autoimmune limbic encephalitis showed a pronounced T cell response in peripheral blood similar to temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders differentiating from antibody-positive autoimmune limbic encephalitis and classical inflammatory central nervous system diseases with regard to B and plasma cell response. Longitudinal immune cell phenotyping in autoimmune limbic encephalitis revealed dynamic changes over time mainly affecting the innate, B and plasma cell compartment. Correlation analysis indicated associations between the baseline immune cell profile, especially lymphocytes, and neuropsychological performance, as well as EEG and MRI abnormalities. Applying novel computational approaches, we found that multidimensional flow cytometry together with routine CSF parameters could reliably distinguish autoimmune limbic encephalitis from controls and clinical differential diagnoses. Incorporation of multidimensional flow cytometry parameters showed superior discriminatory ability compared with CSF routine parameters alone. Taken together, autoimmune limbic encephalitis is characterized by a B and T cell dominated intrathecal immune-cell signature corresponding to changes reported in the brain parenchyma and showing similarities with classical inflammatory central nervous system diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Incorporating clinical parameters and applying novel computational approaches, we could show that multidimensional flow cytometry might be a beneficial complement to the established diagnostic workup of autoimmune limbic encephalitis promoting early diagnosis and facilitating outcome prediction to enhance individualized treatment regimes.">

        <tr id="Objective and design SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are recommended for mastocytosis patients. We describe clinical symptoms, chemokine, cytokine, metabolomic and lipidomic derangements in a systemic mastocytosis patient following mRNA-1273 booster vaccination. Methods Twenty-eight chemokines and cytokines, 41 amino acids and 16 lipid classes were quantified with state-of-the-art methods. Results Mast cell activation (MCA) symptoms started 24 h after the mRNA-1273 booster vaccination with significant metabolic, lipidomic and cytokine derangements. Histamine concentrations peaked at life-threatening 18 ng/ml concomitant with high tryptase. Peak plasma IL-1Ra, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, CXCL10 and GM-CSF concentrations were elevated 54-, 4.9-, 85-, 54-, 6.1-, 19- and 6.4-fold respectively. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was administered 6 h after admission, because of the highly elevated IL-6 concentrations. More than one year later IL-6 was highly elevated during another MCA attack likely caused by a PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and tocilizumab was again used. Clinical symptoms improved during the following 12 h similar to the vaccine booster MCA attack. Conclusions A mRNA-1273 first booster vaccination likely caused a delayed severe MCA attack with highly elevated Th2-biased cytokines with metabolic and lipidomic derangements. Administration of an IL-6 receptor blocker during both MCA attacks might have shortened the duration of clinical symptoms.

        <tr id="Neurodegenerative diseases, contributing to the significant socioeconomic burden due to aging society, are gaining increasing interest. Despite each disease having different etiologies, neuroinflammation is believed to play a crucial role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition to the pathogenic function of inflammation in the brain there is growing evidence that immune responses are essential for neuroregeneration. This review compares and contrasts the neuroinflammatory pathways that selected neurodegenerative diseases share and have in common. In AD, tau tangles and beta-amyloid plaques cause microglia and astrocytes to become activated in an inflammatory response. Alpha-synuclein aggregation stimulate neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease, especially in the substantia nigra. In Multiple Sclerosis an autoimmune attack on myelin is connected to inflammation via invading immune cells. Commonalities include the release of pro-inflammatory mediators like cytokines and activation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK. Comprehending these common routes is essential for discovering early diagnostic possibilities for the diseases and possible tailored treatments. Our work underscores the potential for insights into disease mechanisms. Identifying common targets offers promise for advancing our understanding and potential future treatment approaches across these debilitating disorders.">

        <tr id="Objective To elucidate crucial immune cell subsets and associated immunological pathways by stratifying patients with immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) using immunophenotyping and transcriptomic approaches. Methods We conducted flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses in 23 immune cell subsets derived from 235 patients with six IMDs, using our database, utilizing our database, ImmuNexUT. Patients were stratified based on immunophenotyping data. Subsequently, we examined clinical and transcriptomic differences among these stratified clusters. Results Patients with IMDs were stratified into two clusters based on their immunophenotypes. Cluster 1 was enriched with differentiated B cells, including unswitched memory B cells (USM B), switched memory B cells, double-negative B cells and plasmablasts, while cluster 2 was enriched with naïve B cells. Higher disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and decreased respiratory functions in systemic sclerosis were observed in cluster 1, whereas the disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus was higher in cluster 2. Numerous differentially expressed genes were detected in USM B. Cluster 1 was associated with glycosylation processes in USM B and elevated B cell-activating factor signalling from myeloid cells in B cells, while cluster 2 exhibited higher B-cell receptor signalling in USM B. Patients in cluster 2, which had an elevated age-associated B-cell signature, exhibited more frequent flares, suggesting that an increased proportion of naïve B cells with this signature is associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion Immunophenotyping-based clusters and transcriptome-based states revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in B cells. To predict IMD prognosis, assessing both the quantity and quality of naïve B cells may be crucial.">

        <tr id="The outcome of COVID-19 disease is strongly related to the interaction between the virus and the host immune response, which may become dysregulated in critically ill patients. This dysregulated response is characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory mediators, an overactivation of the innate immune system, 1 lymphopenia, 2 delayed antibody and interferon responses, 3 and a massive dissemination of viral components into the blood, 4 all of which contribute to severity and increased mortality. 5–7 These immune and non-immune parameters can be integrated into so-called combitypes 8 to identify subgroups of patients with different immune profiles and outcomes, helping to guide clinical strategies.

        <tr id="Introduction. It is now known that 30% of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 develop long-COVID. According to researchers, the reactivation of herpesviruses plays a significant role in triggering long-COVID. In these patients, alteration in lymphocyte populations and T-lymphocyte subpopulations have been observed, yet the nature of these changes remains unclear. The dysregulation of the immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 is further exacerbated by the reactivation of human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6). Therefore, it is essential to distinguish immune response alterations in long-COVID patients based on HHV-6 reactivation and consider these differences when developing therapeutic approaches. 
The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the associative relationships between the number of lymphocyte populations, T-lymphocyte subpopulations, and the severity of the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with long-COVID; 2) to determine and compare the percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD56+, CD8+, CD4/25/127– T-regs and CD19+ cells in long-COVID patients depending on the presence of reactivated HHV-6. 
Materials and methods. In our study, we examined 124 patients, including 73 women (59%) and 51 men (41%), with an average age of 43±9.70 years, all of whom had suffered from COVID-19 in the second half of 2023. To confirm HHV-6 reactivation and form study groups, molecular genetic studies (PCR) were conducted on all patients. Subsequently, flow cytometry was used to analyze the lymphocyte populations and subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from the patients. 
Results. In patients with long-COVID following severe COVID-19, the percentage of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ cells, and CD4+CD25+CD127– T-regs was significantly lower both in the absence of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.014; p=0.016; p=0.045, respectively) and during the active phase of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.045; p=0.005; p=0.008, respectively), compared to the control group. CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased only during the active phase of the herpesvirus (p=0.045). Notably, in the active phase of HHV-6, these cells were further reduced compared to those without herpesvirus reactivation. Additionally, the number of CD19+ B cells was significantly elevated in patients with HHV-6 reactivation, compared to both the control group (p<0.0001) and patients without HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0002). Furthermore, the percentage of CD56+ NK cells in patients with long- COVID following mild and moderate COVID-19 in the history, without HHV-6 reactivation, did not differ significantly from the control group. However, NK cells were significantly lower in patients with long-COVID after severe COVID-19 in the context of HHV-6 reactivation (p=0.0001). 
Conclusions. Our data confirm that HHV-6 reactivation after COVID-19 plays a role in the development of long-COVID. This is mediated through dysregulation of adaptive immune cell interactions, activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and increased production of antibodies with defective structure. Based on our results, patients with long- COVID following severe COVID-19, in the context of HHV-6 reactivation, may have an elevated risk of immunopathological complications, potentially including autoimmune disorders. These findings offer valuable insights for future research and potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects millions globally, leading to severe motor and sensory deficits with no effective clinical treatment. Cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, plays a critical role in bioenergetics and apoptosis. Emerging evidence suggests that CL alterations contribute to secondary SCI pathology, but their precise role and underlying mechanisms remain fully understudied. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of SS-31 on CL alteration, neuronal death, tissue damage, and behavioral recovery after SCI using both in vitro and in vivo models, lipidomics analysis, histological evaluation, and behavioral assessments. In vitro investigations used primary spinal cord neuron cultures, challenged with either rotenone or glutamatergic excitotoxicity, with protective capabilities measured via cell death assays and neurite morphological analysis. In vivo investigations used female adult C57Bl/6 mice, challenged with a contusive SCI. The results showed that SS-31 reduced rotenone- and glutamate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Additionally, SS-31 attenuated rotenone- and glutamate-induced neurite degeneration in vitro. Lipidomics analysis revealed a reduction in CL at 24 h post-SCI in adult mice, which was attenuated by SS-31 in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this effect, SS-31 improved behavioral recovery after SCI in adult mice, although it had no significant effect on tissue damage. These findings suggest that CL alteration may play a key role in the pathogenesis of SCI, at least in the C57BL/6 mouse, and as such could be an attractive therapeutic target for ameliorating secondary SCI.">

        <tr id="The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in late 2019 initiated a global health crisis marked by widespread infection, significant mortality, and long-term health implications. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, recent findings indicate that it also significantly disrupts the human microbiome, particularly the gut microbiota, contributing to disease severity, systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections and chronic conditions. Dysbiosis, or microbial imbalance, exacerbates the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and has been linked to long-COVID, a condition affecting a significant proportion of survivors and manifesting with over 200 symptoms across multiple organ systems. Despite the growing recognition of microbiome alterations in COVID-19, the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the microbiome and influences disease progression remain poorly understood. This narrative review investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on host-microbiota dynamics and evaluates its implications in disease severity and for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Furthermore, it highlights the dual role of the microbiome in modulating disease progression, and as a promising target for advancing diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches in managing COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Background Predicting which patients will develop severe COVID-19 complications could improve clinical care. Peripheral blood cytokine profiles may predict the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but none have been identified in US Veterans. Methods We analyzed peripheral blood cytokine profiles from 202 participants in the EPIC3 study, a prospective observational cohort of US Veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 across 15 VA medical centers. Illness severity was assessed based on the highest level documented during the first 60 days after recruitment. We correlated cytokine levels with illness severity using LASSO logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models on a 70% training set and calculated the AUC on a 30% test set. Results LASSO regression identified 6 cytokines as predictors of SARS-CoV-2 severity with 77.3% AUC in the test set. Random forest and XGBoost models achieved an AUC of 80.4% and 80.7% in the test set, respectively. All models assigned a feature importance to each cytokine, with IP-10, MCP-1, and HGF consistently identified as key markers. Conclusions Cytokine profiles are predictive of SARS-CoV-2 severity in US Veterans and may guide tailored interventions for improved patient management.

While the vaccine has been crucial in reducing COVID-19 risks, rheumatological manifestations are rare. These include new-onset conditions and exacerbations of pre-existing disease, which raise important clinical questions. This narrative literature review aims to synthesize findings from 21 studies on the rheumatological outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination, focusing on clinical presentations, risk factors, pathogenesis, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes. The patients may present with various symptoms, and there can be certain determinants that may predispose the patients to developing these symptoms. The pathogenesis is postulated to be complex, with proposed mechanisms including molecular mimicry and immune dysregulation to explain the onset of rheumatic disease. Both new-onset rheumatological disease and exacerbated rheumatological conditions post-vaccination typically respond well to first-line treatment with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents. Understanding these findings will help clinicians diagnose, manage, and treat post-vaccination rheumatological conditions more effectively.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID‐19 is often complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanisms governing lung injury and repair in ARDS remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that plasma proteomics may uncover protein biomarkers correlated with COVID‐19 ARDS severity. We analyzed the plasma proteome from 32 patients with ARDS and COVID‐19 using an aptamer‐based platform of 7289 proteins, and correlated protein measurements with sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores at days 1 and 7 of ICU admission. We identified 184 differentially abundant proteins correlated with SOFA at day 1 and 46 proteins at day 7. In a longitudinal analysis, we correlated dynamic changes in protein abundance and SOFA between days 1 and 7 and identified 40 significant proteins. Pathway analysis of significant proteins identified increased ephrin signaling and acute phase response signaling correlated with increased SOFA scores between days 1 and 7, while pathways related to pulmonary fibrosis signaling and wound healing had a negative correlation. These findings suggest that persistent inflammation may drive disease severity, while repair processes correlate with improvements in organ dysfunction. This approach is generalizable to future ARDS cohorts for identification of biomarkers and disease mechanisms as we strive towards targeted therapies in ARDS.">

        <tr id="This review explores the therapeutic potential of intranasal chlorpheniramine maleate (iCPM) in managing both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID by integrating histamine H1 receptor antagonism and bitter taste receptor (T2R) activation. Current literature on histamine-mediated inflammation, T2R activation, and the dual-action mechanisms of iCPM were analyzed. Emphasis was placed on its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and mucosal immunity-enhancing properties. iCPM demonstrates significant efficacy in addressing acute COVID-19 symptoms by inhibiting histamine-mediated inflammatory pathways and reducing cytokine storms. As a T2R agonist, it enhances mucosal immunity through nitric oxide production, mucociliary clearance, and antimicrobial peptide synthesis, reducing viral replication and supporting respiratory health. Additionally, iCPM shows promise in mitigating persistent symptoms of long COVID, including fatigue, brain fog, and respiratory dysfunction, by addressing chronic inflammation and residual viral activity. The integration of H1 receptor antagonism and T2R activation positions iCPM as a novel dual-target therapy for respiratory infections. Its localized delivery and broad mechanism of action make it a promising candidate for managing both the acute and chronic phases of COVID-19. Future research should focus on large-scale clinical trials and personalized approaches based on genetic variations in T2R pathways.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, poses significant global health challenges. A key player in its pathogenesis is the nucleocapsid protein (NP), which is crucial for viral replication and assembly. While NPs from other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are known to increase inflammation and cause acute lung injury, the specific effects of the SARS-CoV-2 NP on host cells remain largely unexplored. Recent findings suggest that the NP acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that binds to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), activating NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways. This activation is particularly pronounced in severe COVID-19 cases, leading to elevated levels of soluble ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), which contribute to endothelial dysfunction and multiorgan damage. Furthermore, the NP is implicated in hyperinflammation and thrombosis—key factors in COVID-19 severity and long COVID. Its potential to bind with MASP-2 (mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2) may also be linked to persistent symptoms in long COVID patients. Understanding these mechanisms, particularly the role of the NP in thrombosis, is essential for developing targeted therapies to manage both acute and chronic effects of COVID-19 effectively. This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the multifaceted roles of the NP, highlighting its contributions to viral pathogenesis, immune evasion, and the exacerbation of thrombotic events, thereby providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for mitigating the severe and long-term impacts of COVID-19.">

Consequently, deciphering the intricacies of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 is imperative to identify specific targets for intervention and modulation. With these delicate dynamics in mind, immunomodulatory therapies have emerged as a promising avenue for mitigating the challenges posed by COVID-19. Precision in manipulating immune pathways presents an opportunity to alter the host response, optimizing antiviral defenses while curbing deleterious inflammation. This review article comprehensively analyzes immunomodulatory interventions in managing COVID-19. We explore diverse approaches to mitigating the hyperactive immune response and its impact, from corticosteroids and non-steroidal drugs to targeted biologics, including anti-viral drugs, cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, cell-based therapies (i.e., CAR T, etc.). By summarizing the current evidence, we aim to provide a clear roadmap for clinicians and researchers navigating the complex landscape of immunomodulation in COVID-19 treatment.">

Numerous COVID-19 vaccines have been developed to this effect, including BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines, as well as adenovirus vector-based vaccines such as Oxford–AstraZeneca. However, the emergence of new variants and subvariants of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion, poses significant challenges to the efficacy of current vaccination strategies. In this review, we aim to comprehensively outline the landscape of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and sub-lineages that have recently surfaced in the post-pandemic years. We assess the effectiveness of existing vaccines, including their booster doses, against these emerging variants and subvariants, such as BA.2-derived sub-lineages, XBB sub-lineages, and BA.2.86 (Pirola). Furthermore, we discuss the latest advancements in vaccine technology, including multivalent and pan-coronavirus approaches, along with the development of several next-generation coronavirus vaccines, such as exosome-based, virus-like particle (VLP), mucosal, and nanomaterial-based vaccines. Finally, we highlight the key challenges and critical areas for future research to address the evolving threat of SARS-CoV-2 subvariants and to develop strategies for combating the emergence of new viral threats, thereby improving preparedness for future pandemics.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation is a fundamental feature of many chronic neurodegenerative diseases, where it contributes to disease onset, progression, and severity. This persistent inflammatory state arises from the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses within the central nervous system (CNS), orchestrated by a complex interplay of resident immune cells, infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and an array of molecular mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular vesicles. Among CNS-resident cells, microglia play a central role, exhibiting a dynamic spectrum of phenotypes ranging from neuroprotective to neurotoxic. In chronic neurodegenerative diseases, sustained microglial activation often leads to the amplification of inflammatory cascades, reinforcing a pathogenic cycle of immune-mediated damage. Intercellular communication within the inflamed CNS is central to the persistence and progression of neuroinflammation. Microglia engage in extensive crosstalk with astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells, shaping both local and systemic inflammatory responses. These interactions influence key processes such as synaptic pruning, phagocytosis, blood–brain barrier integrity, and cytokine-mediated signaling. Understanding the mechanisms of cell–cell signaling in this context is critical for identifying therapeutic strategies to modulate the immune response and restore homeostasis. This review explores the key players in CNS neuroinflammation, with a focus on the role of microglia, the molecular pathways underlying intercellular communication, and potential therapeutic approaches to mitigate neuroinflammatory damage in chronic neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <tr id="A mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 invaded the human nervous system. This was confirmed by an increase in biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of COVID-19 patients. To confirm the neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2, a series of analyses were conducted utilizing accessible datasets by MR. In addition, external validation was conducted by testing specific proteins in a retrospective cohort study, which included 40 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications and 15 disease controls (DC). Our investigation revealed the hospitalization, severity of COVID-19 increased the area and volume of certain brain regions, but no other significant causal effects were found of brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) on COVID-19. Notably, the COVID-19 hospitalization significantly increased the area and volume of the left caudal middle frontal gyrus (p_fdr = 0.012; p_fdr = 0.012, respectively). Additionally, COVID-19 severity was linked to the area, volume of the right caudal anterior-cingulate cortex and the volume of the right cuneus cortex (p_fdr = 0.023; p_fdr = 0.025; p_fdr = 0.026, respectively). In the CSF of COVID-19 patients, the median level of CHI3L1 was significantly higher (13677 pg/mL) compared to the DC group (8421 pg/mL, p < 1.00E-04). Similar trends were also found in CSF KLK6 and NGF-β. Additionally, the median NRGN level in plasma was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (1013.00 pg/mL) compared to the control group (360.00 pg/mL, p = 6.50E-03). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 patients experiencing moderate to critical symptoms exhibited higher levels of GFAP in their CSF compared to those without. Elevated CSF levels of GFAP and S100B were also found in COVID-19 patients with decreased consciousness and comorbidities. This MR analysis provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may invade the human nervous system, as indicated by the increased levels of CSF biomarkers CHI3L1, NGF-β, and KLK6 in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggested that neuroinflammation could be a potential mechanism underlying the neurological complications seen in COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Neuropathic pain remains one of the major neurological conditions with high unmet medical needs. Poor translation from preclinical studies using rodent models to clinical trials is one of the major obstacles to the development of new pharmacological medications to treat neuropathic pain. The aims of this study were to establish a behavioral test to evaluate spontaneous pain in a spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model using cynomolgus monkey as a non-human primate (NHP) model. After right unilateral L7 SNL surgery in cynomolgus monkeys, the percentage of weight-bearing on ipsilateral hindlimb significantly decreased, which was well-associated with an analytical score of electroencephalography (EEG). Transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq results from the dorsal part of the spinal cord identified pathways matching those in equivalent rodent models, along with NHP-specific pathways, suggesting that neuroinflammation and cholesterol transportation/metabolism were the main pathways altered in this NHP model. Additionally, several upregulated genes observed here were previously reported uniquely in clinical studies, but not in rodent models. This study provides a potentially useful model that can aid our understanding of pathophysiological mechanism of neuropathic pain and the development of pain relief therapies by inducing a robust behavioral phenotype and changes in gene expression resembling those in patients.">
